EDITORS'  PREFACE. 


The  volume  called  Higher  Mathematics,  the  third  edition 
of  which  was  published  in  1900,  contained  eleven  chapters  by 
eleven  authors,  each  chapter  being  independent  of  the  others, 
but  all  supposing  the  reader  to  have  at  least  a  mathematical 
training  equivalent  to  that  given  in  classical  and  engineering 
colleges.  The  publication  of  that  volume  was  discontinued  in 
1906,  and  the  chapters  have  since  been  issued  in  separate 
Monographs,  they  being  generally  enlarged  by  additional 
articles  or  appendices  which  either  amplify  the  former  pres- 
entation or  record  recent  advances.  This  plan  of  publication 
was  arranged  in  order  to  meet  the  demand  of  teachers  and 
the  convenience  of  classes,  and  it  was  also  thought  that  it 
would  prove  advantageous  to  readers  in  special  lines  of  mathe- 
matical literature. 

It  is  the  intention  of  the  publishers  and  editors  to  add  other 
monographs  to  the  series  from  time  to  time,  if  the  demand 
seems  to  warrant  it.  Among  the  topics  which  are  under  con- 
sideration are  those  of  elliptic  functions,  the  theory  of  quantics, 
the  group  theory,  the  calculus  of  variations,  and  non-Euclidean 
geometry;  possibly  also  monographs  on  branches  of  astronomy, 
mechanics,  and  mathematical  physics  may  be  included.  It  is 
the  hope  of  the  editors  that  this  Series  of  Monographs  may 
tend  to  promote  mathematical  study  and  research  over  a  wider 
field  than  that  which  the  former  volume  has  occupied. 


PREFACE 


This  introduction  to  the  classical  theory  of  invariants  of 
algebraic  forms  is  divided  into  three  parts  of  approximately 
equal  length. 

Part  I  treats  of  linear  transformations  both  from  the  stand- 
point of  a  change  of  the  two  points  of  reference  or  the  triangle 
of  reference  used  in  the  definition  of  the  homogeneous  coor- 
dinates of  points  in  a  line  or  plane,  and  also  from  the  stand- 
point of  projective  geometry.  Examples  are  given  of  invariants 
of  forms  /  of  low  degrees  in  two  or  three  variables,  and  the 
vanishing  of  an  invariant  of  /  is  shown  to  give  a  geometrical 
property  of  the  locus /  =  0,  which,  on  the  one  hand,  is  inde- 
pendent of  the  points  of  reference  or  triangle  of  reference, 
and,  on  the  other  hand,  is  unchanged  by  projection.  Certain 
covariants  such  as  Jacobians  and  Hessians  are  discussed  and 
their  algebraic  and  geometrical  interpretations  given;  in 
particular,  the  use  of  the  Hessian  in  the  solution  of  a  cubic 
equation  and  in  the  discussion  of  the  points  of  inflexion  of 
a  plane  cubic  curve.  In  brief,  beginning  with  ample  illustra- 
tions from  plane  analytics,  the  reader  is  led  by  easy  stages 
to  the  standpoint  of  hnear  transformations,  their  invariants 
and  interpretations,  employed  in  analytic  projective  geometry 
and  modern  algebra. 

Part  II  treats  of  the  algebraic  properties  of  invariants 
and  covariants,  chiefly  of  binary  forms:  homogeneity,  weight, 
annihilators,  seminvariant  leaders  of  covariants,  law  of  reciproc- 
ity, fundamental  systems,  properties  as  functions  of  the  roots, 
and  production  by  means  of  differential  operators.  Any 
quartic  equation  is  solved  by  reducing  it  to  a  canonical  form 
by  means  of  the  Hessian  (§33).  Irrational  invariants  are 
illustrated  by  a  carefully  selected  set  of  exercises  (§  35).

vi  PREFACE 

Part  III  gives  an  introduction  to  the  symbolic  notation 
of  Aronhold  and  Clebsch.  The  notation  is  first  explained  at 
length  for  a  simple  case;  Hkewise  the  fundamental  theorem 
on  the  types  of  symbolic  factors  of  a  term  of  a  covariant  of 
binary  forms  is  first  proved  for  a  simple  example  by  the  method 
later  used  for  the  general  theorem.  In  \dew  of  these  and 
similar  attentions  to  the  needs  of  those  making  their  first 
acquaintance  with  the  symboHc  notation,  the  difiiculties  usually 
encountered  will,  it  is  beHeved,  be  largely  avoided.  This 
notation  must  be  mastered  by  those  who  would  go  deeply 
into  the  theory  of  invariants  and  its  apphcations. 

Hubert's  theorem  on  the  expression  of  the  forms  of  a  set 
linearly  in  terms  of  a  finite  number  of  forms  of  the  set  is  proved 
and  appHed  to  estabHsh  the  finiteness  of  a  fundamental  set 
of  covariants  of  a  system  of  binary  forms.  The  theory  of 
transvectants  is  developed  as  far  as  needed  in  the  discussion 
of  apolarity  of  binary  forms  and  its  appHcation  to  rational 
curves  (§§  53-57),  and  in  the  determination  by  induction  of 
a  fundamental  system  of  covariants  of  a  binary  form  without 
the  aid  of  the  more  technical  supplementary  concepts  employed 
by  Gordan.  Finally,  there  is  a  discussion  of  the  t}'pes  of  s>Tn- 
boHc  factors  in  any  term  of  a  concomitant  of  a  system  of 
forms  in  three  or  four  variables,  with  remarks  on  line  and  plane 
coordinates. 

For  further  developments  reference  is  made  at  appropriate 
places  to  the  texts  in  EngUsh  by  Salmon,  EUiott,  and  Grace 
and  Young,  as  well  as  to  Gordan's  Invariantentheorie.  The 
standard  work  on  the  geometrical  side  of  invariants  is  Clebsch- 
Lindemann,  Vorlesungen  iiber  Geometrie.  Reference  may  be 
made  to  books  by  W.  F.  Meyer,  Apolaritdt  iind  Rationale  Curve, 
Bericht  iiber  den  gegenwarligen  Stand  der  Invariantentheorie,  and 
FormentJieorie.  Concerning  invariant-factors,  elementary  divi- 
sors, and  pairs  of  quadratic  or  bilinear  forms,  not  treated  here, 
see  Muth,  Elementartheiler ,  Bromwich,  Quadratic  Forms  and 
their  Classification  by  Means  of  Invariant  Factors,  and  Bocher's 
Introduction  to  Higher  Algebra.  Lack  of  space  prevents  also 
the  discussion  of  the  invariants  and  covariants  arising  in  the 


PREFACE  vii 

theory  of  numbers;  but  an  elementary  exposition  is  available 
in  the  author's  recent  book,  On  Invaria?its  and  the  Theory  of 
Numbers,  pubKshed,  together  with  Osgood's  lectures  on  func- 
tions of  several  complex  variables,  by  the  American  Mathematical 
Society,  as  The  Madison  Colloquium. 

In  addition  to  numerous  illustrativ^e  examples,  there  are  four- 
teen sets  of  exercises  which  were  carefully  selected  on  the  basis 
of  experience  with  classes  in  this  subject. 

The  author  is  indebted  to  Professor  H.  S.  White  for  suggest- 
ing certain  additions  to  the  initial  list  of  topics  and  for  reading 
the  proofs  of  Part  I.

ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 


PART  I 


ILLUSTRATIONS,    GEOMETRICAL   INTERPRETATIONS    AND 
APPLICATIONS    OF    INVARIANTS    AND    COVARIANTS. 

1.  Illustrations  from  Plane  Analytics.  If  x  and  y  are  the 
coordinates  of  a  point  in  a  plane  referred  to  rectangular  axes, 
while  x'  and  y'  are  the  coordinates  of  the  same  point  referred 
to  axes  obtained  by  rotating  the  former  axes  counter-clock- 
wise through  an  angle  6,  then 

T:  x  =  x' cos  d  —  y' sin  6,     ;y  =  a;' sin  ^+7' cos  ^. 

Substituting  these  values  into  the  linear  function 

l  =  ax-\-by-\-c, 

we  get  a'x' +b'y'  -\-c,  where 

a'  =a  cos  d-\-h  sin  6,     h'  =  —a  sin  d+h  cos  6. 
It  follows  that 

Accordingly,  a?-\-lr  is  called  an  invariant  of  I  under  every 
transformation  of  the  type  T. 

Similarly,  under  the  transformation  T  let 

L  =  Ax^By+C  =  A'x'-^B'y'-\-C, 
so  that 

^'  =  ^  cos  ^+5  sin  ^,     B'  = -Asm  B+B  cos  6.

The  expressions  at  the  right  are  therefore  invariants  of  the 
pair  of  linear  functions  I  and  L  under  every  transformation 
of  type  T.  The  straight  lines  represented  by  1  =  0  and  Z,  =  0 
are  parallel  if  and  only  if  aB  —  bA=0;  they  are  perpendicular 
if  and  only  if  aA-\-bB  =  0.  Moreover,  the  quotient  of  aB  —  bA 
by  aA-\-bB  is  an  invariant  having  an  interpretation;  it  is  the 
tangent  of  one  of  the  angles  between  the  two  Hues. 

As  in  the  first  example,  A^+B'^is  an  invariant  of  L.  Between 
our  four  invariants  of  the  pair  /and  L  the  following  identity 

holds: 

{aA+bBy--{-{aB-bA)^  =  (a^+b'~)(A^+B^-). 

The  equation  of  any  conic  is  of  the  form  5  =  0,  where 

S  =  ax^-i-2bxy-\-cy^-\-2kx-\-  2ly + m . 

Under  the  transformation  T,  S  becomes  a  function  of  x'  and 
y\  in  which  the  part  of  the  second  degree 

F  =  a'x'^+2b'x'y'+c'y'^ 

is  derived  solely  from  the  part  of  S  of  the  second  degree: 

/ = ax~  +  2bxy+cy". 

The  coefficient  a'  of  x'-  is  evidently  obtained  by  replacing 
X  by  cos  d  and  y  by  sin  6  in  /,  while  c'  is  obtained  by  replacing 
X  by  —  sin  6  and  y.  by  cos  d  in  /.     It  follows  at  once  that 

a'-\-c'  =  a-{-c. 

Using  also  the  value  of  b',  we  can  show  that 

a'c'-b'^  =  ac-b^, 

*  We  shall  always  employ  the  rule  which  holds  also  for  the  multiplication 
of  matrices:  the  element  in  the  rth  row  and  sth  column  of  the  product  is  found 
by  multiplying  the  elements  of  the  )-th  row  of  the  first  determinant  by  the  cor- 
responding elements  of  the  5th  column  of  the  second  determinant,  and  adding  the 
products. 


§1]  ILLUSTRATIONS   FROM  ANALYTICS  3 

but  a  more  general  fact  will  be  obtained  in  §  4  without  tedious 
multiplications.  Thus  a+c  and  d^ac  —  h-  are  invariants  of 
/j  and  also  of  S,  under  every  transformation  of  type  T.  When 
5  =  0  represents  a  real  conic,  not  a  pair  of  straight  hues,  the 
conic  is  an  ellipse  ii  d>0,  an  hyperbola  if  (/<0,  and  a  parabola 
if  (^  =  0.  When  homogeneous  coordinates  are  used,  the  classi- 
fications of  conies  is  wholly  different  (§  13). 

If  X  and  y  are  the  coordinates  of  a  point  referred  to  rectan- 
gular axes  and  if  x'  and  ;-'  are  the  coordinates  of  the  same 
point  referred  to  new  axes  through  the  new  origin  (r,  s)  and 
parallel  to  the  former  axes,  respectivel}',  then 
t:  x  =  x'-\rr,     y=y'-\-s. 

All  of  our  former  expressions  which  were  invariant  under 
the  transformations  T  are  also  invariant  under  the  new  trans- 
formations t,  since  each  letter  a,  b,  .  .  .  involved  is  invariant 
under  t.  But  not  all  of  our  expressions  are  invariant  under 
a  larger  set  of  transformations  to  be  defined  later. 

We  shall  now  give  an  entirely  different  interpretation  to 
the  transformations  T  and  /.  Instead  of  considering  {x,  y) 
and  {x\  y')  to  be  the  same  point  referred  to  different  pairs 
of  coordinate  axes,  we  now  regard  them  as  different  points 
referred  to  the  same  axes.  In  the  case  of  /,  this  is  accomplished 
by  translating  the  new  axes,  and  each  point  referred  to  them, 
in  the  direction  from  (r,  s)  to  (0,  0)  until  those  axes  coincide 
with  the  initial  axes.  Thus  any  point  {x,  y)  is  translated  to 
a  new  point  {x' ,  y'),  where 

x'=x—r,    y'=y—s, 
both  points  being  now  referred  to  the  same  axes.     Thus  each 
point  is  translated  through  a  distance  Vr^-\-s^  and  in  a  direction 
parallel  to  the  directed  hne  from  (0,  0)  to  {—r,  —s). 

In  the  case  of  T,  we  rotate  the  new  axes  about  the  origin 
clockwise  through  angle  6  so  that  they  now  coincide  with 
the  initial  axes.  Then  any  point  (x,  y)  is  moved  to  a  new  point 
{x' ,  y')  by  a  clockwise  rotation  about  the  origin  through  angle 
d.     By  solving  the  equations  of  T,  we  get 

x  —X  cos  d-\-y  sin  d,     y'  =  —x  sin  0-f-y  cos  B. 


4  ALGEBRAIC   INVARIANTS 

These  rigid  motions  (translations,  rotations,  and  combinations 
of  them)  preserve  angles  and  distances.  But  the  transformation 
x'  =  2x^  y'  =  2y  is  a  stretching  in  all  directions  from  the  origin 
in  the  ratio  2:1;  while  x' =  2x,  y'  =  y  is  a  stretching  perpen- 
dicular to  the  ;y-axis  in  each  direction  in  the  ratio  2:1. 

From  the  multiplicity  of  possible  types  of  transformations, 
we  shall  select  as  the  basis  of  our  theory  of  invariants  the  very 
restricted  set  of  transformations  which  have  an  interpretation 
in  projective  geometry  and  which  suffice  for  the  ordinary  needs 
of  algebra. 

2.  Projective  Transformations.  All  of  the  points  on  a 
straight  line  are  said  to  form  a  range  of  points.     Project  the 


Fig.  1. 

points  A,  B,  C,  .  .  .  oi  a.  range  from  a  point  V,  not  on  their 
line,  by  means  of  a  pencil  of  straight  lines.  This  pencil  is 
cut  by  a  new  transversal  in  a  range  ^i,  Bi,  Ci,  .  .  . ,  said  to  be 
perspective  with  the  range  A,  B,  C,  .  .  .  .  Project  the  points 
Ai,  Bi,  Ci,  .  .  .  from  a  new  vertex  v  by  a  new  pencil  and  cut  it 
by  a  new  transversal.  The  resulting  range  of  points  A',  B' 
C,  .  .  .  is  said  to  be  projective  with  the  range  A,  B,  C,  .  .  . 
Likewise,  the  range  obtained  by  any  number  o.'  projections 
and   sections  is  called  projective  with  the  given   range,   and 


§2]  PROJECTIVE  TRANSFORMATIONS  5 

the  one-to-one  correspondence  thus  estabhshed  between  cor- 
responding points  of  the  two  ranges  is  called  a  projec- 
tivity. 

To  obtain  an  analytic  property  of  a  projectivity,  we  apply 
the  sine  proportion  to  two  triangles  in  Fig.  1  and  get 

4C^sinj4FC     ^C ^ sin  ^FC 
AV'dnACV    BV~smACV' 

From  these  and  the  formulas  with  D  in  place  of  C,  we  get 

AC^AV  sin  A VC     AD^AT  sin  A VD 
BC     BV' sin  BVC    BD     BV' sin  BVD' 

Hence,  by  division 

AC  .  AD  _  sin  A  VC  .  sin  A  VD 
BC  '  BD  "sin  BVC  '  sin  BVD' 

The  left  member  is  denoted  by  (A  BCD)  and  is  called  the 
cross-ratio  of  the  four  points  taken  in  this  order.  Since  the 
right  member  depends  only  on  the  angles  at  V,  it  follows  that 

{ABCD)  =  {AiBiCiDi), 

if  .4i,  .  .  .  ,  Di  are  the  intersections  of  the  four  rays  by  a 
second  transversal.  Hence  if  two  ranges  are  projective,  the 
cross-ratio  of  any  four  points  of  one  range  equals  the  cross- 
ratio  of  the  corresponding  points  of  the  other  range. 

Let  each  point  of  the  line  AB  he  determined  by  its  dis- 
tance and  direction  from  a  fixed  initial  point  of  the  line;  let 
a  be  the  resulting  coordinate  of  A,  and  b,  c,  x  those  of  B, 
C,  D,  respectively.  Similarly,  let  A',  B',  C,  D'  have  the 
coordinates  a' ,  h' ,  c' ,  x' ,  referred  to  a  fixed  initial  point  on 
their  line.     Then

If  we  multiply  the  elements  of  the  first  column  of  A  by  5  and

if  B  and  A  are  distinct,  so  that  B'  and  A'  are  distinct. 

Hence  a  projectivity  between  two  ranges  defines  a  linear 
fractional  transformation  L  between  the  coordinate  x  of  a 
general  point  of  one  range  and  the  coordinate  x'  of  the  corre- 
sponding point  of  the  other  range.  The  transformation  is 
uniquely  determined  by  the  coordinates  of  three  distinct  points 
of  one  range  and  those  of  the  corresponding  points  of  the  other 
range.  If  the  ranges  are  on  the  same  line  and  if  A'  =  A, 
B'=^B,  C'^C,  then  ^  =  1,  a  =  8,  I3  =  y  =  0,  and  x'  =  x.  Thus 
(ABCD)  =  {ABCD')  implies  D'  =  D. 

Conversely,  if  L  is  any  given  linear  fractional  transfor- 
mation (of  determinant  5^  0)  and  if  each  value  of  x  is  inter- 
preted as  the  coordinate  of  a  point  on  any  given  straight  line 
I  and  the  value  of  x'  determined  by  L  as  the  coordinate  of  a 
corresponding  point  on  any  second  given  straight  line  /',  the 
correspondence  between  the  resulting  two  ranges  is  a  pro- 
jectivity.    This  is  proved  as  follows : 

Let  A,  B,  C,  D  he  the  four'  points  of  I  whose  respective 
coordinates  are  four  distinct  values  Xi,  X2,  X3,  X4:  of  x  such

From  the  first  and  last  we  have  P  =  D,  as  proved  above. 
Holding  xi,  X2,  xz  fixed,  but  allowing  Xi  to  vary,  we  obtain 
two  projective  ranges  on  /  and  /'.  If  ^'  =  yl,  we  use  T  itself 
as  yl^i  and  see  that  the  ranges  are  perspective. 


8  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

If  /  and  /'  are  identical,  we  first  project  the  range  on  /' 
on  to  a  new  line  {A'B'  in  Fig.  2)  and  proceed  as  before. 

Any  linear  fractional  transformation  L  is  therefore  a  pro- 
jective transformation  of  the  points  of  a  line  or  of  the  points 
of  one  line  into  those  of  another  line.  The  cross-ratio  of  any 
four  points  is  invariant. 

3.  Homogeneous  Coordinates  of  a  Point  in  a  Line.  They 
are  introduced  partly  for  the  sake  of  avoiding  infinite  coor- 
dinates. In  fact,  if  7  5^0,  the  value  -8/y  of  x  makes  x' 
infinite.  We  set  a;  =  a;i/a;2,  thereby  defining  only  the  ratio  of 
the  homogeneous  coordinates  xi,  X2  of  a  point.  Leta[;'=:j;iVa[;2'. 
Then,  if  p  is  a  factor  of  proportionaHty,  L  may  be  given  the 
homogeneous  form 

pxi  =aXi-\-^X2,         px2=yxi  +  8x2,        a8- ^y^O. 

The  nature  of  homogeneous  coordinates  of  points  in  a 
line  is  brought  out  more  clearly  by  a  more  general  definition. 
We  employ  two  fixed  points  A  and  B  of  the  line  as  points  of 
reference.  We  define  the  homogeneous  coordinates  of  a  point 
P  of  the  line  to  be  any  two  numbers  x,  y  such  that 

x_  AP 
y'^'pB' 

where  c  is  a  constant  9^0,  the  same  for  all  points  P,  while 
AP  is  a  directed  segment,  so  that  AP=—PA.  We  agree 
to  take  y  =  0  if  P^B.  Given  P,  we  have  the  ratio  of  x  to  y. 
Conversely,  given  the  latter  ratio,  we  have  the  ratio  of  ^P 
to  PB,  as  well  as  their  sum  AP+PB  =  AB,  and  hence  can 
find  AP  and  therefore  locate  the  point  P. 

Just  as  we  obtained  in  plane  analytics  {cf.  §  l)  the  relations 
between  the  coordinates  of  the  same  point  referred  to  two 
pairs  of  axes,  so  here  we  desire  the  values  of  x  and  y  expressed 
in  terms  of  the  coordinates  ^  and  rj  of  the  same  point  P  referred 
to  new  fixed  points  of  reference  A',  B' .  By  definition,  there 
is  a  certain  new  constant  ^5^0  such  that

Hence,  by  division, 

Since  we  are  concerned  only  with  the  ratio  of  x  to  y,  we  may 
set 

Since  the  location  of  A  and  B  with  reference  to  A'  and  B^ 
is  at  our  choice,  as  also  the  constant  c  (and  hence  r  and  s), 
the  values  of  rr]'  and  —r^'  are  at  our  choice,  likewise  srjx  and 
—s^\.  There  is, however,  the  restriction  A  9^B,  whence  ij'^i  j^  r)\  ^' 
Thus  a  change  of  reference  points  and  constant  multiplier  c 
gives  rise  to  a  linear  transformation

of  coordinates,  and  conversely  every  such  transformation  can 
be  interpreted  as  the  formulas  for  a  change  of  reference  points 
and  constant  multiplier. 

4.  Examples  of  Invariants.     The  Unear  functions 
l^ax-\-by,         L=Ax-\-By 
become,  under  the  preceding  linear  transformation  T, 

where 

a'  =  aa-\-hy,         b'  =  al3-\-b5,         A'  =  Aa-\-By,         B'  =  A^+BS.

and  equals  the  product  of  the  resultant  r  —  aB  —  bA  of  the 
given  functions  by  A.  Since  this  is  true  for  every  linear 
homogeneous  transformation  of  determinant  A,  we  call  r  an 
invariant  of  /  and  L  of  index  unity,  the  factor  which  multiplies 
r  being  here  the  first  power  of  A. 

Employing  homogeneous  coordinates  for  points  on  a  line, 
we  see  that  /  vanishes  at  the  single  point  {b,—a)  and  that 
L  =  0  only  at  {B,—A).  These  two  points  are  identical  if 
and  only  if  b  :  a=B  :  A,  i.e.,  if  r  =  0.  The  vanishing  of  the 
invariant  r  thus  indicates  a  geometrical  property  which  is 
independent  of  the  choice  of  the  points  of  reference  used  in 
defining  coordinates  on  the  line;  moreover,  the  property  is 
not  changed  by  a  projection  of  this  line  from  an  outside  point 
and  a  section  by  a  new  line.  Thus  r  =  0  gives  a  projective 
property. 

Among  the  present  transformations  T  are  the  very  special 
transformations  given  at  the  beginning  of  §  1.  Of  the  four 
functions  there  called  invariants  of  /  and  L  under  those  special 
transformations,  r  alone  is  invariant  under  all  of  the  present 
transformations.  Henceforth  the  term  invariant  will  be  used 
only  when  the  property  of  invariance  holds  for  all  linear  homo- 
geneous transformations  of  the  variables  considered. 

Our  next  example  deals  with  the  function 

/  =  ax^ + 2bxy + cy^ . 

The  transformation  T  (end  of  §  3)  replaces  /  by 

F=Ae+2B^v+Cv^ 
in  which 

A  =aa^-\-2bay-\-cy^, 

B  =  aa(3-\-b{a5-\-^j)-\-cy8, 

If  the  discriminant  d  =  ac  —  b^oifis  zero,  /  is  the  square 
of  a  linear  function  of  x  and  v,  so  that  the  transformed  function

F  is  the  square  of  a  linear  function  of  ^  and  77,  whence  the 
discriminant  D  =  AC  —  B^  of  F  is  zero.  In  other  words,  d  =  0 
impHes  D  =  0.  By  inspection,  the  coefficient  of  —b-,  the  highest 
power  of  &,  in  the  expansion  of  D  is 

Thus  D  —  A^d  is  a  hnear  function  bq+r  of  b,  where  q  and  r  are 
functions  of  a,  c,  a,  /3,  7,  6.  Let  a  sind_c  remain  arbitrary,  but 
give  to  b  the  values  Vac  and  —Vac  in  turn.  Since  d  =  0 
and  D  =  0,  we  have 

0=Vac^+r,         0=— Vac^+r, 

whence  f  =  9  =  0,  D  =  A^d.  Thus  c/  is  an  invariant  of  /  of 
index  2.     Another  proof  is  as  follows: 


A^d  = 


a     7

We  just  noted  that  d  =  0  expresses  an  algebraic  property  of 
/,  that  of  being  a  perfect  square.  To  give  the  related  geo- 
metrical property,  employ  homogeneous  coordinates  for  the 
points  in  a  hne.  Then  /=0  represents  two  points  which  coin- 
cide if  and  only  if  d  =  0.  Thus  the  vanishing  of  the  invariant 
d  oi  f  expresses  a  projective  property  of  the  points  represented 
by/=0.

and  only  if  the  invariant  r  is  zero.  The  last  fact  is  an  illus-

6.  Forms  and  their  Classification.  A  function  like  ax^-\-bx^y, 
every  term  of  which  is  of  the  same  total  degree  in  x  and  y, 
is  called  homogeneous  in  x  and  y. 

A  homogeneous  rational  integral  function  oi  x,  y,  .  .  .  is 
called  a  form  (or  quantic)  m  x,  y,  .  .  .  .  According  as  the 
number  of  variables  is  1,  2,  3,  .  .  .  ,  or  ^,  the  form  is  called 
unary,  binary,  ternary,  .  .  .  ,  or  q-ary,  respectively.  Accord- 
,  ing  as  the  form  is  of  the  first,  second,  third,  fourth,  .  .  .  ,  or 
p\h.  order  in  the  variables,  it  is  called  linear,  quadratic,  cubic, 
quartic,  .  .  .  ,  or  p-ic,  respectively. 

For  the  present  we  shall  deal  with  binary  forms.  It  is 
found  to  be  advantageous  to  prefix  binomial  coefficients  to  the 
Hteral  coefficients  of  the  form,  as  in  the  binary  quadratic  and 
quartic  forms 

ax^-{-2bxy-{-cy^,        aox^-\-4:aix^y-^Qa2X^y^-}-4:a3xy^-\-a4y^.

be  replaced  by 

Ao^^+pAie-'v-\-^^~Y^A2e-'v'-\-- .  .+^.^^ 

by  the  transformation  T  (§5)  of  determinant  A?^0.  If,  for 
every  such  transformation,  a  polynomial  I{ao,  .  .  .  ,  ap)  has 
the  property  that

identically  in  ao,  •  •  •  ,  «p,  after  the  ^'s  have  been  replaced 
by  their  values  in  terms  of  the  a's,  then  I{ao,  .  .  .  ,  ap)  is 
called  an  invariant  of  index  X  of  the  form/. 


§7]  DEFINITION  OF  INVARIANTS  15 

If,  for  every  linear  transformation  T  of  determinant  A?^0, 
a  polynomial  K  in  the  coefficients  and  variables  in  /  is  such 
that  * 

K{Aq,  .  .  .  ,Ay\  ^,  r])^A^K(ao,  .  .  .  ,ap;  X,  y), 

identically  in  ao,  .  .  .  ,  ap,  ^,  -q,  after  the  ^'s  have  been  replaced 
by  their  values  in  terms  of  the  a's,  and  after  x  and  y  have 
been  replaced  by  their  values  in  terms  of  ^  and  rj  from  T,  then 
K  is  called  a  covariant  of  index  X  of/. 

The  definitions  of  invariants  and  covariants  of  several 
binary  forms  are  similar. 

These  definitions  are  illustrated  by  the  examples  in  §§4,  5. 
Note  that  /  itself  is  a  covariant  of  index  zero  of  /;  also  that 
invariants  are  covariants  of  order  zero. 

EXERCISES 

1.  The  Jacobian  oi  J=ax--\-2bxy+cy'^  and  L  =  rx-\-sy  is 

J  =  2{as-br)x-\-2{bs-cr)y. 

If  J  is  identically  zero,  f=tL'^,  where  t  is  a  constant.  How  does  this 
illustrate  the  last  result  in  §  5?  Next,  let  /  be  not  identically  zero.  Let 
k  and  /  be  the  values  of  x/y  for  which /=0;  m  that  for  which  L  =  0  and  n 
that  for  which  7  =  0.  Prove  that  the  cross-ratio  (k,  tn,  I,  n)=  —1.  Thus 
the  points  represented  by/=0  are  separated  harmonically  by  those  repre- 
sented by  Z,=0, /=0. 

2.  If  /  is  the  Jacobian  of  two  binary  quadratic  forms /and  g,  the  points 
represented  by  7  =  0  separate  harmonically  those  represented  by  /=0 
and  also  those  represented  by  g  =  0.  Thus  7  =  0  represents  the  pair  of 
double  points  of  the  involution  defined  by  the  pairs  of  points  represented 
by/=Oandg  =  0.

X — +y —  =  nf. 

dx    ^dy      ^ 

Hint :     Prove  this  for  /=  ax^y"  ~  ^  and  for  /=  fi  +f2. 

4.  The  Hessian  of  (ax+by)"'  is  identically  zero. 
Hint :     It  is  sufficient  to  prove  this  for  x^.     Why? 

*  The  factor  can  be  shown  to  be  a  power  of  A  if  it  is  merely  assumed  to  be 
a  function  only  of  the  coefficients  of  the  transformation.

8.  Invariants  of  Covariants.     The  binary  cubic  form 

( 1 )  jXx  ,y)=  ax^ + Zhx-y + 'icxy^ + dy^ 
has  as  a  covariant  of  index  2  its  Hessian  36  h: 

(2)  h  =  rx^  +  2sxy  +  ty'^,  r  =  ac-b~,  2s  =  ad-bc,  t  =  bd-c^. 
Under  any  linear  transformation  of  determinant  A,  let /become 

(3)  F  =  A^^+-Wey}+^Cir^^+Dr^^. 

Let  H  denote  the  Hessian  of  F.     Then  the  covariance  of  h  gives 

(4)  H  =  Re+'^S^r,-\-Tri^~=A^h,  R  =  AC-B\    .  .  . 

Hence  A^r,  2A~s,  A-t  are  the  coefficients  of  a  binary  quadratic 
form  which  our  transformation  replaces  by  one  with  the  coeffi- 
cients R,  25,  T.  Since  the  discriminant  of  a  binary  quad- 
ratic form  is  an  invariant  of  index  2, 

RT-S^  =  AHA^r-AH-{A^sf\=A^{rt-s^). 

Hence  rt  —  s^  is  an  invariant  of  index  6  of/. 

A  Kke  method  of  proof  shows  that  any  invariant  of  a  covariant 
of  a  system  of  forms  is  an  invariant  of  the  forms. 


§9]  CANONICAL  FORM  OF  CUBIC  17 

As  an  example  in  the  use  of  the  concepts  invariants  and 
covariants  in  demonstrations,  we  shall  prove  that  the  invariant  * 

(5)  -  4(r/  -  s^)  =  {ad  -  hcf  -  4(ac  -  h^)  {hd  -  c^) 

is  zero  if  and  only  \i  J{x/y,  l)=0  has  a  multiple  root,  i.e.,  if 
J{x,  y)  is  divisible  by  the  square  of  a  linear  function  of  x  and 
y.  If  the  latter  be  the  case,  we  can  transform  /  into  a  form 
(3)  with  the  factor  ^^]  then  C  =  D  =  0  and  the  function  (5) 
written,  in  capitals  is  zero,  so  that  the  invariant  (5)  itself  is 
zero.  Conversely,  if  (5)  is  zero,  /=0  has  a  multiple  root. 
For,  the  Hessian  (2)  is  then  a  perfect  square  and  hence  can 
be  transformed  into  ^^,  which,  by  the  covariance  of  h,  differs 
only  by  a  constant  factor  from  the  Hessian  R^-  of  the  trans- 
formed cubic  (3) .  Thus6'  =  r  =  0.  IfZ)  =  0,  thenC  =  0(byr  =  0) 
and  (3)  has  the  factor  ^^,  as  affirmed.     If  D^O, 

9.  Canonical  Form  of  a  Binary  Cubic;  Solution  of  Cubic 
Equations.  We  shall  prove  that  every  binary  cubic  form  whose 
discriminant  is  not  zero  f  can  be  transformed  into  X'^-\-Y^. 

For,  if  the  discriminant  (5)  of  the  binary  cubic  (1)  is  not 
2ero,  the  Hessian  (2)  is  the  product  of  two  linear  functions  which 
are  linearly  independent.  Hence  the  cubic  form  /  can  be 
transformed  into  a  form  F  whose  Hessian  (4)  reduces  to  2S^r], 
and  hence  has  i?  =  0,  T  =  Q,  5?^0.  If  C  =  0,  then  5  =  0  (by 
i?  =  0)  and/^  =  .4^3^Z)r7^^Z)?^0  {hy  S^Q).     Taking 

^  =  ^-^Y,         r]=D-'Y, 

we  get  F  =  X^-\-Y^,  as  desired.  The  remaining  case  Cj^O 
is  readily  excluded;  for,  then  Bp^O  (by  r  =  0)  and 

A=~,        D  =  ^,        AD  =  BC,        5  =  0. 
C  B 

*  It  is  often  called  the  discriminant  of/.  It  equals  — a*P/27,  where  P  is  the 
product  of  the  squares  of  the  differences  of  the  roots  oif{x/y,\)  =0.  Other  writers 
call  a^P  the  discriminant  of/. 

t  If  zero,  /  has  a  square  factor  and  hence  can  be  transformed  into  XW  or  X^. 


18  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

To  solve  a  cubic  equation  without  a  multiple  root,  we 
have  merely  to  introduce  as  new  variables  the  factors  ^  and 
7?  of  the  Hessian.     For,  then,  the  new  cubic  is  A  |'^+Z)j?^  =  0. 

To  treat  an  example,  consider  f=x^  +  6x-y  +  12xy-+dy^  —  0.  The  Hes- 
sian is  (d—8)  {xy+2y^).  Hence  we  take  ^  =  ^+23;  and  r]  =  y  as  new 
variables.  We  get  /=  ^'  +  (^—8)77^  If  d  =  9,  we  have  ^^  +  ri^  =  0,  whence 
^/n=  —1,  —  w  or  —co^,  where  w  is  an  imaginary  cube  root  of  unity.  But 
x/y+2=^/r).     Hence  :K;/y=— 3,  —  w— 2,  —  co2-2. 

10.  Covariants  of  Covariants.  Any  covariant  of  a  system 
of  covariants  of  a  system  of  forms  is  a  covariant  of  the  forms. 

The  proof  of  this  theorem  is  similar  to  that  used  in  the 
following  illustrations.  We  first  show  that  the  Jacobian  of 
a  binary  cubic  form  /  and  its  Hessian  A  is  a  covariant  of  index 
3  of/.    We  have 

d(F,H)^^d(f,AVi)_^,d(f,h) 
a(^,  v)         d{x,  y)  d{x,  y)' 

As  the  second  illustration  we  consider  the  forms  /,  L  in 
Ex.  1,  §  7.  Their  Jacobian  is  the  double  of  the  covariant 
K  =  vx-\-wy  of  index  unity,  where 

v  =  as  —  br,        w  =  hs  —  cr. 

Thus  K  and  L  are  covariants  of  the  system  of  forms/,  L.     These 
two   linear   covariants   have   as   an   invariant   their   resultant 


1  = 


V     w 
r     s 


=  as^  —  2brs-\-cr^. 


Under  a  linear  transformation  of  determinant  A,  let  /  become 
A^^+.  .  .  ,  and  L  become  R^+Sr].     By  the  covariance  of  K, 

V^-{-Wv=A(.vx+wy),     V=AS-BR,     W  =  BS-CR. 

Thus  our  transformation  replaces  the  hnear  form  having  the 
coefficients  A^;  and  Aw  by  one  having  the  coefficients  V  and 
W.    Th.  resultant 

Av     Aw 
r       s 


§11]  INTERMEDIATE  INVARIANTS  19 

of  this  linear  form  and  L  is  an  invariant  of  index  unity.     Hence 


V    W 
R      S 


AE, 


V    W 
R      S 


:A2 


V     w 
r      s 


so  that  I  =  vs  —  wr  is  an  invariant  of  index  2  of/  and  L. 

From  the  earlier  expression  for  /,  we  see  that  it  is  the 
resultant  of  /  and  L.  We  have  therefore  illustrated  also  the 
theorem  that  the  resultant  of  any  two  binary  forms  is  an 
invariant  of  those  forms. 

11.  Intermediate  Invariants  and  Covariants.  From  the 
invariant  ac  —  b^  of  the  binary  quadratic  form 

f=ax^-\-  2hxy + cy~ 

we  may  derive  an  invariant  of  the  system  of  forms  /  and  /' 
where 

f  =  a'x^  +  2b'xy+c'y'^. 

Let  any  linear  transformation  replace  /  and  /  by 

If  /  is  any  constant,  the  form/+//  is  transformed  into  F+tF'. 
By  the  invariance  of  the  discriminant  of /+//', 

{A-VtA'){C+tC')-{B+tB'Y^6?\{a+ta'){cMc')-{b+tby\, 

identically  in  /.  The  equahty  of  the  terms  free  of  /  states 
only  the  known  fact  that  ac  —  b^  is  an  invariant  of/.  Similarly 
the  equality  of  the  terms  involving  t^  states  merely  that 
a'c'  —  b"^  is  an  invariant  of/'.  But  from  the  terms  multiplied 
by  i,  we  see  that 
(1)  ac'^a'c-2bb' 

is  an  invariant  of  index  2  of  the  system  of  forms  /,  i' .  It 
is  said  to  be  the  invariant  intermediate  between  their  dis- 
criminants.     It  was  discovered  by  Boole  in  1841. 

The  method  is  a  general  one.  Let  K  be  any  covariant  of 
a  form  jix.y,  .  .  .).  Let  a,  6,  ...  be  the  coefhcients  of  /. 
Let  fix,  y,  .  .  .)  be  a  form  of  the  same  order  with  the  coeffi- 
cients a' ,  b\  .  .  .  .  If  in  iT  we  replace  a  by  a-\-ta',  b  by 
b+tb',  .  .  .  ,  and  expand  in  powers  of  /,  we  obtain  as  the 


20  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

coefficient  of  any  power  r  of  /  a  covariant  of  the  system  /,  /'. 
By  Taylor's  theorem,  this  covariant  is 

in  which  the  symbolic  rth  power  of  9/ 9a  is  to  be  replaced 
by  d'/da',  etc.

2.  Taking  as  K  the  Hessian  (2)  of  cubic  (1)  in  §  8,  obtain  the  covariant

12.  Homogeneous  Coordinates  of  Points  in  a  Plane.     Let 
Li-.  aiX+bty-hct  =  0  (f  =  l,  2,  3)

Interpret  x  and  y  as  the  Cartesian  coordinates  of  a  point 
referred  to  rectangular  axes.  Then  the  equations  represent 
three  straight  lines  Lt  forming  a  triangle.  Choose  the  sign 
before  the  radical  in 

_aiPC-\-hiy_^tCi 

so  that  pi  is  positive  for  a  point  (x,  y)  inside  the  triangle  and 
hence  is  the  length  of  the  perpendicular  from  that  point  to 
Li.  The  homogeneous  (or  trilinear)  coordinates  of  a  point 
{x,  y)  are  three  numbers  Xi,  X2,  xs  such  that 

pXi=kipi,  pX2=k2p2,  pX3=k3p3, 

where  ki,  k2,  ks  are  constants,  the  same  for  all  points.  In 
view  of  the  undetermined  common  factor  p,  only  the  ratios 
of  xi,  X2,  X3  are  defined.

HOMOGENEOUS  COORDINATES

For  example,  let  the  triangle  be  an  equilateral  one  with  sides  of  length 
2,  base  on  the  .r-axis  and  vertex  on  the  y-axis.  The  equations  of  the 
sides  Li,  Li,  Lz  are,  respectively, 


Vz+'=''  vr'='-  "''■ 


Take  each  ^<=1.    Then 


y  +  V3(x-l)             y-Vz{x  +  \) 
pxi= ;; ,  pXi= ,    pX3=y.

The  curve  XiX^^Xi"^  is  evidently  tangent  to  Z,i(i.e.,  Xi  =  0)  at  Q=(010), 
and  tangent  to  Li  at  P=(100).  Substituting  for  the  x<  their  values,  we 
see  that  the  Cartesian  equation  of  the  curve  is 


ix-o 


Fig.  3. 


i{(>'-V3)^-3x=}=y2orx2+(^y+^y-|. 

Hence  it  is  a  circle  with  radius  CP  and  center  at  the  intersection  C  of  the 
normal  to  L^  at  P  with  the  normal  to  Zi  at  Q. 


Changing   the    notation    for    the   coeflScients  of  kipi,   call 
them  a  J,  hi,  d.     Then  we  have

pXi  =  aiX-{-biy-\-Ci,         A?^0

22  ALGEBRAIC   INVARIANTS 

Multiply  the  ith  equation  by  the  cof actor  Ai  of  at  in  the 
determinant  A  and  sum  for  i  =  l,  2,  3.  Next  use  as  multiplier 
the  cofactor  Bt  of  bi]  finally,  the  cofactor  d  of  d.     We  get 

Ax  =  p'EAiXi,  Ay  =  pi:BiXi,  A  =  p^CtXi. 

Hence  x  and  y  are  rational  functions  of  x\,  X2,  xs:

Any  equation  f{x,  y)=0  in  Cartesian  coordinates  becomes, 
by  use  of  (C),  a  homogeneous  equation  (j)(xi,  X2,  X3)=0  in 
homogeneous  coordinates.  The  reverse  process  is  effected  by 
use  of  (H).  In  particular,  since  any  straight  line  is  represented 
by  an  equation  of  the  first  degree  in  x  and  y,  it  is  also  rep- 
resented by  a  homogeneous  equation  of  the  first  degree  in 
Xi,  X2,  X3.  For  example,  the  sides  of  the  triangle  of  reference 
are  xi  =  0,  X2  =  0,  X3  =  0.  Conversely,  any  homogeneous  equation 
of  the  first  degree  in  xi,  X2,  X3  represents  a  straight  line. 
The  degree  of  ^  is  always  that  of  /. 

Take  the  y-axis  as  Li,  the  x-axis  as  L2,  and  let  L3  recede  to  infinity  by 
making  C3  and  63  approach  zero.     Then  (//)  and  (C)  become 

Xi  Xi 

pXi  =  x,     pxi.—y,    pxz=\;    x=-,    y=~.

We  are  thus  led  to  a  very  special,  but  much  used,  method  of  passing  from 
homogeneous  to  Cartesian  coordinates  and  conversely. 

For  a  new  triangle  of  reference,  let  the  homogeneous  coor- 
dinates of  (jc,  y)  be  yi,  y2,  ys-     Then,  as  in  (5'), 

pyi  =  a'iX^rh'iy^rc'i  (i  =  l,2,  3). 

Inserting  the  values  of  x  and  y  from  (C),  we  get  relations  like 

i'.  ryi  =  eax  -\-f1X2  +g<X3  (^  =  1 ,  2,  3) . 

Hence  a  change  of  triangle  of  reference  and  constants  ki, 
k2,  ks  gives  rise  to  a  linear  homogeneous  transformation  /  of 
coordinates.     The  determinant  of  the  coefficients  in  /  is  not 


§13]  PROPERTIES  OF  THE  HESSIAN  23 

zero,  since  yi=0,  >'2  =  0,  y3  =  0  represent  the  sides  of  the 
new  triangle.  Conversely,  any  such  transformation  t  may  be 
interpreted  as  a  change  of  triangle  of  reference  and  con- 
stants ki. 

Instead  of  regarding  t  as  a  set  of  relations  between  the 
coordinates  of  the  same  point  referred  to  two  triangles  of 
reference,  we  may  regard  it  as  defining  a  correspondence  between 
the  points  {xi,  X2,  X3)  and  (yi,  y2,  ys)  of  two  different  planes, 
each  referred  to  any  chosen  triangle  of  reference  in  its  plane. 
This  correspondence  is  projective;  for,  it  can  be  effected  by 
a  series  of  projections  and  sections,  each  projection  being 
that  of  the  points  of  a  plane  from  a  point  outside  of  the  plane 
and  each  section  being  the  cutting  of  such  a  bundle  of  pro- 
jecting lines  by  a  new  plane.  Proof  will  not  be  given  here, 
nor  is  the  theorem  assumed  in  what  follows.  It  is  stated 
here  to  show  that  if  /  is  any  invariant  of  a  ternary  form  / 
under  all  linear  transformations  /,  then  7  =  0  gives  a  projective 
property  of  the  curve  /=C.  It  is  true  conversely  that  any 
projective  transformation  between  two  planes  can  be  effected 
by  a  linear  homogeneous  transformation  on  the  homogeneous 
coordinates.  '  Thus  for  three  variables,  just  as  for  two  (§§  2,  3), 
the  investigation  of  the  invariants  of  a  form  under  all  linear 
homogeneous  transformations  is  of  e^i^ecial  imoortance. 

13.  Properties  of  the  Hessian.  Let  f{xi,  .  .  . ,  Xn)  be  a 
form  in  the  independent  variables  xi,  .  .  . ,  Xn-  The  Hessian 
/j  of  /  is  a  determinant  of  order  w  in  which  the  elements  of

Let  a'  be  the  determinant  obtained  from  A  by  interchanging 
its  rows  and  columns.  In  the  product  A'-M,  the  element 
in  the  rth  row  and  jih  column  is  therefore 

dxi  dyj  dXn  dyj     dyr  dyj 

since  dr  is  the  partial  derivative  of  Xt  with  respect  to  yr.     Hence 

dyrdyj 

Thus  h  is  Si  covariant  of  index  2  of/. 

To  make  an  application  to  conies,  let  /  be  a  ternary  quad- 
ratic form.  Then  h  is  an  invariant  called  the  discriminant 
of/.  Let  (ai,  02,  as)  be  a  point  on  /=0  (for  example,  one 
with  0:3  =  0).  For  Ca=ai  and  Ct2,  Cjs  chosen  so  that  A?^0, 
transformation  T  makes  (x)  =  (a)  correspond  to  (3;)  =  (100). 
Hence  we  may  assume  that  (100)  is  a  point  on/=0,  so  that 
the  term  in  xi^  is  lacking.  Consider  the  terms  xj  with  the 
factor  xi.  If  /^O,  /  involves  only  X2  and  xs  and  hence  is  a 
product  of  two  linear  functions,  while  h  =  0.  In  the  contrary 
case,  we  may  introduce  /  as  a  new  variable  in  place  of  0:2.  This 
amounts  to  setting  l  =  X2, 

f  =  XiX2-\-aX2^-\-bX2X3-\-CX3^. 

Replacing  xi  by  Xi  —  ax2  —  bx3,  we  get  :j;ia;2  — ^^3^,  whose  Hessian 
is  2k.  Hence  /=0  represents  two  (distinct  or  coincident) 
straight  lines  if  and  only  if  the  Hessian  (discriminant)  of  / 
is  zero. 

Moreover,  if  the  discriminant  is  not  zero,  then  k^^O  and  we 
may  replace  Vkxs  by  X3  and  get  0:1^:2— ^3^-  Hence  all  conies, 
which  do  not  degenerate  into  straight  lines,   are  equivalent 


§  13]  PROPERTIES   OF  THE  HESSIAN  25 

under  projective  transformation.  If  the  triangle  of  reference 
is  equilateral  and  the  coordinates  are  proportional  to  the  per- 
pendiculars upon  its  sides,  :riX2— X3^  =  0  is  a  circle  (§  12). 

On  the  contrary,  if  we  employ  only  translations  and  rota- 
tions, as  in  plane  analytics,  there  are  infinitely  many  non- 
equivalent  conies  ;  we  saw  in  §  1  that  there  are  then  two 
invariants  besides  the  discriminant. 

Next,  to  make  an  application  to  plane  cubic  curves,  let 
f{xx,  X2,  xz)  be  a  ternary  cubic  form.  A  triangle  of  reference 
can  be  chosen  so  that  P=(001)  is  a  point  of  the  curve /=0. 
Then  the  term  in  x^^  is  lacking,  so  that 

/  =  ^3-/l+A-3/2+/3, 

where  /«  is  a  homogeneous  function  of  .ri  and  X2  of  degree  /. 
We  assume  that  P  is  not  a  singular  point,  so  that  the  partial 
derivatives  of  /  with  respect  to  Xi,  X2,  and  xa  are  not  all  zero 
at  P.  Hence  /i  is  not  identically  zero  and  can  be  introduced 
as  a  new  variable  in  place  of  xi.  Thus,  after  a  preliminary 
linear  transformation,  we  have 

xz^xi+xz{axi~  -[-hxiX2+cx2^)  +fi. 

Replace  xs  by  xs  —  ^ (axi  -\-bX'2) ■     We  get

where  C  is  a  cubic  function  of  Xi,  X2,  whose  second  partial 
derivative  with  respect  to  Xt  and  Xj  will  be  denoted  by  Cy. 
The  Hessian  of  F  is 


H  = 


If  the  transformation  which  replaced  /  by  F  is  of  deter- 
minant A,  it  replaces  the  Hessian  k  of  /  by  H  =  A~h.  Thus 
H  =  0  represents  the  same  curve  as  h  =  0,  but  referred  to  the 
same  new  triangle  of  reference  as  F  =  0.  We  may  therefore 
speak  of  a  definite  Hessian  curve  of  the  given  curve  f=0.

refer  them  to  the  triangle  of  reference  for  which  their  equations 
aren  =  0,F  =  0. 

The  coefficient  of  xs^  in  H  is  evidently  —  8^.  Thus  P  is  on 
the  Hessian  curve  if  and  only  ii  e  =  0.  li  d  is  the  coefficient  of  X2^ 
in  C,xi=0  meets  7^  =  0 at  the  points  for  which X2"{ex3-\-dx2)  =0 
and  these  points  coincide  (at  F)  if  and  only  if  e  =  0.  In 
that  case,  P  is  called  a  point  of  inflexion  oi  F  =  0  and  a-i=0 
the  inflexion  tangent  at  P.  For  a  cubic  curve  /=0  witJwut  a 
singular  point,  every  point  of  inflexion  is  a  point  of  intersection 
of  the  curve  with  its  Hessian  curve  and  conversely. 

14.  Inflexion  Points  and  Invariants  of  a  Cubic  Curve.  EHm- 
inating  x^  between /  =  0,  A  =  0,  we  obtain  a  homogeneous  relation 
in  Xi,  X2,  which  has  therefore  at  least  one  set  of  solutions  .t'i,  X2- 
For  the  latter  values  of  Xi  and  X2,  /=0  and  h  =  0  are  cubic 
equations  in  xs  with  at  least  one  common  root,  x's.  Hence 
/=0  has  at  least  one  inflexion  point  {x'l,  x'2,  x'3).  After  a 
suitable  linear  transformation,  this  point  becomes  (001).  As 
in  §  13,  we  can  transform  /  into  F,  in  which  e  is  now  zero.  If 
d  =  0,  then  F  =  xiQ,  and  the  derivatives 

=(J-rXi , Xi ,         — — —^i~ 

dxi  9x1  9X2         9x2  9x3         9x3 

all  vanish  at  an  intersection  of  xi=0,Q  =  0.  But  we  assume 
that  there  is  no  singular  point  on/=0  and  thus  none  on  F=0. 
Hence  J  5^0.  Replacing  X2  by  J~*X2,  we  have  an  F  with 
d  =  l.     Adding  a  multiple  of  Xi  to  X2,  we  get 

F=X32xi+C,  C=X2=^+3iX2Xi2+aXi3, 

di     Ci

^=-4X32C22  +  2Xi</.,  <, 

so  that  0  is  the  Hessian  of  C.     By  §  8, 

(f,  =  3Q{  —  b-xr-{-axiX2+bx2^). 
Eliminating  xs^  between  F  =  0,  ^^  =  0,  we  get 

Xi20  +  2C22C=  12(x2*  +  6^)X22xi2+4ax2Xi3-362xi4)  =0. 
If  xi  =  0,   then  X2  =  0  and  we  obtain  the  known  intersection 


§  14]  INFLEXION  POINTS   OF  CUBIC  27 

(001).  For  the  remaining  intersections,  we  may  set  Xi  =  l 
and  obtain  from  eacii  root  r  of 

(1)  r4+6&/^+4ar- 3^2  =  0 

two  intersections  (1,  r,  ix's).  For,  if  x'z  =  ^,  then  C  =  0,  so 
that  (1)  would  have  a  multiple  root,  whence  d?'-\-W'  =  ^.  But 
the  three  partial  derivatives  of  F  would  then  all  vanish  at 
{2b, ~a,  0)  or  (1,0,0),  according  as  ftj^O  or  b  =  0.  Hence  there 
are  exactly  nine  distinct  points  of  inflexion. 

For  each  of  the  four  roots  of  (1),  the  three  points  of  inflexion 
P  and  (1,  r,  ztx's)  are  collinear,  being  on  X2=rxi.  Since  we 
may  proceed  with  any  point  of  inflexion  as  we  did  with  P, 
we  see  that  there  are  9-4/3  or  12  lines  each  joining  three  points 
of  inflexion  and  such  that  four  of  the  lines  pass  through  any 
one  of  the  nine  points.  The  six  points  of  inflexion  not  on  a 
fixed  one  of  these  lines  therefore  lie  by  threes  on  two  new 
lines;  three  such  lines  form  an  inflexion  triangle.  Thus  there 
are  ^12  =  4  inflexion  triangles. 

The  fact  that  there  are    four    inflexion    triangles,    one    for 
each  root  r  of  (1),  can  also  be  seen  as  follows: 

iTH+rF  =  {rxi-X2)\x3~-rx2^-{r^-\-3b)xiX2-{r^-{-Qbr-\-3a)xi^\. 
The  last  factor  equals 

X3'--\rx2+hir^-\-3b)xir-, 
r 

and  hence  is  the  product  of  two  hnear  functions. 

Corresponding  results  hold  for  any  cubic  curve /=0  without 
singular  points.  We  have  shown  that  /  can  be  reduced  to 
the  special  form  7^  by  a  linear  transformation  of  a  certain 
determinant  A.  Follow  this  by  the  transformation  which 
multiplies  xs  by  A  and  Xi  by  A"^^  and  hence  has  the  determin- 
ant A~^  Thus  there  is  a  transformation  of  determinant 
unity  which  replaces  /  by  a  form  of  type  F,  and  hence  replaces 
the  Hessian  h  oi  f  by  the  Hessian  H  of  F.  Hence  there  are 
exactly  four  values  of  r  for  which  i}/  =  h-\-2Arf  has  a  linear  factor 
and  therefore  three  linear  factors.  These  r's  are  the  roots 
of  a  quartic  (l)  in  which  a  and  b  are  functions  of  the  coefi&cients 


28  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

of/.  To  see  the  nature  of  these  functions,  let  Xi—\X2—nX3 
be  a  factor  of  \p.  After  replacing  xi  by  'Kx2+fJiX3  in  \l/,  we 
obtain  a  cubic  function  of  X2  and  X3  whose  four  coefficients 
must  be  zero.  Eliminating  X  and  ai,  we  obtain  two  conditions 
involving  r  and  the  coefficients  of  /  rationally  and  integrally. 
The  greatest  common  divisor  of  their  left  members  is  the 
required  quartic  function  of  r.  Unless  the  coefficient  of  r^  is 
constant,  a  root  would  be  infinite  for  certain  /'s.  The  inflexion 
triangles  of  a  general  cubic  curve  /=0  are  given  by  h-{-2^rf=0, 
where  h  is  the  Hessian  of  f  and  r  is  a  root  of  the  quartic  (1)  in 
which  a  and  b  are  rational  integral  invariants  of  f. 

The  explicit  expressions  for  these  invariants  are  very  long; 
they  are  given  in  Salmon's  Higher  Plane  Curves,  §§  221-2, 
and  were  first  computed  by  Aronhold.  For  their  short  sym- 
bolic expressions,  see  §  65,  Ex.  4. 

EXERCISES

rxi  —  X2  =  yY,  ^rXi±:{rx-i-\-kxx)  =  2yi,  2yi, 
k={r^+2.b)/2,   r^+k  =  l{r'-  +  h)9^Q, 

as  shown  by  use  of  (1),  we  have  the  transformation 

^rXi  =  yn-\-yi,  {r--\-k)xi  =  ryi+D,  {r'^+Ji)x2= —kyi-\-rD, 
where  D  =  y2—y:u     Using  (1)  to  eliminate  a,  show  that 

^  {r".j^b)F  =  -{y-^-y,')  +Zyxyty,--(r^+U)yiK 
8  r  8 

Adding  the  product  of  the  latter  by  54  to  its  Hessian,  we  get  the  product 
of  yiyiyz  by  Z\r'^ +h) / r'^ .  Hence  the  nine  points  of  inflexion  are  found  by 
setting  yi,  y^,  yz  equal  to  zero  in  turn. 

2.  By  multiplying  the  y's  in  Ex.  1  by  constants,  derive

called  the  canonical  form.     Its  Hessian  is  ^%,  where 

// =  -aiS^Si' +S..' +23=')  +  (a3 +2/33)ZiZ223. 

Thus  find  the  nine  inflexion  points  and  show  that  the  four  inflexion  triangles 
are 

ZiZ2Z3  =  0,  2Zi'— 3/2iZiZ3  =  0     (/=!,  w,  w^),

PART   II 


THEORY  OF  INVARIANTS  IN  NON-SYMBOLIC 
NOTATION 

15.  Homogeneity  of  Invariants.  We  saw  in  §  11  that  two 
binary  quadratic  forms  /  and  /'  have  the  invariants 

d  =  ac-b'^,        s  =  ac'+a'c-2bh' 

of  index  2.  Note  that  s  is  of  the  first  degree  in  the  coefficients 
a,  b,  c  oi  f  and  also  of  the  first  degree  in  the  coefficients  of  /', 
and  hence  is  homogeneous  in  the  coefficients  of  each  form 
separately.  The  latter  is  also  true  of  d,  but  not  of  the  invariant 
s-\-2d. 

When  an  invariant  of  two  or  more  forms  is  not  homogeneous 
in  the  coefficients  of  each  form  separately,  it  is  a  sum  of  invariants 
each  homogeneous  in  the  coefficients  of  each  form  separately. 

A  proof  may  be  made  similar  to  that  used  in  the  following 
case.  Grant  merely  that  s-\-2d  is  an  invariant  of  index  2  of 
the  binary  quadratic  forms/  and/'.  In  the  transformed  forms 
(§  11),  the  coefficients  A,  B,  C  oi  F  are  linear  in  a,  b,  c;  the 
coefficients  A',  B' ,  C  of  F'  are  Hnear  in  a',  b',  c' .     By  hypothesis 

AC  ^A'C-2BB'  ^2{AC-B'^)=^\s^2d). 

The  terms  2d!^  of  degree  2  in  a,  b,  c  on  the  right  arise  only 
from  the  part  2(AC-B^)  on  the  left.  Hence  d  is  itself  an 
invariant  of  index  2;  likewise  s  itself  is  an  invariant. 

However,  an  invariant  of  a  single  form  is  always  homo- 
geneous. For  example,  this  is  the  case  with  the  above  dis- 
criminant d  of  /.     We  shall  deduce  this  theorem  from  a  more 

general  one. 

30 


§15]  HOMOGENEITY  OF  INVARIANTS  31 

Let  /  be  an  invariant  of  r  forms  /i,  .  .  .  ,/r  of  orders  p\y 
.  .  .,  pT  in  the  same  q  variables  Xi,  .  .  .  ,  Xq.  Let  a  particular 
term  ^  of  /  be  of  degree  di  in  the  coefficients  of  /i,  of  degree 
d2  in  the  coefficients  of /2,  etc.     Apply  the  special  transformation 

Xi=a^i,  X2=(x^2,  •    •    .,  XQ=a^g, 

of  determinant  A  =a'^.  Then/t  is  transformed  into  a  form  whose 
coefficients  are  the  products  of  those  of  ft  by  a^K  Hence  in 
the  function  /  of  the  transformed  coefficients,  the  term  cor- 
responding to  /  equals  the  product  of  t  by 

This  factor  therefore  equals  A^,  if  X  is  the  index  of  the  invariant. 
Thus 

r 

S  dipi  =  \q. 

Hence  I,dipi  is  constant  for  all  the  terms  of  the  invariant. 

For  the  above  two  quadratic  forms,  r  =  pi  —  pi  =  2.  For  invariant  d, 
we  have  di  =  2,  di  =  0,  '^dipi  =  4:  =  2\.  For  s,  we  have  di  =  d.,=  l,  Zdtpi  =  4:. 
Again,  the  discriminant  (§8)  of  the  binary  cubic  form  is  of  constant  degree 
4  and  index  X  =  6;  we  have  7:dipi  =  i-3  =  2\. 

If,  as  in  the  last  example,  we  take  r  =  l,  we  see  that  an 
invariant  of  index  X  of  a  single  ^-ary  form  of  order  p  is  of 
constant  degree  d,  where  dp  =  X^,  and  hence  is  homogeneous. 

16.  Weight  of  an  Invariant  /  of  a  Binary  Form  f.     Give  to 

I  and/  the  notations  in  §  7.     Let 

be  any  term  of  /,  and  call 

^  =  ^1+2^2+3^3  +  .   .  .+pep 

the  weight  of  /.  Thus  w  is  the  sum  of  the  subscripts  of  the 
factors  Oi  each  repeated  as  often  as  its  exponent  indicates. 
We  shall  prove  that  the  various  terms  of  an  invariant  of  a  binary 
form  are  of  constant  weight,  and  hence  call  the  invariant  isoharic. 
For  example,  aQX^-\-2a\xy-\-a2y^  has  the  invariant  00^2— fli^, 
each  of  whose  terms  is  of  weight  2. 


32  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

To  prove  the  theorem,  apply  to/  the  transformation 

X=^,  y=ari. 

We  obtain  a  form  with  the  Uteral  coefficients 

Ao  =  ao,        Ai=aia,        A2  =  a2a^,  .  .  .  ,  Ap  =  apa^. 

Hence  if  I  is  of  index  X, 

/(go,  aia,  .  .  .  ,  apaP)=a^I{ao,  ai,  .  .  .  ,  Up), 

identically  in  a  and  the  a's.  The  term  of  the  left  member 
which  corresponds  to  the  above  term  /  of  /  is  evidently 

CoQo^o   .    .    .   Qp^'va^. 

Hence  w  =  X.  The  weight  of  an  invariant  of  degree  d  oi  2. 
binary  p-\z  is  thus  its  index  and  hence  (§  15)  equals  \dp. 

17.  Weight  of  an  Invariant  of  any  System  of  Forms.    Let 

/i,  .  .  .  , /„  be  forms  in  the  same  variables  X\^  .  .  .  ,  Xg.  We 
define  the  weight  of  the  coefficient  of  any  term  of  ft  to  be 
the  exponent  of  Xa  in  that  term,  and  the  weight  of  a  product 
of  coefficients  to  be  the  sum  of  the  weights  of  the  factors. 
For  q  =  2,  this  definition  is  in  accord  with  that  in  §  16,  where 
the  coefficient  at  of  a:iP~%2^'  was  taken  to  be  of  weight  k. 
Again,  in  a  ternary  quadratic  form,  the  coefficients  of  xi^, 
a;iit;2  and  X2^  are  of  weight  zero,  those  of  X1X3  and  ::C2^3  of  weight 
unity,  and  that  of  xs^  of  weight  2. 

Under  the  transformation  of  determinant  a, 

Xl  =  §1,  .     .     .   ,  Xq  —I  =^  ^q—l,  Xg  =Q;^j, 

fi  becomes  a  form  in  which  the  coefficient  c'  corresponding 
to  a  coefficient  c  of  weight  k  in  ft  is  ca/^.  If  /  is  an  invariant, 
7(c')^q:V(c),  identically  in  a.  Hence  every  term  of  I  is  of 
weight  X. 

Thus  any  invariant  of  a  single  form  is  isoharic;  any  invariant 
of  a  system  of  two  or  more  forms  is  isoharic  on  the  whole,  hut 
not  necessarily  isoharic  in  the  coefficients  of  each  form  separately. 

The  index  equals  the  weight  and  is  therefore  an  integer  ^  0.

transformations.    Hence 

la"=aa'+/37',i8"=a/3'+/35',7"  =  7a'  +  57',5"  =  7/3'  +  55'. 

Its  determinant  is  seen  to  equal  AA'  and  hence  is  not  zero. 
By  solving  the  equations  which  define  T,  we  get 

,.5       /3  —7       a 

A       A-^  A  A-^ 

These  equations  define  the  transformation  T~^  inverse  to  T\ 
each  of  the  products  TJ"^  and  T~'^T  is  the  identity  trans- 
formation a;  =  X,  y=Y . 

The  product  of  transformation  Tq,  defined  in  §  1,  by  T^'  is  seen  to  equal 
Tgj^Q',  in  accord  with  the  interpretation  given  there.  The  inverse  of 
Tb  is 

T -e:     ^  =  X  cos  e -\-y  ?,\n  e ,     77=  — x  sin  e+y  cos  0. 

Consider  also  any  third  linear  transformation

To  prove  that  the  associative  law 

{Tr)Ti  =  T{T'Ti) 


34  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

holds,  note  that  the  first  product  is  found  by  eliminating  first 
^,  rj  and  then  X,  Y  between  the  equations  for  T,  T,  Ti,  while 
the  second  product  is  obtained  by  eliminating  first  A"^,  Y  and 
then  ^,  7]  between  the  same  equations.  Thus  the  final  eliminants 
must  be  the  same  in  the  two  cases. 

Hence  we  may  write  TT'Ti  for  either  product. 

19.  Generators  of  All  Binary  Linear  Transformations.  Every 
binary  linear  homogeneous  transformation  is  a  product  of  the 
transformations 

Tn:  x=^+nri,        y  =  v; 

S,:  x=^,  y  =  kr)  (k^O); 

V:  x=-v,  y=^- 

From  these  we  obtain  *

V-'StV     =S\:  x  =  kx',        y-^y'  (k^O).

20.  Annihilator   of   an   Invariant   of  a  Binary  Form.     The 

binary  form  in  §  7  may  be  written  as  either  of  the  sums 

/=S  y.\  aiX^-^y  =  ^  y.\  ap-iX'yP-K 

Transformation  V,  of  determinant  unity,  replaces  the  second 
sum  by 

ii^^a,-t{-ly^r>-^r,i, 

Comparing  this  with  the  first  sum  we  see  that  an  invariant 

of /must  be  unaltered  when 

(1)  di  is  replaced  by  {  —  lYap-i      (i  =  0,  1,  .  .  .  ,p),

§  20]  ANNIHILATOR  OF  INVARIANTS  35 

By  §  16,  a  function  I{ao,  ...,  Gp)  is  invariant  with  respect

Finally,  the  function  must  be  invariant  with  respect  to 
every  r»;  under  this  transformation  let 

Differentiating  partially  with  respect  to  n,  we  get 

since  T7  =  y  is  free  of  n,  while  ^  =  x  —  nri.  The  total  coeflScient

the  second  term  being  absent  if  7=0.     But 

Hence] 

dn  dAi  dAo  QA3  ^         QAp 

Now  I(ao,  .  .  .  ,  dp)  is  invariant  with  respect  to  every 
transformation  T„,  of  determinant  unity,  if  and  only  if 

I{Ao,  .  .  .  ,  Ap)=I{aQ,  .  .  .  ,  dp), 

identically  in  n  and  the  a's.     This  relation  evidently  implies 

dljAo,  •  •  •  ,  ^p)  ^Q 

Conversely,  the  latter  implies  that  /(^o,  .  •  . ,  Ap)  has  the 
same  value  for  all  values  of  n  and  hence  its  value  is  that  given 
by  n  =  0,  viz.,  I(ao,  .  .  .  ,  Gp).  Hence  /  has  the  desired  property 
if  and  only  if  the  right  member  of  (2)  is  zero  identically  in 
n  and  the  a's.     But  this  is  the  case  if  and  only  if

Theorem.    A  rational  integral  function  I  of  the  coefficients 

of  the  binary  form  f  is  an  invariant  of  f  if  and  only  if  I  is  iso- 

baric,  is  unaltered   by  the  replacement  (1),  and  is  annihilated 

by  n. 

EXAMPLE 

An  invariant  of  degree  d  of  the  binary  quartic  (§6)  is  of  weight  2d 
(end  of  §  16).  For  J=l,  the  only  possible  term  is  kai]  since  0=U{ka2)

5=— 4r,  i  =  3r,  /  =  r(aoa«-4aia3+3cj*).

expressions  for  w,  show  that  the  degree  d  =  ea+ei+  .  .  .  -{-Cp  is  the  constant 
2w/p. 

21.  Homogeneity  of  Covariants.  A  covariant  which  is  not 
ho}}ws;cncous  in  the  variables  is  a  sum  of  covariants  each  homo- 
geneous in  the  variables. 

For,  il  a,  b,  .  .  .  are  the  coefficients  of  the  forms,  and  K 
is  a  covariant, 

K(A,  B,.  .  .;   ^,v,  ■  •  .)=A^K(a,  b,  .  .  .;  x,  y,  .  .  .). 

When  X,  y,  .  .  .  are  replaced  by  their  linear  expressions  in 
I,  77,  ...  ,  the  terms  of  order  co  in  x,  y,  .  .  .  on  the  right  (and 
only  such  terms)  give  rise  to  terms  of  order  co  in  ^,  7?,  .  .  .  on 
the  left.  Hence,  if  A'l  is  the  sum  of  all  of  the  terms  of  order 
0)  of  K, 

Ki(A,  B,...;^,v,..  .)=A^Ki(a,  b,  .  .  .  ;  x,  y,  .  .  .), 

and  A'l  is  a  covariant.     In  this  way,  K  =  Ki-\-K2  +  .  .  .  . 

Henceforth,  we  shall  restrict  attention  to  covariants  which 
are  homogeneous  in  the  variables,  and  hence  of  constant  order. 

A  covariant  K  of  constant  order  oi  of  a  single  form  f  is  homo- 
geneous in  the  coefficients,  and  hence  of  constant  degree  d. 

For,  let  /  have  the  coefficients  a,  b,  .  .  .  and  order  p,  and 
apply  the  transformation  x  =  a^,  y=aT],  ....  The  coefficients 
of  the  resulting  form  are  A  =aPa,  B=a^b Thus 

K(a^a,a^'b,.  .  .  ;  a-^x,a-^y,.  .  .)^(aiyK(a,b,  .  .  .  ;x,y,  .  .  .)^ 

identically  in  a,  a,  b,  .  .  .  ,  x,  y,  .  .  .  ,  since  the  left  member 


38  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

equals  K(A,  B,  .  .  .  ;  ^,   v,  -  -  ■)-     Now  K  is  homogeneous 
in  X,  y,  .  .  .  ,  of  order  w;  thus 

a-"K(aPa,  aPb,  .  .  .;  X,  y,  .  .  .)=a^^K{a,  b,  .  .  .  ;  x,  y,  .  .  .). 

Thus  if  A'  has  a  term  of  degree  d  in  a,  b,  .  .  .  ,  then 


a-"-aP'^=a«\ 


pd  —  (x}  =  q\, 


so  that  d  is  the  same  for  all  terms  of  A'. 

//  /  is  a  form  of  order  p  in  q  variables  and  if  K  is  a  covariant 
of  degree  d,  order  co  and  index  X,  then  pd  —  w  =  q\. 

22.  Weight  of  a  Covariant  of  a  Binary  Form.     In 

f  =  aQxTP-\-paixP-^y-\-.   .   .-\-i.\aiX^-'y^+.  .  .+apyP 

the  weight  of  at  is  k.  We  now  attribute  the  weight  1  to  :«; 
and  the  weight  0  to  y,  so  that  every  term  of  /  is  of  total 
weight  p. 

Apply  to/  the  transformation  x=^,  y=ar].  The  hteral 
coefficients  of  the  resulting  form  are 

^0  =  ^0,        Ai=aai,  .  .  .,  Ap=aPap. 
If  A  is  a  covariant  of  degree  d,  order  co,  and  index  X,  then 

K(Ao,  .  .  .  ,  Ap]  ^,  7])  =a^K{ao,  .  .  .  ,  ap-,  x,  y). 

Any  term  on  the  left  is  of  the  form 

cAo'oAi'i  .  .  .  Ap'p^^yf  {eo-\-ei+  .  .  .   +ep=d). 

This  equals 

coQ^mi^  .  .  .  ap'vx'y'^-'a^-''       {W  =  r-\-ei+2e2+  .  .  .  +pep). 

This  must  equal  a  term  of  the  right  member,  so  that 
W—<ji  =  \.  But  W  is  the  total  weight  of  that  term.  Hence 
every  term  of  A  is  of  the  same  total  weight.  A  covariant 
of  index  X  and  order  oj  of  a  binary  form  is  isobaric  and  its  weight 
is  co+X. 

For  a  form /of  order  p'm  q  variables,  we  attribute  the  weight  1  to  Xi,  Xi, 
.  .  .  ,  ajj.i  and  the  weight  0  to  Xq\  then  (§  17)  every  term  of/  is  of  total 
weight  p.  By  a  proof  similar  to  the  above,  a  covariant  of  index  X  and  order 
to  of  /  is  isobaric  and  its  weight  is  w+X. 


§23]  ANNIHILATORS  OF  CO  VARIANTS  39 

Consider  a  covariant  K  homogeneous  and  of  total  order  w  in  the  variables 
Xi,  .  .  .  ,  Xq  of  two  or  more  forms  /j.  As  in  §  15,  K  need  not  be  homo- 
geneous in  the  coefificients  of  each  form  separately,  but  is  a  sum  of  co variants 
homogeneous  in  the  coefificients  of  each.  Let  such  a.  K  he  oi  degree  dt  in 
the  coefificients  of /(,  of  order />j.  As  in  ^21,  ^pidt—u  —  qX.  The  total 
weight  oi  K  is  o}  +  \. 

For  example,  ii  pi  =  po  =  q  =  2, 

/i  =  aoX^+2aixy  +a2y-,    fi  =  boX^+2bixy+biy'^. 

The  Jacobian  of  /i  and  fi  is  4^",  where 

K  =  {aohi  —  aibo)x^  +  (aob2— a2bo}xy  +  (aib2  —  a2bi)y''. 
Here 

di  =  d2=l,  w  =  2,  X  =  1 ,  and  K  is  of  weight  3. 

23.  Annihilators  of  Covariants  K  of  a  Binary  Form.  Pro- 
ceeding as  in  §  20,  we  have  instead  of  (2) 

9  AY /I  A  ■  t     \      V    ^KdAj     dK  d^.dKdv

dn  j=odAj  dn      d^  dn     dv  dn 

and  obtain  the  follov^^ing  result:  K  is  covariant  with  respect 
to  every  transformation  x=^  +  «?7,  >'  =  ??,  if  and  only  if  it  is 
annihilated  by  * 

(1)  fi-3'l-  ffi  =  ao-^+.  .  .^pa^-x^

The  binary  form  is  unaltered  if  we  interchange  x  and  y, 
Gi  and  Qp-i  ior  i  =  0,  1,  .  .  .  ,  p.  Hence  A'  is  covariant  with 
respect  to  every  transformation  x=^,  y  =  r}-\-fi^,  if  and  only 
if  it  is  annihilated  by

Denote  a  covariant  of  order  co  of  the  binary  p-'ic  by

*  For  another  derivation,  see  the  corollary  in  §  47. 


40  ALGEBRAIC   INVARIANTS 

By  operating  on  K  by  (2),  we  must  have 
{OS-Si)x''+{OSi-2S'2)x^-'y^.  .  .  +  (06',_] -co^Jx^-^ 

•1.1,-  XT  r-u  +bS^r^O, 

identically  in  x,  y.     Hence  A  becomes 

(3)  K  =  Sx"-hOSx'^-'y-\-hO^Sx''-Y  +  -  •  •+^0"^/', 
whik.by  O6'.  =  0, 

(4)  O"+'6'  =  0. 

Hence   a   covariant   is   uniquely  determined   by  its  leader  S. 
(Cf.  §25). 

Similarly,  K  is  annihilated  by  (l)  if  and  only  if 

(5)  125  =  0,     nSi  =  uS,     1252=(a;-l)5i,     ...,     QS^  =  S^-i. 

The  function  5  of  ao,  •  •  •  ,  dp  must  be  homogeneous  and 
isobaric  (§§21,  22).  If  such  a  function  6*  is  annihilated  by 
Q,  it  is  called  a  seminvariant.  If  we  have  S^,  we  may  find 
6*0,-1  by  (5),  then  8^-2,  •  •  •  ,  and  finally  Si.  But  if  K  is 
a  covariant,  we  can  derive  S^  from  S.  For,  by  §  20,  the 
transformation  x=—-q,  y=i  replaces  /  by  a  form  in  which 
Ai  =  {  —  '[yap-u  by  the  covariance  of  A', 

6'U)r  +  -  •  .=6U)r  +  .  .  .^S{a)x'^-\-.  .  .+6'.(a)r, 

so   that  Soi{a)  =S{A).     Hence  S^  is  derived   from  5  by   the 
replacement  (1)  in  §  20. 

When  the  seminvariant  leader  S  is  given,  and  hence  also  co 
(see  Ex.  1),  the  function  (3)  is  actually  a  covariant  of/;  likewise 
the  function  whose  coefficients  are  given  by  (5).  Proof  will  be 
made  in  §  25.  In  the  following  exercises,  indirect  verification 
of  the  covariance  is  indicated. 

EXERCISES 

1.  The  weight  of  the  leader  5  of  a  covariant  of  order  w  of  a  binary  form 
/  is  W ~u  =  X  and  hence  (§  21)  is  ^(pd—w).     Thus  S  and  /  determine  u. 

2.  The  binary  cubic  has  the  seminvariant  S  =  aoa2  —  ai''.  A  covariant

(aoflo— Ci^)^^  +  (aofls  —  aia2)xy  +  (aiOs  —  a2-)y''. 

Since  this  is  the  Hessian  of  the  cubic,  it  is  a  covariant.

Hence  if  S  is  both  homogeneous  (of  degree  d)  and  isobaric 
{of  weight  w)  in  ao,  .  .  .  ,  dp,  then 

(1)  {W-0^)S  =  oiS,        o}  =  pd-2w. 

A  covariant  with  the  leader  S  has  the  order  w.     (Ex.  1,  §  23.) 
Since  OS  is  of  degree  d  and  weight  w-\-l,  we  have 

(1202  -  0212)5  =  (120  -  012)05 +0(120  -  012)5 
=  (co  -  2)05 +aj05  =  2(co- 1)05. 
Hence  for  r  =  1  and  r  =  2,  we  have 

(2)  (l20'--0^12)5  =  r(co-r  +  l)0'-i5. 
To  proceed  by  induction,  note  that  (2)  implies 

(120^+1 -0'-+il2)5=  (120'--0'-12)05+0^(12C>-Ol2)5 

=  r(co-2-r+l)0'-5+coO'-5  =  (r  +  l)(co-r)0''5, 

so  that  (2)  holds  also  when  r  is  replaced  by  r  +  1. 

25.  Seminvariants  as  Leaders  of  Binary  Covariants. 

Lemma.  //  5  is  a  seminvariant,  not  identically  zero,  of  degree 
d  and  weight  w,  of  a  binary  p-ic,  then  dp  —  2wl0. 

Suppose  on  the  contrary  that  5  is  a  seminvariant  for  which 
w<0,  where  u  =  dp  —  2w.  By  the  definition  of  a  seminvariant, 
125  =  0.     Hence,  by  (2),  §  24, 

(1)  UO'S  =  r{o:-r  +  l)0'-''S  (r  =  l,  2,  3,  .  .  .) 

and  no  one  of  the  coefficients  on  the  right  is  zero.     But 

being  of  degree  d  and  weight  dp  +  l;  in  fact,  the  largest  weight 
of  a  function  of  ao,  .  .  •  ,  dp  oi  degree  d  is  dp,  the  weight  of 
a/.     Then  (1)  for  r  =  dp-wi-l  gives  O'*^-"'5  =  0.      Then  (1) 


§25]  SEMIN VARIANT  LEADERS  OF  COVARIANTS  43 

for  r  =  dp-w  gives  O''^""'-' 5  =  0,  etc.  Finally,  we  get  5  =  0, 
contrary  to  hypothesis. 

Theorem.     There  exists   a   covariant  K  of  a   binary  p-ic 
whose  leader  is  any  given  seminvariant  S  of  the  p-ic. 

The  covariant  K  is  in  fact  given  by  (3),   §  23.     By  (1), 
for  r  =  co4-l, 

fiO"+i5  =  0. 

Hence  0""'"^5'  is  a  seminvariant  of  degree  d  and  weight 

w' =w-\-ii}-\-\  =pd—w-{-l. 

Then  dp-2w'  =  -{pd-2w)-2  is  negative.  Hence  (4),  §23, 
follows  from  the  Lemma.  Thus  K  is  annihilated  by  the 
operator  (2),  §  23.     Next,  in 


^-y^]K, 


the  coefficient  of  x"   y  is 


r 


\w'S—-^U-r+\)0^-'S^-.W^S-r{u^-r+\)0:-'S\, 


which  is  zero  by  (1).  Hence  K  is  covariant  with  respect  to  all 
of  the  transformations  Tn  and  T'n  of  §  19.     Now 

r_irir_i  =  F:      x=-y,      y=x, 

as  shown  by  eliminating  ^,  t],  ^\,  r]i  between 

y=     V,      1  j/  =  »?i  +  ^i,      1  vi=      y. 

Since  K  is  of  constant  weight,  it  is  covariant  with  respect  to 
every  St  (§  16).  Hence,  by  §  19,  K  is  covariant  with  respect 
to  all  binary  linear  transformations. 

26.  Number  of  Linearly  Independent  Seminvariants. 

Lemma.  Given  any  homogeneous  isobaric  function  S  of

we  can  find  a  homogeneous  isobaric  function  Si  of  degree  d  and 
weight  w-\-l  such  that  fi5i  =5.

The  new  right  member  cancels  the  second  term  of  the  new

if  we  sum  from  r  =  l  to  r  =  w-\-l,  the  terms  not  cancelling  are 
those  from  the  first  terms  of  the  left  members,  that  from  the

the  left  for  r=w-]-l.  But  the  last  is  zero,  since  O'^+^6'^0, 
ff''S  being  of  weight  zero  and  hence  a  power  of  ao.  Hence 
we  get  Q,Si=S,  where

Theorem.*  The  number  of  linearly  independent  seminvariants 
of  degree  dand  weight  w  of  the  binary  p-ic  is  zero  if  pd  —  2w<0, 

but  is 

{w;  d,  p)-(w-l;  d,  p), 

if  pd  —  2w't_0,  where  (w;  d,  p)  denotes  the  number  of  partitions 
of  w  into  d  integers  chosen  from  0,  1,  .  .  .  ,  p,  with  repetitions 
allowed. 

If  p^4,  (4;  2,  p)  =  S,  since  4+0,  3  +  1,  2+2  are  the  partitions  of  4  into 
2  integers.  Also,  (3;  2,  p)  =  2,  corresponding  to  3+0,  2  +  1.  Hence  the 
theorem  states  that  every  seminvariant  of  degree  2  and  weight  4  of  the 
binary  p-ic,  p^i,  is  a  numerical  multiple  of  one  such  (see  the  Example 
in  §  20). 

The  literal  part  of  any  term  of  a  seminvariant  6*  specified 
in  the  theorem  is  a  product  of  d  factors  chosen  from  ao,  oi, 
.  .  .  ,  Op,  with  repetitions  allowed,  such  that  the  sum  of  the 
subscripts  of  the  d  factors  is  w.  Hence  there  are  {w;  d,  p) 
possible  terms.  Giving  them  arbitrary  coefficients  and  oper- 
ating on  the  sum  of  the  resulting  terms  with  fi,  we  obtain 
a  linear  combination  S'  of  the  (w  — 1;  d,  p)  possible  products 

*  Stated  by  Cayley;  proved  much  later  by  Sylvester. 


§27]  LAW  OF  RECIPROCITY  45 

of  degree  d  and  weight  w-\.  By  the  Lemma  there  exists* 
an  6"  for  which  9.S  is  any  assigned  S' .  Thus  the  coefficients 
of  our  S'^9,S  are  arbitrary  and  hence  are  hnearly  independent 
functions  of  the  {w;  d,  p)  coefficients  of  S.  Hence  the  con- 
dition S25  =  0  imposes  (w-1;  d,  p)  Hnearly  independent  linear 
relations  between  the  coefficients  of  5  and  hence  determines 
(w— 1;  d,  p)  of  the  coefficients  of  S  in  terms  of  the  remaining 
coefficients.  Thus  the  difference  gives  the  number  of  arbitrary 
constants  in  the  general  seminvariant  S,  and  hence  the  number 
of  linearly  independent  seminvariants  S. 

27.  Hermite's  Law  of  Reciprocity.     Consider  any  partition 

W  =  «l  +  «2  +  .     .     .+«5 

of  IV  into  b^d  positive  integers  such  that  p'^ni^n2  ...  ^  Wj. 
Write  «i  dots  in  a  row;  then  in  a  second  row  write  m  dots 
under  the  first  no  dots  of  the  first  row;  then  in  a  third  row 
write  «3  dots  under  the  first  ns  dots  of  the  second  row,  etc., 
until  w  dots  have  been  written  in  8  rows. 

Now  count  the  dots  by  columns  instead  of  by  rows.  The 
number  nn  of  dots  in  the  first  (left-hand)  column  is  8;  the 
number  m2  in  the  second  column  isj;«i;  etc.  The  number 
of  columns  is  wi  ^  p.     Hence  we  have  a  partition 

w  =  mi-\-m2-\-.  .  .-\-m^ 
of  IV  into  TT  ^  p  positive  integers  not  exceeding  d. 

Hence  to  every  one  of  the  {w;  d,  p)  partitions  of  the  first 
kind  corresponds  a  unique  one  of  the  {w;  p,  d)  partitions  of 
the  second  kind.  The  converse  is  true,  since  we  may  begin 
with  an  arrangement  in  columns  and  read  off  an  arrangement 
by  rows.  The  correspondence  is  thus  one-to-one.  Hence 
(w;  d,  p)  =  {w;  p,  d). 

By  two  apphcations  of  this  result,  we  get 

(w;  d,  p)-{w-l;  d,  p)  =  (w;  p,d)-iw-l;  p,d). 
Hence,  by  the  theorem  of  §  26,  the  number  of  linearly  independent 

♦Provided  />(/-2(!ci-l)>0,  which  holds  if /'(i-2i<:'^0.  But  if  pd-2w<0, 
our  theorem  is  true  by  the  Lemma  in  §  25. 


46  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

seminvariants  of  weight  w  and  degree  d  of  the  binary  p-ic  equals 
the  number  of  weight  w  and  degree  p  of  the  binary  d-ic. 

Let  dp  —  2w  =  o}^0.  Then,  by  the  theorem  of  §25,  each 
seminvariant  in  question  uniquely  determines  a  covariant  of 
order  w. 

The  number  of  linearly  independent  covariants  of  degree 
d  and  order  w  of  the  binary  p-ic  equals  the  number  of  linearly 
independent  covariants  of  degree  p  and  order  w  of  the  binary  d-ic. 

The  covariants  are  of  course  invariants  if  and  only  if  0  =  0.

2.  Show  that  (6;  6,  3)  =  7,  (5;  6,  3)  =  5.  Find  the  two  linearly  inde- 
pendent seminvariants  of  weight  6  and  degree  6  of  the  binary  cubic. 

3.  There  are  only  two  linearly  independent  seminvariants  of  degree 
4  and  weight  4  of  a  binary  quartic.     Find  them. 

4.  There  is  a  single  invariant  or  no  invariant  of  degree  3  of  the  binary 
P-ic  according  as  p  is  or  is  not  a  multiple  of  4.     (Cayley.) 

Hint:  Every  invariant  of  the  binary  cubic  is  a  product  of  a  constant 
by  a  power  of  its  discriminant,  of  order  4  (§  30). 

5.  The  binary  p-ic  has  a  single  covariant  or  no  covariant  of  order  p 
and  degree  2  according  as  p  is  or  is  not  a  multiple  of  4.     (Cayley.) 

Hint:  Every  covariant  of  the  binary  quadratic /is  of  the  type  c  D^f*, 
where  c  is  a  constant  and  D  the  discriminant  of  /  (§  29.)  The  degree  2«+w» 
of  the  product  equals  its  order  2m  if  m  =  2n.  Thus  /  has  a  covariant  of 
order  and  degree  p  if  and  only  if  ^  =  4«,  viz.,  c  Z)"/"". 

6.  No  covariant  of  degree  2  has  a  leader  of  odd  weight.

For  any  such  S,  there  exists  an  ^i  of  partial  degrees  di  and  total  weight

*  This  is  evident  for  A2,  A3,  At.    Further  A's  will  not  be  employed  here.    A 
general  proof  follows  from  §  34. 


48  .  ALGEBRAIC   INVARIANTS 

Since  /'  was  derived  from  /  by  a  linear  transformation  of 
determinant  unity,  any  semin variant  S  oif  has  the  property 


S{ao, 


Hence  any  rational  integral  seminvariant  is  the  quotient 
of  a  polynomial  in  ao,  A2,  .  ■  .  ,  ^j;  by  a  power  of  gq.  For 
/>  ^  4,  we  shall  find  which  of  these  quotients  equal  rational 
integral  functions  of  ao,  .  .  . ,  Op  and  hence  give  rational  integral 
seminvariants.     The  method  is  dua  to  Cayley. 

For  p  =  l,  S  is  evidently  a  numerical  multiple  of  a  power 
of  ao.  Since  co  is  the  leader  of  the  covariant /=aox+aiy  of 
/,  we  conclude  that  every  covariant  of  a  binary  linear  form  / 
is  a  product  of  a  power  of  /  by  a  constant;  in  particular,  there 
is  no  invariant. 

29.  Binary  Quadratic  Form.  Since  A2  does  not  have  the 
factor  ao,  we  conclude  that  every  rational  integral  seminvariant 
is  a  polynomial  in  ao  and  A2.  Now  A 2  is  an  invariant  of  / 
(§4),  and  ao  is  the  leader  of  the  covariant/  of/.  Hence  a 
fundamental  system  of  rational  integral  covariants  of  the  binary 
quadratic  form  f  is  given  hy  f  and  its  discriminant  A2.  We  express 
in  these  words  our  result  that  any  such  covariant  is  a  rational 
integral  function  of/  and  A2. 

30.  Binary  Cubic  Form.  We  seek  a  polynomial  P(ao,  ^2,^3) 
with  the  implicit,  but  not  expHcit,  factor  ao.  Write  A'l  for 
the  terms  of  Ai  free  of  ao: 

(1)  A'2  =  -ai\        A'^  =  2a,K 

We  desire  that  P(0,  A' 2,  ^'3)  =0,  identically  in  ai.     Now 

4^V+^V^0, 

(2)  4.A2^+Az^^ao''D, 

where  D  is  the  discriminant  of  the  cubic  form, 

D  =  a^rr.:r  —  Gaoaia2a3  +4aoa2^ +4ai^a3  —  3ai^a2^. 


§31j  FUNDAMENTAL  SYSTEM  OF  COVAKIANTS  49 

By  means  of  (2)  we  eliminate  As~  and  higher  powers  of 
A3  from  P(ao,  A2,  A 3)  and  conclude  that  any  semin variant 
is  of  the  form  w/ao'^,  where  tt  is  a  polynomial  in  ao,  A2,  A3,  D, 
of  degree  1  or  0  in  yl 3.  li  k>0,  we  may  assume  that  not  every 
term  of  x  has  the  explicit  factor  ao-  In  the  latter  case,  t  does 
not  have  the  implicit  factor  ao-     For,  if  it  did, 

x'  =  7r(0,  A'o,  A's,  D')=0,         D'  =  4:ai^a3-Sai^a2^. 

Since  as  occurs  in  D',  but  not  in  A' 2  or  ^'3,  tt'  is  free  of  D'. 
By  (1),  the  first  power  of  A' 3  is  not  cancelled  by  a  power  of 
A' 2.     Hence  tt'  is  free  of  A' 3  and  hence  of  A'2- 

A  fundamental  system  of  rational  integral  seminvariants  of 
the  binary  cubic  is  given  by  ao,  A2,  A3,  D.  They  are  connected 
by  the  syzygy  (2). 

A  fundamental  system  of  rational  integral  covariants  of  the

(3)  4H^+J-^fW. 

The  last  theorem  follows  from  the  first  one  and  (2),  since 
ao,  A2,  A3  are  the  leaders  of  the  covariants/,  //,  /. 

31.  Binary    Quartic    Form.      We    first    seek    polynomials 

P(ao,  A2,  A3,  Ai)  with  the  impHcit,  but  not  explicit,  factor 
oq.     Thus 

r  =  P{0,A'2,A'3,AU)^0,  A'2=-ai\  A'3  =  1ax\  A\= -Za^K 

The  simplest  P'  is  evidently  3^1 '2" +.4 '4.     We  get 

/44+3/l22  =  ao-/,        /  =  aoa4-4aia3+3a22. 

We  drop  Ai,  and  consider  polynomials  7r(ao,  Ao,  A3,  I)  with 
the  imphcit,  but  not  exphcit,  factor,  ao.  Such  a  polynomial 
is  given  by  (2) ,  §  30.     For  ao  =  0,  D= -ai^I  =  A '2I.     We  have 

A2l-D  =  aQj, 

J  =  aoa2a4  —  aoCa^  +  2aia2a3  —  ai-a4  —  ao^. 
Eliminating  D  between  this  relation  and  (2),  §  30,  we  get 
(1)  ao-V-ao2^2/  +  4^2^+^32  =  0. 


50  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

In  view  of  their  origin,  /  and  /  are  semin variants  of  the 
quartic  /.  Since  they  are  unaltered  by  the  replacement  (1), 
§20,  they  are  invariants  of/  {cf.  §20,  Example  and  Ex.  1). 
In  view  of  (I),  tt  equals  a  polynomial  ^  in  ao,  A2,  A^,  I,  /, 
of  degree  0  or  1  in  ^3.  Suppose  that  (/>  does  not  have  the 
explicit  factor  oq.  Then  the  equal  function  of  ao,  .  .  .  ,  a^  is 
not  divisible  by  Qq.     For,  if  it  were, 

(/)(0,  — fli^,  2ai3,  302^  — 4aia3,  —ai^a^-]-.  .  .)— 0- 

In  view  of  the  term  a^,  <i>  cannot  involve  /,  and  hence  not  /. 
Nor  can  </>  be  linear  in  ^3  in  view  of  the  odd  power  a\^.  Hence  0 
is  free  of  ^3  and  hence  of  ^2. 

A  fundamental  system  of  rational  integral  seminvariants  of 
the  binary  quartic  is  given  by  ao,  A2,  A3,  I,  J.  They  arc  con- 
nected by  the  syzygy  (1). 

A  fundamental  system  of  rational  integral  covariants  of  the 
binary  quartic  f  is  given  by  f,  its  invariants  I  and  J,  its  Hessian 
H  and  the  Jacobian  G  of  f  and  H.      They  are  connected  by  the 
syzygy 
(2)  f^J-fmi-\-im-\-G^^O. 

The  second  theorem  follows  from  the  first  one,  since  ao, 
A2,  A3  are  the  leaders  of  the  covariants/,  H,  G. 

It  would  be  excessively  laborious,  if  not  futile,  to  apply 
the  same  method  to  the  binary  quintic,  whose  fundamental 
system  is  composed  of  23  covariants,*  most  of  which  are 
very  complex.  The  symbolic  method  is  here  superior  both 
as  to  theory  and  as  to  compact  notation  (see  Part  III.).

227,  p.  347. 


§32]  CANONICAL  FORM  OF  QUARTIC  51 

The  reason  there  is  here  a  parameter  m  lies  in  the  existence 
of  two  invariants  /  and  /  of  weights  (and  hence  indices)  4 
and  6,  and  hence  a  rational  absolute  invariant  P/J-,  i.e.,  one 
of  index  zero,  and  consequently  having  the  same  value  for/ 
and  any  form  derived  from  /  by  linear  transformation. 

Since  /  vanishes  for  four  values  of  x/y  and  hence  is  the 
product  of  four  linear  functions,  it  can  be  expressed  (in  three 
ways)  as  a  product  of  two  quadratic  forms,  say  those  in  the 
right  members  of  the  next  equations.  To  prove  our  theorem 
it  suffices  to  show  that  there  exist  constant  p,  q,  r,  s  (each  5^0) 
and  a,  /3  {a  9^0)  such  that 

p(x  -]-ay)~-\-q(x-\-l3y)^  ^  ax^-\-2bxy-\-cy^, 
r(x  +ay)-  +5(x +/3y)-  =  gx^  +  2hxy  +  ky^. 
For,  the  product/  of  these  becomes  (1)  by  the  transformation 

A'  =  '^pr  {x+ay) ,         Y  =  ^qs  {x + ^y) , 
of  determinant  5^0.     The  conditions  for  the  two  identities  are 
p-\-q  =  a,         pa-\-qfi  =  b,         pa'^-\-q0^  =  c, 
r-\-s  =  g,         ra-\-s0  =  k,         ra^-{-s^^  =  k. 
The  first  three  equations  are  consistent  if 

1      1      a 

a      ^      b    ^{^-a)=C-b(a+l3)-\-aa^  =  0. 

If  p  =  0,  or  if  q  =  0,  the  same  equations  give  b'~  =  ac,  so  that  the 
first  quadratic  factor  of  /  and  hence  /  would  have  a  dcuble 
root.     Similarly,  the  last  three  equations  have  solutions  r^^O, 

^-//(a+/3)+ga/3  =  0. 

If  the  determinant  ah  —  bg  is  not  zero,  the  last  two  relations 
determine  a 4-/3  and  a^,  and  hence  give  a  and  /3  as  the  roots  of  * 

{ah  —  bg)z-  —  (ak  —  cg)z-\-bk  —  ch  =  0. 

*  Its  left  member  is  obtained  by  setting  x/y=  —  s  in  the  Jacobian  of  the  two 
quadratic  factors  of  /. 


52  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

If  its  roots  were  equal,  the  two  relations  would  give 

C-2ba-\-aa^  =  0,  k-2ha-\-ga^  =  0, 

and  the  two  quadratic  factors  of/  would  vanish  for  x/y=  -a. 

If  ah-bg  =  0,  but  ch  —  bk^^O,  we  interchange  x  with  y 
and  proceed  as  before.  If  both  determinants  vanish,  either 
b9^0  and  the  second  quadratic  factor  is  the  product  of  the 
first  by  h/b,  or  else  b  =  0  and  hence  h  =  0  and  no  transfor- 
mation of/  is  needed. 

33.  Actual    Determination    of   the    Canonical   Quartic.    Let 

A  denote  the  determinant  of  the  coefficients  of  x,  y  in  A',  Y. 
Then  /,  its  invariants  /  and  /  and  Hessian  H  are  related  to 
the  canonical  form,  its  invariants  and  Hessian,  as  follows: 

/  =  A4(l+3m2),         J^A^(m-m^), 
Zr  =  A2iw(X4+F^)  +  (l-3w2)X2  72|_ 

Thus  A^m  may  be  found  from  the  resolvent  cubic  equation 

4(A2w>^-/(A2w)+/  =  o. 

Then  A*  may  be  found  from  /.  We  may  select  either  square 
root  as  A2  and  hence  fmd  m.  In  fact,  by  replacing  .Y  by 
XV  —  1  in  /,  the  signs  of  A2  and  m  are  changed.  By  elim- 
inating X^+F^,  we  get 

If  9^2=1,  /  is  the  square  of  X'^dzY'^  and  the  discriminant  of 
/  would  vanish.  Hence  we  obtain  XY  by  a  root  extraction. 
Thus  X  and  F  are  determined  up  to  constant  factors  /  and 
t'^.  We  may  find  /  by  comparing  the  coefficients  of  .t^  and 
x^y  in  /  and  the  expansion  of  its  canonical  form,  or  by  use 
of  the  Jacobian  G  oi  f  and  H: 

G  =  ^K\-9m^~)XY{X^-Y^), 

and  combining  the  resulting  X*— F^  with  the  earlier  A^^-f-F'*. 
Or  from/  and  XY  we  can  find  A'2  +  F2  and  then  X±F.

Seminvariants,  Invariants,  and  Covariants  of  a  Binary 
Form/  as  Functions  of  the  Roots  of/=0,  §§  34-37. 

34.  Seminvariants  in  Terms  of  the  Roots.  Give  /  the  nota- 
tion used  in  §  28,  so  that  ai,  .  .  .  ,  ap  are  the  roots  of  /=0. 
After  removing  possible  factors  ^o  from  a  given  seminvariant 
of  /,  we  obtain  a  seminvariant  5  not  divisible  by  qq.  Let 
5  be  the  degree  of  the  homogeneous  function  S  of  the  a's. 
Thus  S  is  the  product  of  a^  by  a  polynomial  in  ai/ciQ,  .  .  .  ,  dp/ao 
of  degree  8.  The  latter  equal  numerical  multiples  of  the  ele- 
mentary S}'mmetric  functions  of  ai,  .  .  .  ,  ap,  each  of  which 
is  linear  in  every  root.  Hence  our  polynomial  equals  a  sym- 
metric polynomial  a  in  ai,  .  .  .  ,  ap  of  degree  5  in  every 
root. 

Since  S  is  of  constant  weight  w  and  since  at/ao  equals  a 
function  of  total  degree  i  in  the  roots,  a  is  homogeneous  in 
the  roots  and  of  total  degree  w  in  them. 

Besides  being  homogeneous  and  isobaric  in  the  a's,  a  sem- 
invariant must  be  unaltered  by  every  transformation  Tn  of 
§  28.  Under  that  transformation,  each  root  is  diminished, 
by  w  (§28).     Since 

ai  =  ai-{-{ai  —  ai)  (^  =  2,.    .   .  ,  p) 

we  can  express  o-  as  a  polynomial  P(ai)  whose  coefficients 
are  rational  integral  functions  of  the  differences  of  the  roots. 
If  P{ai)  is  of  degree  ^1  in  ai,  we  have  P(ai)=P{ai  —  tt),  for 
all  values  of  ?i.  But  an  equation  in  n  cannot  have  an  infinitude 
of  roots.  Hence  P(ai)  does  not  involve  ai,  so  that  a  equals 
a  polynomial  in  the  differences  of  the  roots. 

Multiplying  by  the  factors  ao  removed,  we  obtain  the 
theorem : 

Any  seminvariant  of  degree  d  and  weight  w  of  the  binary 
form  aQX^-\-.  .  .  equals  the  product  of  a(f  by  a  rational  integral 
symmetric  function  a  of  the  roots,  homogeneous  {of  total  degree 
w)  in  tJie  roots,  of  degree  ^  d  in  any  one  root,  and  expressible 
as  a  polynomial  in  the  differences  of  the  roots. 

Conversely,  any  such  product  can  be  expressed  as  a  poly- 
nomial in  the  a's  and  this  polynomial  is  a  seminvariant. 


54  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

Since  the  factor  o-  is  symmetric  in  the  roots,  and  is  of  degree 
^d  in  any  one  root,  its  product  by  ao'^  equals  a  homogeneous 
polynomial  in  the  a's  whose  degree  is  d.  This  polynomial  is 
isobaric  since  a  is  homogeneous,  and  is  unaltered  by  every 
transformation  T„,  since  o-  is  expressible  as  a  function  of  the 
differences  of  the  roots. 

The  importance  of  these  theorems  is  due  mainly  to  the 
fact  that  they  enable  us  to  tell  by  inspection  (without  com- 
putation by  annihilators)  whether  or  not  a  given  function  of 
the  roots  and  ao  is  a  seminvariant.  A  like  remark  applies  to 
the  theorem  in  §  35  on  invariants  and  that  in  §  36  on  covariants.

35.  Invariants  in  Terms  of  the  Roots.  A  seminvariant  of

formation X  =  -  77,  >»  =  H§  20) .     For  the  latter,

The  coefficient  of  ^^  in  the  transformed  binary  form  is

By  §  34,  any  seminvariant  of  /  is  of  the  type 

ao'^2ci(product  of  w  factors  like  ar  —  as). 
Hence  this  is  an  invariant  if  and  only  if  it  equals

pd  is  even.     By  the  total  number  of  a's,  pd  =  2w. 

Any  invariant  of  degree  d  and  weight  w  of  the  binary  form 
aoX^-\-  .  .  .  equals  the  product  of  ai,^  by  a  sum  of  products  of 
constants  and  certain  dij'erences  of  the  roots,  such  that  each  root 
occurs  exactly  d  times  in  every  product;  moreover,  tJie  sum  equals 
a  homogeneous  symmetric  function  of  the  roots  of  total  degree  w. 
Conversely,  the  product  of  any  such  sum  by  ao'^  equals  a  rational 
integral  invariant. 

EXERCISES 

1.  a(,^{ai—a2)-  is  an  invariant  of  the  binary  quadratic  form.  Any

2.  ai,-2(ai— a2)'(«3— 04)'  is  an  invariant  of  the  binary  quartic.

4.  If  we  multiplyrtn^'''"^'  by  the  product  of  the  squares  of  the  differences 
of  the  roots  of  the  binary  p-ic  f,  we  obtain  an  invariant  (discriminant  of 
/) .     Also  verify  that  pd  =  2w. 

5.  The  sum  of  the  coefficients  of  any  seminvariant  is  zero. 
Hint:     Use/=  (x  +  y)^,  whose  roots  are  all  equal. 

6.  Every  invariant  of  the  binary  cubic  is  a  power  of  its  discriminant. 

7.  A  function  which  satisfies  the  conditions  in  the  theorem  of  §  35 
except  that  of  symmetry  in  the  roots  is  called  an  irrational  invariant.  If 
aj,  .  .  .  ,  a4  arc  the  roots  of  a  binary  quartic/,  and 

U=(ai—ai)(a-i—a3),  V=  {a>  —  ai)(a:i—ai) ,  W=  {ai—a2)(a3—a4) , 

why  are  aou,  a„v,  aoW  irrational  invariants  of  /?  They  are  the  roots  of 
z'  — 12/2—  5  =  0,  where  5-  is  the  product  of  ao"  by  the  product  of  the  squares 
of  the  differences  of  the  roots  and  hence  is  the  discriminant  of/.  Hints: 
tt+Z)+w  =  0,  and  s  =  nv-\-iiw-\-mv  is  a  symmetric  function  of  ai,  .  .  . ,  at 
in  which  each  aj  occurs  twice  in  every  product  of  differences,  so  that  ao'^s 
is  an  invariant  of  degree  2.  By  the  Example  in  §20,  ao^s  =  cI,  where  c 
is  a  constant.  To  determine  c,  take  ai  =  l,a2=  —  1,  03  =  2,  «<=  —  2,  so  that 
/=(x2-y2)(;t2-4y2),  7  =  73/12,  u=-Q,  v=l,  w  =  8,  5= -73.  Hence 
c=  — 12.  As  here,  so  always  an  irrational  algebraic  invariant  is  a  root  of  an 
equation  whose  coefficients  are  rational  invariants.

if  the  product  jf  is  identified  with  the  quartic  in  Ex.  7.  Hence  a  simul- 
taneous invariant  of  the  quadratic  factors  of  a  quartic  is  an  irrational  invar- 
iant of  the  quartic.    Why  a  priori  is  the  invariant  three-valued? 

9.  The  cross-ratios  of  the  four  roots  of  the  quartic  are  —v/ii,  etc.  These 
six  are  equal  in  sets  of  three  if  7  =  0.     For,  if  5  =  0,

The  remaining  three  are  the  reciprocals  of  these  and  are  equal. 

10.  By  Ex.  3,  §  11,  one  of  the  cross-ratios  is  —1  if  ac'-f-  .  ,  .  =0.  Why 
does  this  agree  with  Ex.  8? 

11.  The  product  of  the  squares  of  the  differences  of  the  roots  of  the 
cubic  equation  in  Ex.  7  is  known  *  to  be 

—  4.(-12l)^-278'-  =  aoKti-v)-{n-w)-(v-wy. 

Also,*  52  =  256(7' -27/2).      Hence  the  left  member  becomes  3^-4^/2.    Thus

Using  J  from  §  31,  and  the  special  values  in  Ex.  7,  show  that  the  sign  is 
plus.     Verify  that  the  cross-ratios  equal  —1,  —1,  2,  2,  5,  5,  if  7  =  0. 

36.  Covariants  in  Terms  of  the  Roots.  Let  K  (ao,  ■  . .  ,ap\x,  y)

we  see  that  k  equals  a  polynomial  P(ai)  whose  coefficients  are 
rational  integral  functions  of  the  differences  of  x/y,  ai,  .  .  .  ,  ap 
in  pairs.     Since 

K{Ao,  .  .  .  ,  Ap]  ^,  ri)=K{ao,  .  .  .  ,ap;  X,  y),       Ao  =  ao,     r]  =  y, 
we  have        ^1  a'l,  .   .   .  ,  a'p,  -j  =«(  ai,  .   .   .  ,  ap,  -j. 
The  left  member  equals  -P(a'i)  since 

a'i  =  {ai  —  ai)-i-a'i,  -=( ai)-\-ai. 

V    \y       / 
Hence 

P(ai-n)-P(ai)=0 

for  every  n.  Hence  ai  does  not  occur  in  P(ai),  and  k  is  a 
polynomial  in  the  differences  of  x/y,  ai,  .  .  .  ,  ap. 

Let  W  be  the  weight  of  K  and  hence  of  the  coefficient  of 
y.  Then  k  is  of  total  degree  W  in  the  a's  and  of  degree  co 
in  x/y.    Thus 

K  =  2C(|  product  of  w  differences  hke  — aA

Thus  each  term  of  the  sum  involves  every  root  exactly  d  times.

Any  covariant  of  degree  d,  order  co  and  weight  W  of 

ao{x—aiy)  .  .  .  (x—apy) 

equals  the  product  of  ao^  by  a  sum  of  products  of  constants  and 
w  differences  like  x—ary  and  W  —  oj  differences  like  ar—as,  such 
that  every  root  occurs  in  exactly  d  factors  of  each  product;  more- 
over, the  sum  equals  a  symmetric  function  of  the  roots.  Conversely, 
the  product  of  ao^  by  any  such  sum  equals  a  rational  integral 
covariant.

3.  Every  rational  integral  covariant  of  the  binary  quadratic  /  is  a  prod- 
uct of  powers  of  /  and  its  discriminant  by  a  constant. 

37.  Covariant  with  a  Given  Leader  S.  If  the  seminvariant 
S  has  the  factor  ao,  and  S  =  aoQ,  and  if  Q  is  the  leader  of  a 
covariant  K  of  /,  then,  since  ao  is  the  leader  of  /,  S  is  the  leader 
of  the  covariant  fK.  Hence  it  remains  to  consider  only  a 
seminvariant  6*  not  divisible  by  oq.  li  S  is  of  degree  d  and 
weight  w, 

S  =  ao'^XCiiproduct  of  w  factors  like  ar—as), 

where  each  product  is  of  degree  at  most  d  in  each  root,  and 
of  degree  exactly  d  in  at  least  one  root  (§  34).  If  each  product 
is  of  degree  d  in  every  root,  S  is  an  invariant  (§  35)  and  hence 
is  the  required  covariant.  In  the  contrary  case,  let  a2,  for 
example,  enter  to  a  degree  less  than  d;  we  supply  enough 
factors  x—a2y  to  bring  the  degree  in  a2  up  to  d.     Then  ao'^

theorem  in  §  25. 

We  may  now  give  a  new  proof  of  the  lemma  in  §  25  that 
dp  —  2w^0  for  any  semin variant  5  of  degree  d  and  weight 
■w  of  the  binary  p-ic.  Whether  5  has  the  factor  ao  or  not, 
the  first  term  of  the  resulting  covariant  K  is  Sx",  where 
oo  =  dp  —  2w.  For,  in  each  product  in  the  above  S,  the  roots 
ai,  .  .  .  ,  ap  occur  2w  times  in  all.  In  K  each  root  occurs  d 
times.  Hence  we  inserted  dp  —  2w  factors  x—ay  in  deriving  K 
from  S.

Then 

/(C;  ^,  v)  =  A-/(c;  x,  y),        1{C;  ^,  v)  =  A«/(c;  x,  y). 

But  0(^,  ri)  =f{c\  X,  y),  by  the  earlier  notation.     Hence 

^{^,  r})=A-^f{C;    ^,  v),  X(^,  7;)=A-"/(C;    ^,  r?).

The  function  in  the  right  member  is  therefore  a  covariant  of

PART    III 

SYMBOLIC   NOTATION 
The  Notation  and  its  Immediate  Consequences,  §§  39-41 

39.  Introduction.     The  conditions  that  the  binary  cubic 

(1)  f^aoXi^-\-3aiXi"X2-{-3a2XiX2^-\-(i3X2^ 
shall  be  a  perfect  cube 

(2)  (aiXi  -\-a2X2y 

are  found  by  eliminating  ai  and  a2  between 

(3)  ai'^  —  Qo,  ai-a2  =  ai,  axa2~  —  CL2,  a<^=az, 
and  hence  the  conditions  are 

(4)  aoa2  =  ai~,         aia3=a2^. 

Thus  only  a  very  special  form  (1)  is  a  perfect  cube. 

However,  in  a  symbolic  sense  *  any  form  (1)  can  be  rep- 
resented as  a  cube  (2),  in  which  ai  and  0:2  are  now  mere  symbols 
such  that 
(3')  ai'^,  ci^a.2,  aiQ:2~,  0^2 

are  given  the  interpretations  (3),  while  any  linear  combination 
of  these  products,  as  2ai^  —  la2^,  is  interpreted  to  be  the  cor- 
responding combination  of  the  a's,  as  2aQ  —  la2,.  But  no  inter- 
pretation is  given  to  a  polynomial  in  ai,  012,  any  one  of  whose 
terms  is  a  product  of  more  than  three  factors  a,  or  fewer  than 
three  factors  a.  Thus  the  first  relation  (4)  does  not  now  follow 
from  (3),  since  the  expression  0:1^0:2"  (formerly  equal  to  both 

*  Due  to  Aronhold  and   Clebsch,   but   equivalent   to   the  more  complicated 
hyperdeterminants  of  Cajdey.

Gofl2  and  Gi^)  is  now  excluded  from  consideration;  likewise 
for  ai^ao^  and  the  second  relation  (4). 

In  brief,  the  general  binary  cubic  (1)  may  be  represented 
in  the  symbolic  form  (2)  since  the  products  (3')  of  the  symbols 
ai,  02  are  in  effect  independent  quantities,  in  so  far  as  we 
permit  the  use  only  of  linear  combinations  of  these  products. 

But  we  shall  of  course  have  need  of  other  than  linear 
functions  of  oo,  •  .  .,03-  To  be  able  to  express  them  sym- 
bolically, we  represent  /  not  merely  by  (2),  but  also  in  the 
symbolic  forms 

(5)  (/3iXi+/32^2)^,         (71^1+72:^2)^,  .  .  ., 
so  that 

(6)  /3i3  =  ao,    |8i2/32  =  ai,    Pip2^  =  a2,    /32^  =  a3;     71^  =  ^0,  .... 

Thus  aoCf2  is  represented  by  either  ai^/3i/32-  or  jSi^q;iq:2^,  while 
neither  of  them  is  identical  with  the  representation  ara2^i^^2 
of  ai^.     Hence 

aoa2-ai2  =  i(ai3^i/322+|3i3aia22-2ai2a2/3i2^2) 
=  iai/3i(ai^2-a2/3i)2. 

We  shall  verify  that  this  expression  is  a  seminvariant  of 
/.     If 

Xi^Xi-{-tX2.  .r2=A^2, 

then /becomes  F  =  AoXi^-{-.  .  .  ,  where 

Ao  =  ao,     Ai=ai-\-tao,     A2  =  a2-\-2tai-\-fiao, 

^3  =  a3+3/a2+3/2ai+/3ao. 
Hence,  by  (3), 

F  =  {aiXi-{-a  2X2)^,  a  2=oc2-\-tai. 

Similarly,  the  transform  of  (5i)  is 

(iSiXi +^'2X2)3,         |8'2  =  i82+^i8i. 

Hence  we  obtain  the  desired  result 

^0^2-^i2  =  |ai/3i(ai^'2-«'2/3i)2

40.  General  Notations.     The  binary  n-ic 

is  represented  symbolically  as  a^"  =  /3x"  = .  .  .  ,  where 
ax  =  aiXi-\-a2X2,         /3j;  =  /3i.ri +182X2,  .   •   •  , 

a2"  =  a„;  /3i"  =  ao,  .... 
A  product  involving  fewer  than  n  or  more  than  n  factors  ai, 
0:2  is  not  employed  except,  of  course,  as  a  component  of  a 
product  of  n  such  factors. 

The  general  binary  linear  transformation  is  denoted  by 

T:  xi  =  ^iXi  +  -niX2,        X2  =  aA^i  + 7,2X2,         {kri)9^0

where  {^n)  =  hm—  hvi-  It  is  an  important  principle  of  com- 
putation, verified  for  a  special  case  at  the  end  of  §  39,  that 
T  transforms  ax"  into  the  »th  power  of  the  linear  function 

(ai  ^1  -\-0c2  h)X\  +  (ai  7/1  +a:2r?2)-X'2  =a^Xi  +a,X2, 

which  is  the  transform  of  a^  by  T.     Further,

where  (ajS)  =ai/32  —  q:2/3i  =  —  (/3a).     Thus 

(a^^,-a,^J)"  =  (^7,)"(a|8)^ 

so  that  (ai3)"  is  an  invariant  of  ai"=fij^  of  index  «.  Since 
{^aY  represents  the  same  invariant,  the  invariant  is  identically 
zero  if  n  is  odd.

by  taking  a  product  of  w  factors  of  type  ax  and  X  factors  of

preted as  a  polynomial  in  ao,  •  •  •  ,  a»,  ^i,  ^2-  On  the  other

of  A'  in  ao,  ai,  •  •  •  ,  and  co  is  its  order  in  xi,  X2. 

Any  linear  combination  of  such  products  with  the  same

42.  Any  Co  variant  is  a  Polynomial  in  the  ax,  (a^).  This 
fundamental  theorem,  due  to  Clebsch,  justifies  the  symbolic 
notation.  It  shows  that  any  covariant  can  be  expressed  in 
a  simple  notation  which  reveals  at  sight  the  covariant  property. 

While  a  similar  result  was  accomplished  by  expressing 
covariants  in  terms  of  the  roots  (§36),  manipulations  with 
symmetric  functions  of  the  roots  are  usually  far  more  complex 
than  those  with  our  symbolic  expressions. 

The  nature  of  the  proof  will  be  clearer  if  first  made  for 
a  special  case.     The  binary  quadratic  ax^  has  the  invariant 

K  =  aoa2—ai~ 
of  index  2.     Under  transformation  T  of  §  40,  ai^  becomes

It  follows  by  induction  that,  if  r  is  a  positive  integer, 

F'-(^7?)"=(w  +  l)lw(fi-l)  .  .  .  (w-r+2)|2(w-r+l)(^7J)"-^ 
The  case  r  =  n  yields  the  Lemma.

in  which  the  inner  summation  extends  over  various  products 
AB,  where  ^  is  a  product  of  a  constant  and  factors  of  type 
a|,  and  5  is  a  product  of  a  constant  and  factors  of  type  a,. 
Let  Xi=y2,  and  X2^—yi.  Then,  by  solving  the  equations 
of  T,  §  40, 

Xi=yJ{^v),        X2=-yi/{^ri). 

Hence  the  equation  (2)  becomes 

i    2{-iyABy„'^-'yii={^vy+''K. 

t=0 

Since  the  right  member  is  of  degree  X  +  co  in  ^i,  ^2,  and  of 
degree  \-\-co  in  771,  772,  we  infer  that  each  term  of  the  left  mem- 
ber involves  exactly  X  +  co  factors  with  subscript  ^  and  X+w 
factors  with  subscript  rj. 

Operate  with  F^"*""  on  each  member.  By  §  43,  the  right 
member  becomes  cK,  where  c  is  a  numerical  constant  5^0. 
By  §  44,  the  left  member  becomes  a  sum  of  products  each  of 
X+co  determinantal  factors  of  which  co  are  of  t^'pe  {ay)  =  ax, 
and  hence  X  of  type  {a0).  The  last  is  true  also  by  the  definiton 
of  the  index  X  of  K.  Hence  K  equals  a  polynomial  in  the 
symbols  of  the  types  ax,  (a0).

nomial  in  Ki,  .  .  .  ,  Kg  with  numerical  coefl&cients.  We  shall 
now  prove  a  like  theorem  for  the  covariants  of  any  system 
of  binary  forms  of  any  orders.  The  first  proof  was  that  by 
Gordan;  it  was  based  upon  the  symbolic  notation  and  gave 
the  means  of  actually  constructing  a  fundamental  system. 
Cayley  had  earlier  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  fundamental 
system  for  a  binary  quintic  is  infinite,  after  making  a  false 
assumption  on  the  independence  of  the  syzygies  between  the 
covariants.  The  proof  reproduced  here  is  one  of  those  by 
Hilbert;  it  is  merely  an  existence  proof,  giving  no  clue  as  to 
the  actual  covariants  in  a  fundamental  system. 

47.  Reduction  of  the  Problem  on  Covariants  to  one  on  In- 
variants. We  shall  prove  that  the  set  of  all  covariants  of  the 
binary  forms  /i,  ...,/*  is  identical  with  the  set  of  forms 
derived  from  the  invariants  7  of /i,  .  .  .  ,  ft  and  l^xy'  —  x'y 
by  replacing  .r'  by  x  and  y'  by  y  in  each  /.  It  is  here  assumed 
(§  15)  that  7  is  homogeneous  in  the  coefficients  of  /  and  that 
the  covariants  are  homogeneous  in  the  variables. 

Let  the  coefiicients  of  the  /'s  he  a,  b,  ...  ,  arranged  in 
any  sequence.  Let  A,  B,  .  .  .be  the  corresponding  coefficients 
of  the  forms  obtained  by  applying  the  transformation  in  §  5. 
The  latter  replaces  /  by  W-^'t],  where 

r,'=ay'-yx',         ^'  =  bx'-^y'. 

Solving  these,  we  get 

Ax'=a^'+^r?',  ^y'  =  yt'J^bn'. 

Let  I{a,  b,  .  .  .  ;  x',  y')  be  an  invariant  of  /  and  the  /'s. 
Then 

I(A,B,.  .  .;  ^\r,')=AH(a,b,.  .  .;  x',y'). 

Since  7  is  homogeneous,  of  order  w,  in  x',  y',  the  right  member 
equals 

A^-"7((Z,  b,  .  .  .  ;  Ax',  Ay')- 

Hence  we  have  the  identity  in  ^',  rj' : 

liA,  B,.  .  .;  ^',  r?0^A^-<::7(a,  b,  .  .  .  ■  a^'+/3r?',     y^'+W).

Thus  we  may  remove  the  accents  on  ^',  t] .  Then,  by  our 
transformation, 

I{A,B,.  .  .  ;  ^,v)=A^-"I{a,b,.  .  .;  x,y). 

Hence  I  {a,  b,  .  .  .  ;  x,  y)  is  a.  covariant  of /i,  .  .  .  ,  ft  oi  order 
o)  and  index  X  —  co.  * 

The  argument  can  be  reversed.  Note  that  the  sum  of  the 
order  and  the  index  of  a  covariant  is  its  weight  (§  22)  and  hence 
is  not  negative. 

Corollary.  A  covariant  of  the  binary  form  /  has  the 
annhilators  in  §  23. 

For,  an  invariant  of  /  and  xy'  —  x'y  has  the  annihilators

48.  Hilbert's  Theorem.  Any  set  S  of  forms  in  xi,  .  .  .  ,  Xa 
contains  a  finite  number  of  forms  Fi,  .  .  .  ,  F^  such  that  any  form 
F  of  the  set  can  be  expressed  as  F=fiFi-\-.  .  .4-/t^t,  where 
fx,  .  .  . ,  fk  drc  forms  in  xi,  .  .  .  ,  Xn,  but  not  necessarily  in 
the  set  S. 

For  w  =  l,  5  is  composed  of  certain  forms  Cix^\  C2X^\  .... 
Let  Cs  be  the  least  of  the  e's,  and  set  Fi=CsX^K  Then  each 
form  in  5  is  the  product  of  Fi  by  a  factor  of  the  form  cx«,  e  ^  0. 
Thus  the  theorem  holds  when  n  =  l. 

To  proceed  by  induction,  let  the  theorem  hold  for  every 
set  of  forms  in  n  —  \  variables.  To  prove  it  for  the  system 
S,  we  may  assume,  without  real  loss  of  generality,*  that  S 
contains  a  form  Fq  of  total  order  r  in  which  the  coefficient 
of  xj  is  not  zero.  Let  F  be  any  form  of  the  set  5.  By  division 
we  have  F  =  FqP-\-R,  where  i?  is  a  form  whose  order  in  Xn 

*  Let  F  be  a  form  in  5  not  identically  zero  and  let  the  linear  transformation 

Xi  =  Cii3'i+Cj2>'2+.   .  .+Cinyn  (/=L.   .   .  ,  «) 

replace  F(:x:i,  .  .  .  ,Xn)  by  K{yi,  .  .  .  ,  jn)-  In  the  latter  the  coefficient  of  the  term 
involving  only  >'«  is  obtained  from  F  by  setting  Xi  =  cin  and  hence  is  F{cin.,  con,  ■  ■  •  , 
Cnn),  which  is  not  zero  for  suitably  chosen  c's  (Weber's  Algebra,  vol.  T,  p.  457; 
second  edition,  p.  147).  But  our  theorem  will  be  true  for  5  if  proved  true  for 
the  set  of  forms  K. 


§48]  FINITENESS  OF  COVARIANTS  73 

is  <r.  In  i?  we  segregate  the  terms  whose  order  in  x»  is  exactly 
r  — 1,  and  have 

where  M  is  a  form  in  xi,  .  .  .  ,  a-„_i,  while  iV  is  a  form  in 
iCi,  .  .  .  ,  Xn  whose  order  in  Xn  is  :^  /-  —  2.  Each  F  uniquely  deter- 
mines an  M. 

For  the  defmite  set  of  forms  M  in  w  — 1  variables  the  theorem 
is  true  by  hypothesis.  Hence  there  exists  a  fmite  number 
of  the  M's,  say  M\,  .  .  .  ,  Mi  (derived  from  Fi,  .  .  .  ,  F^, 
such  that  any  M  can  be  expressed  as 

where  the/'s  are  forms  in  xi,  .  .  .  ,  x„_i.     Then 

t  =  1 

F  =  FoP'-{-  ^fiF^+R',     P'^P-Zf^P^,     R'^N-Xf,Ni. 

1=1 

Each  exponent  of  Xn  in  R'  is  ^r  — 2.  We  segregate  its  terms 
in  which  this  exponent  is  exactly  r  —  2  and  have 

F  =  FoP'-i-  i  JiF.-hM'xZ-'^+N', 
«=i 

where  M'  is  a  form  in  xi,  .  .  .  ,  Xn-i,  and  N'  a  form  in 
Xi,  .  .  .  ,  x„  whose  order  in  x„  is  ^  r— 3. 

The  theorem  is  apphcable  to  the  set  of  forms  M\  so  that 
each  is  a  linear  combination  of  M\,  .  .  .  ,  M'm,  corresponding 
to  i^'^+i,  .  .  .  ,  Fi+jn,  say.  As  before,  F  differs  from  a  linear 
combination  of  Fq,  .  .  .  ,  Fi+mhy 

M"x/-^-\-N", 

where  M"  is  a  form  in  xi,  .  .  .  ,  Xn-i  and  TV"  is  a  form  whose 
order  in  Xn  is  ^  r  — 4.  Proceeding  in  this  manner,  we  see  that 
F  differs  from  a  linear  combination  of  Fq,  .  .  .  ,  Ft  by  a  form 
R  in  xi,  .  .  .  ,  x„^i.     One  more  step  leads  to  the  theorem. 

49.  Finiteness  of  a  Fundamental  System  of  Invariants.  Con- 
sider the  set  of  all  invariants  of  the  binary  forms /i,  .  .  .  ,  fa, 


74  ALGEBRAIC   INVARIANTS 

homogeneous  in  the  coefi&cients  of  each  form  separately.  By 
the  preceding  theorem,  there  is  a  finite  number  of  these  invariants 
/i,  .  .  .  ,  Im  in  terms  of  which  any  one  of  the  invariants  /  is 
expressible  linearly: 

(1)  /  =  £i/i  +  .  .  .-\-EmIn., 

where  Ej  is  not  necessarily  an  invariant,  but  is  a  polynomial 
homogeneous  in  the  coefficients  of  each  fi  separately. 

Let  ai,  a2,  ...  be  the  coefficients  in  any  order  of/i,  .  .  .  ,/d. 
Let  A  I,  A2,  .  .  .  be  the  coefficients  in  the  same  order  of  the 
forms  obtained  from  them  by  applying  a  linear  transformation 
of  determinant  (l??).     We  may  write 

I{A)  =  {^r,)^I{a),        Ij{A)  =  avrjTj{a),  EAA)=Gj, 

where  Gj  is  a  function  of  the  a's,  |'s,  77's.  From  the  identity 
(1)  in  the  a's,  we  obtain  an  identity  by  replacing  the  a's  by  the 
A's.    Hence 

m 

ihYl^  ^Gji^vYJlj, 

in  which  the  arguments  of  the  /'s  are  a's.  Thus  Gj  is  of  order 
X  — X;  in  ^1,  I2  and  of  order  X  — X^  in  rji,  772.  Operate  on  each 
member  by  V^.     By  §  43,  the  left  member  becomes 

(X  +  1)(X!)2/. 

By  the  formula  to  be  proved  in  §  50,  the  right  member 
becomes 

:^IACo(^r,)'^-^Gj-^C,{h)^^-^+'VGj-h.  .  .+a{^vY^V'Gj\, 

i  =  i 

where  the  C's  are  numerical  constants.  Since  Gj  is  of  order 
v  =  X  — X^  ^  0  in  ^1,  ^2  and  of  order  p  in  771,  772, 

V+'Gj^O,         V^+-Gj  =  0,        ...,         V^Gj  =  0. 

Also  Co,  Ci,  .  .  .  ,  Cy-i  are  zero  since  they  multiply  powers 
of  (^rj)  whose  exponents  —v,  —v-\-l,  .  .  .,  X^  — X+j^— 1=  —  1 
are  negative.     Hence 

m 

(X+l)(X!)2/=  ZljC^VGj. 


§50]  FINITENESS  OF  COVARIANTS  75 

The  torm  obtained  from/t  =  Q;2"  by  our  linear  transformation 
has  the  coefficients  (1),  §  45.  The  polynomial  G]  in  these 
coefficients  is  therefore  a  sum  of  terms  each  a  product  of  a 
constant  by  v  factors  of  type  a^  and  v  factors  of  type  or,. 
Hence,  by  §  44,  VCj  is  a  polynomial  in  the  determinantal 
factors  (a/S)  and  is  consequently  an  invariant  of  the  forms 
fi.    Thus 

m 

1=  S//0, 
where  I'j  is  an  invariant.     Then,  by  (l), 

TO  m 

k=\  i,k=\ 

By  repeating  the  former  process  on  this  /,  we  get 

m 
j,k=\ 

where  the  /"  are  invariants  of  the  forms  ft.  Since  there  is 
a  reduction  of  degree  at  each  step,  we  ultimately  obtain  an 
expression  for  /  as  a  polynomial  m  Ii,  .  .  .  ,  In  with  numerical 
coefficients. 

50.  Lemma.  If  D=  ^ir]2—  ^2Vi,  cind  P  is  homogeneous  {of 
order  X)  in  |i,  ^2,  and  homogeneous  {of  order  n)  in  t/i,  772,  then

First,  we  have

by  Euler's  theorem  for  homogeneous  functions  (§24).  If  P 
is  replaced  by  D"-^P,  so  that  X  and  m  are  increased  by  n  —  1,  we 
get 

VD"P  =  {\-\-fx-\-2n)D''-^P-\-DVD''-'^P. 


76  ALGEBRAIC   INVARIANTS 

Using  this  as  a  recursion  formula,  we  get 

which  reduces  to  the  result  in  §43  if  P  =  l,  whence  X  =  /i  =  0. 
Hence  (1)  holds  when  m  =  l.  To  proceed  by  induction  from 
m  to  w  +  1,  apply  V  to  (1).     Thus 

m 
r=0 

In  the  result  for  VD"'P,  replace  n  by  n—m-\-r  and  P  by 
V^P,  and  therefore  diminish  X  and  m  by  r.     We  get 

Yf£)n-m+rYrp\  _^  £)n -m+r -lyrp   \£)n—m+rYr  +  lp 

where 

tr={n—m-\-r){\-\-ij.  —  r-{-n—m-\-l). 

Hence,  changing  r+l  to  r  in  the  second  summand,  we  get 

m+l 
ym+lj)np^    V    (Crtr  +  Cr-l)D''-'^+'-^V'P, 
r=0 

with  C„,+i  =  0,  C_i  =  0.     Thus  (1)  is  true  for  every  m. 

51.  Finiteness  of  Syzygies.  Let  /i,  .  .  .  ,  7^  be  a  funda- 
mental system  of  invariants  of  the  binary  forms  /i,  .  .  .  ,  fa- 
Let  S{zi,  .  .  .  ,  Zm)  he  a.  polynomial  with  numerical  coefficients 
such  that  S(Ii,  .  .  .  ,  /w),Vhen  expressed  as  a  function  of  the 
coeflficients  c  of  the  /'s,  is  identically  zero  in  the  c's.  Then 
5(7)  =  0  is  a  syzygy  between  the  invariants. 

By  means  of  a  new  variable  z^+i,  construct  the  homogeneous 
form  5'(zi,  .  .  .,  z^+i)  corresponding  to  S.  By  §48,  the 
forms  S'  are  expressible  linearly  in  terms  of  a  finite  number 
S\,  .  .  .  ,  yt  of  them.     Take  2^+1  =  L      Thus 

(1)  5  =  Ci5i  +  .  .  .+CA 

where  Ci,  .  .  .  ,  Ct  are  polynomials  in  zi,  .  .  .  ,  z„,.  Take 
zi  =Ii,  .  .  .  ,  Zm  =  Im-  Hence  there  is  a  finite  number  of  syzygies 
Si=0,  .  .  .,  St  =  0,  such  that  any  syzygy  5  =  0  implies  a 
relation  (l)  in  which  Ci,  .  .  .  ,  C*  are  invariants.  In  particular, 
every  syzygy  is  a  consequence  of  5i  =  0,  .  .  .  ,  5t  =  0. 


§  52]  TRANSVECTANTS  77 

52.  Trans vectants.      Any  two  binary  forms 

have  the  covariant 

(1)  (/,  0)'-  =  (a^)'-«/-'-/3i-'-, 

called  the  rth.  transvectant  (Ueberschiebung)  of  /  and  <^,  and 
due  to  Caj'ley.  It  is  their  product  if  r  =  0,  their  Jacobian 
if  r  =  l,  and  their  Hessian  \i  J=<t>  and  r  =  2,  provided  numerical 
factors  are  ignored  (Exs.  4,  5,  §  40). 

It  may  be  obtained  by  differentiation  and  without  the  use 
of  the  symbolic  notation.     In  fact,  a  special  case  of  (l),  §  44,  is 

so  that  if/  is  of  order  k  and  4>  of  order  /, 

(2)  im,  0(^))^  =  fc^'  ^^[F'-/(^)c/>fr,)l,  =  ,. 


x\ftcr/(ti,  ^2)-4>(m,  m)  is  operated  on  by  V,  we  set  771  =  ^1, 
For  example,  let /(^)=a^a^,  </.($)  =  7^\  P^a^S^y  '.     Then 


d^idvi  ^  *  9^29771  *  * 

The  difference  is  VP.     Taking  r]i=  ^i,  772=  I2,  we  get 

The  numerical  factor  in  (2)  is  here  I/6.     Hence 

(3)  ^<^j  y,')'  =  h{0yh^yf+K'xy)0^y^'. 

In  general,  consider  the  two  forms 
Then  by  (l),  §  44,  and  the  Corollary,  and  by  (2), 

where  the  summation  extends  over  all  the  combinations  of  the 


78  ALGEBRAIC   INVARIANTS 

as  r  at  a  time,  and  over  all  the  permutations  of  the  /S's  r  at 
a  time.  Thus  the  number  of  terms  in  the  sum  is  the  reciprocal 
of  the  factor  preceding  S. 

If  the  a's  are  identified  and  also  the  /3's,  (4)  becomes  (1).  li  k  =  2, 
l=S,  r=l,  we  have  one-sixth  of  a  sum  of  six  terms;  then  if  the  /3's  are 
identified  we  have  two  sets  of  three  equal  terms  and  obtain  (3). 

Since  F  is  a  differential  operator,  (2)  gives 
(5)  (2c/,,  i:kj<f>jy  =  ^^cMft,  4>,)r. 

Apolarity;  Rational  Curves,  §§  53-57 

53.  Binary  Forms  Apolar  to  a  Given  Form.  Two  binary 
quadratic  forms  are  called  apolar  if  their  lineo-linear  invariant 
is  zero;  then  they  are  harmonic  (Ex.  3,  §  11).  In  general, 
the  binary  forms 

i=Q\l/  i=o\t/ 

of  the  same  order,  are  called  apolar  if 

(1)  {a^y'^=lji-i)'(jyA.-i=o. 

In  particular,  /  is  apolar  to  itself  if  n  is  odd  (Ex.  4,  §  38). 

Let  the  actual  linear  factors  of  <^  be  /3x^^\  •  •  •  ,  /3j'^"^  By 
(1),  (4),  §  52, 

(a^)"  =  (a/,     /3,(i>   .   .   .  /3,("))"  =  (a|3(i))   .   .   .   (a/3("^). 
But  ^x^"^  vanishes  if  xi  and  X2  equal  respectively 

Thus 

Hence  if  0  vanishes  for  xi=yi''''\  X2=y2^''^  (r  =  l,  .  .  .  ,  n), 
it  is  apolar  to  f  if  and  only  if 

Thus  /  is  apolar  to  an  actual  wth  power  (y2A;i— ^1^2)"  if 
and  only  if  q:j,'*  =  0,  i.e.,  if  yi,  y2  is  a  pair  of  values  for  which 
/=0. 


§  53]  APOLARITY  79 

If  no  two  of  the  actual  linear  factors  /<  of  /  are  propor- 
tional, /  is  apolar  to  n  actual  «th  powers  //'  and  these  are  readily 
seen  to  be  linearly  independent.  Then  their  linear  combinations 
give  all  the  forms  apolar  to/.  For,  if/ is  apolar  to  <^i,  .  .  .  ,  0n, 
it  is  apolar  to  /^i<^i  +  .  .  •-\-kn4>n^  where  ^i,  ,  .  .  ,  ^a  are  con- 
stants, since,  by  (5),  §  52, 

(/,  y^i0i+.  .  .+K^nY  =  k,{J,<j>iY+.  .  .-\-knU,4>nY  =  o. 

Moreover,/  is  not  apolar  to  n-\-\  linearly  independent  forms 

01,    02,    •     •     .     ,    0n+l- 

For,  if  so,  we  have  n-\-l  equations  like  (1),  in  which  the  deter- 
minant of  the  coefficients  of  ao,  •  •  •  ,  an  is  therefore  zero. 
But  this  implies  a  linear  relation  between  the  0's.  ///  is  the 
product  of  n  distinct  linear  factors  U,  a  form  0  can  be  repre- 
sented as  a  linear  combination  of  /i",  .  .  .  ,  In^  if  afid  only  if 
0  is  apolar  to  f.  In  particular,  if  r  and  5  are  the  distinct  roots 
of  f^ax'-\-2bx-\-c  =  0,  the  only  quadratics  harmonic  to  /  are 
g{x-rY+}i{x-sY. 

In  case  h,  .  .  .  ,  Ir  are  identical,  while  li^lt{i>r),  we  may 
replace  /i",  .  .  .  ,  /r"  in  the  above  discussion  by  /i",  /i"~^X,  .  .  .  , 
l^n-r+iy-i^  whcrc  X  is  any  linear  function  of  Xi  and  x-y  which 
is  hnearly  independent  of  h.  In  fact,  after  a  linear  trans- 
formation of  variables,  we  may  set  li=X2,  \  =  Xi.  Then  the 
above  r  forms  have  the  factor  0:2""''"^^  and  hence  are  of  type 
0  with  bi  =  0{i  ^  n—r).  Also,  /  now  has  the  factor  x-z^,  so 
that  ai  =  0{i<r).     Hence  every  term  of  (l)  is  zero. 

For  example,  /=.Vi-.r-..(.Vi  — .Vi)-  is  apolar  to 

Xi^,  Xi^Vi]     .r2»;      (xi  —  x-2)\  (.fi  — .^2)^^:1, 
which  give  five  linearly  independent  quintics. 

In  general,  when  there  are  multiple  factors  of  /,  the  n 
forms  apolar  to  /  obtained  above  can  be  proved  to  be  linearly 
independent.     This  fact  is  not  presupposed  in  what  follows. 

54.  Binary  Forms  Apolar  to  Several  Given  Forms.  From 
the   list  of  the  given  forms  we  may  drop  any  one  linearly  de- 


80  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

pendent  on  the  others,  since  a  form  apolar  to  several  forms  is 
apolar  to  any  Hnear  combination  of  them.  In  the  resulting 
linearly  independent  forms 

the  g-rowed  determinants  in  the  rectangular  array  of  the 
coefficients  are  not  all  zero.  For,  if  so,  there  are  solutions 
^1,  .  .  .  T  kg,  not  all  zero,  of 

kiaii-\-k2aio-\- .  .  .-\-kgaig  =  0     {i  =  0,l,.  .  .  ,n), 

which  would  give,  contrary  to  hypothesis,  the  identity 

If  io^i"  +  .  .  .  is  apolar  to  each/r,  then 


2(-l)Y".)aJ;„_,-  =  0  (r  =  l,.  .  .  ,  g). 


These  determine  g  of  the  b's  as  linear  functions  of  the  remaining 
5's,  which  are  arbitrary.  Hence  there  are  exactly  n-\-l—g 
linearly  independent  forms  apolar  to  each  of  the  g  given 
linearly  independent  forms. 

In  particular,  apart  from  a  constant  factor,  there  is  a 
single  form  apolar  to  each  of  n  given  linearly  independent 
forms  of  order  n. 

Consider  three  binary  cubic  forms 

/i  =aJ^=aoXi^+3aixrx2-}-^a2XiX2^-\-a3X2^, 

J2  =  /Sx^  =  h(iXi^  -\-2,hxXi^X2-\-^h2XiX2'^  +h2,X2^ , 
Jz=-'yx^^CQXi^-\-ZCiXi~X2+2>C2XiX2^-{-C2X2^. 

Each  is  apolar  to  the  cubic  form 

0  =  (a/3)(a7)(i37)«:ri3^Tx. 
For,  by  (4),  §  52,  and  the  removal  of  a  constant  factor  by  (5), 

(<^,  5.-^)3  =  («i3)(a7)(/3T)(«5)(/35)(75), 
which  is  changed  in  sign  if  6  is  interchanged  with  a,  /3,  or  7,

and  hence  is  zero  if  bj^  is  one  of  the  fi.  Hence  each  /<  is  apolar 
to  4).     Now

In  fact,  the  determinant  vanishes  if  (ajS)  =  0  as  may  be  seen 
by  setting  ^i=cai,  ^2=ca2.  Moreover,  the  two  members  are 
of  total  degree  six  and  the  diagonal  term  of  the  determinant 
equals  the  product  of  the  first  terms  0:1182,  etc.,  on  the  left. 

Since  ai^ax=ai^xi-i-ai^a2X2=aoXi-{-aiX2,   etc.,   we  find,   by

Ps=/l,  PV^f2,  P^^fd, 

where  p  is  a  factor  of  proportionality  and  the  /'s  are  the  cubic 
forms  in  §  54. 

We  may  assume  that  the/'s  are  linearly  independent,  since 
otherwise  all  of  the  points  (^,  tj,  f)  would  He  on  a  straight 
line. 


82  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

There  is  a  unique  cubic  form  ^  apolar  to  /i,  /2,  /a  (§  54). 
This  cubic  form,  denoted  by  (p  =  (p/,  is  fundamental  in  the 
theory  of  the  cubic  curve. 

Three  points  determined  by  the  pairs  of  parameters  xi,  X2; 
yi,  y2',  and  z\,  so,  are  collinear  if  and  only  if 

(1)  4>x4>Az  =  ^- 

For,  if  the  three  points  he  on  the  straight  Hne 

(2)  /t  +  ;«r7  +  «r  =  0, 

the  three  pairs  of  parameters  are  pairs  of  values  for  which 

(3)  C{xi,  x-f)  ^lfi-^mf2-{-nf3  =  0. 

Since  C  is  apolar  to  (p,  (1)  follows  from  the  first  italicized  theorem 
in  §  53.  Conversely,  (1)  implies  that  the  cubic  C  which  van- 
ishes for  the  three  pairs  of  parameters  is  apolar  to  ^  and  hence 
(§  53)  is  a  linear  combination  of /i,  /2,  /s,  say  (3);  the  corre- 
sponding three  points  lie  on  the  straight  line  (2). 

Since  (2)  meets  the  curve  in  three  points  the  ratios  xi/x-z 
of  whose  parameters  are  the  roots  of  (3),  the  curve  is  of  the 
third  order. 

We  restrict  attention  to  the  case  in  which  the  actual  linear 
factors  ax,  ^x,  ix  of  4>  are  distinct.  Since  any  cubic  apolar 
to  </>  is  a  linear  combination  of  their  cubes  (§  53), 

/i  =  rna.3+Ct2/3/+c,37/  (^  =  1,  2,  3). 

Since  the  determinant  \  dj  \  is  not  zero,  suitable  linear  com- 
binations of  the/'s  give  a/,  /3x^,  jx^.  Hence  by  a  linear  trans- 
formation on  ^,  7],  f  (i.  e.,  by  choice  of  a  new  triangle  of  ref- 
erence), we  may  take  * 

The  line  ^  =  0  is  an  inflexion  tangent,  likewise  7j  =  0  and 
f  =  0.  In  addition  to  the  resulting  three  inflexion  points, 
there  are  no  others.  For,  at  an  inflexion  point  three  consecutive 
points  are  collinear,  so  that  (l)  gives  (^  =  <^/  =  0.    In  the  present 

*  We  now  have  the  formulas  in  the  second  part  of  §  54,  where  now  ax^  is  the 
actual,  not  a  symbolic,  expression  of /i,  etc. 


§56]  RATIONAL  PLANE   CUBIC  CURVE  83 

case  there  are  therefore  exactly  three  inflexion  points  and  they 
are  coHinear. 

56.  Any  Rational  Plane  Cubic  Curve  has  a  Double  Point. 

Let  Px  denote  the  point  (^,  r/,  i")  determined  by  the  pair  of 
parameters  xi,  xo.  If  the  ratios  x\/x2  and  yi/y2  are  distinct 
and  yet  Pi  coincides  with  Py,  then  Px  is  a  double  point.  For, 
any  straight  line  (2),  §  55,  through  Px  meets  the  curve  in 
only  the  three  points  whose  pairs  of  parameters  satisfy  the 
cubic  equation  (3),  and  since  two  of  these  pairs  give  the  same 
point  Px.  the  line  meets  the  curve  in  a  single  further  point. 
Hence  there  is  a  double  point  Px  =  Py  if  and  only  if  there  are 
two  distinct  ratios  xi/xo  and  yi/>'2  such  that  (l)  holds  identically 
in  Si,  22- 

Let  Q  be  the  quadratic  form  which  vanishes  for  the  pairs 
of  parameters  xi,  X2  and  yi,  yo  giving  a  double  point.  By  (1), 
and  the  first  theorem  in  §  53,  Q  is  apolar  to  <f)x~(f>z  for  Si,  Z2 
arbitrary.  Write  (f)'i^  as  a  symbolic  notation  for  <f>,  alter- 
native to  ^/.  Applying  the  argument  made  in  §  54  for  three 
cubics  to  two  quadratics,  we  see  that  the  unique  quadratic 
(apart  from  a  constant  factor)  which  is  apolar  to  both  <^^-0, 
and  (t>'x'^4>'u>  is  their  Jacobian 

/=  (<^0   )<t>x4>  X*  020   W 

Since  0  and  0'  are  equivalent  symbols,  their  interchange  must 
leave  /  unaltered.     Hence 

-^  =  2(00  )0x0  x{(t>z4>'w  —  4>'z4>tc\. 

The  quantity  in  brackets  equals  {<i><i>'){zw)  by  (l),  §  40.  Dis- 
carding the  constant  factor  \{zw),  we  may  take 

as  the  desired  quadratic  form.  This  is  the  Hessian  of  0. 
Conversely,  the  pairs  of  values  for  which  Q  vanishes  are  the 
pairs  of  parameters  of  the  unique  double  point  of  the  curve. 

57.  Rational  Space  Quartic  Curve.  Such  a  curve  is  given 
by 


84  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

where  the  four  binary  quartics  are  linearly  independent.  By 
§  54,  there  is  a  unique  quartic  0  apolar  to  each  of  the  four. 
As  in  §  55,  four  points  Px,  Py,  Pz,  Pw  on  the  curve  are  coplanar 
if  and  only  if 

Thus  0  =  0  gives  the  four  points  at  which  the  osculating  plane 
meets  the  curve  in  four  consecutive  points.  It  may  be  shown 
that  the  values  i"/*\  X2^'^^  for  which  the  Hessian  of  </>  vanishes 
give  the  four  points  i'j:^')  on  the  curve  the  tangents  at  which 
meet  the  curve  again. 

Fundamental   Systems   of    Covariants    of   Binary   Forms 

§§  58-63 

58.  Linear  Forms.  A  linear  form  otx  is  its  own  symbolic 
representation.  If  ax  =  0x,  then  (q:/3)=0.  Hence  the  only 
covariants  of  ax  are  products  of  its  powers  by  constants.  A 
fundamental  system  of  covariants  of  n  linear  forms  is  evidently 
given  by  the  forms  and  the  ln(n  —  l)  invariants  of  type  (a/3), 
where  ax  and  0x  are  two  of  the  forms. 

59.  Quadratic  Form.     A  covariant  K  of  a  single  quadratic 
may  have  no  factor  of  type  (a/S)  and  then  it  is 

ax  Px  Ifx     •    .    •     J    , 

or  may  have  the  factor  (a/S)  and  hence  the  further  factor  {a0), 
{ay){p8),  {ay)^x,  or  axl3x,  including  the  possibility  5  =  7.  In 
the  first  case,  K^{a^)^Ki,  where  A'l  is  a  covariant  to  which 
the  same  argument  may  be  applied.  Now  {a'y)^ay  if  ^1=72, 
y2=—yx.  Hence  in  the  last  three  cases,  K  has  a  factor  of 
the  type 

e  =  {a^)ay^^, 

where  ay  is  either  ax  or  a  new  mode  of  writing  (0:7),  and  similarly 
jSj  is  either  ^x  or  a  new  mode  of  writing  (/35). 

Interchanging  the  equivalent  symbols  a  and  8,  we  get 

d  -  i^a)^,a,  =  K«/3)  (a,/3,  -  /3,«.)  =  § (a^)2(y3),

by  (1),  §  40.  We  are  thus  led  to  the  first  case.  Hence  the 
fundamental  system  of  covariants  of  /  is  composed  of  /  and 
its  discriminant.

and  noting  that  a  and  /3  are  equivalent  symbols. 

60.  Theorems  on  Trans vectants.  In  the  expression  (4), 
§  52,  for  a  transvectant,  each  summand  taken  without  the 
prefixed  numerical  factor  is  called  a  term  of  the  transvectant. 
In  the  first  transvectant  (3),  §  52,  the  difference  of  the  two 
terms  is 

by  Ex.  6,  §  40,  and  is  the  negative  of  the  0th  transvectant 
(viz.,  product)  of  (a/3)  and  y^^.  The  act  of  remo\dng  a  factor 
a^  and  a  factor  jS^  from  a  product  and  multiplying  by  the 
factor  (q:/3)  is  called  a  convolution  (Faltung).  We  have  therefore 
an  illustration  of  the  following 

Lemma.  The  difference  between  any  two  terms  of  a  trans- 
vectant equals  a  sum  of  terms  each  a  term  of  a  lower  transvectant 
of  forms  obtained  by  convolution*  from  the  two  given  forms. 

Consider  the  rth  transvectant  of 

where  P  and  Q  are  products  of  determinantal  factors.  Then 
PQ  is  a  factor  of  each  term  of  the  transvectant.  Any  two 
terms  T  and  T  differ  only  as  to  the  arrangements  of  the  as 
and  the  /3's.      Hence  T'  can  be  derived  from  7  by  a  permuta- 

*  Including  the  case  of  no  convolution,  as  7^'  from  itself,  in  the  above  example. 


86  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

tion  on  the  as  and  one  on  the  /S's,  and  hence  by  successive 
interchanges  of  two  a's  and  successive  interchanges  of  two 
jS's.  Any  such  interchange  is  said  to  replace  a  term  by  an 
adjacent  term.  For  example,  the  two  terms  of  (3),  §  52, 
are  adjacent,  each  being  derived  from  the  other  by  the  inter- 
change of  a  with  /3.  Between  T  and  T'  we  may  therefore 
insert  terms  Ti,  .  .  .  ,  Tn  such  that  any  term  of  the  series 
T,  Ti,  T2,  ■  ■  '  ,  Tn,  T'  is  adjacent  to  the  one  on  either  side 
of  it.     Since 

r-r=(r-ri)+(ri-r2)+.  .  .+(r„_i-r„)+rr„-r), 

it  suffices  to  prove  the  lemma  for  adjacent  terms. 

The  interchange  of  two  a's  or  two  /3's  affects  just  two  factors 
of  a  term  of  (4),  §  52.     The  types  of  adjacent  terms  are  * 

where  /3'  and  /3"  were  interchanged.  The  difference  of  the 
last  two  terms  is  seen  to  equal  C(jS"^')a\  by  the  usual  identity. 
The  latter  is  evidently  a  term  of  the  (r  — l)th  transvectant 
of  /  and  {l3"^')4>/{^'\^\],  which  is  obtained  from  <f)  by  one 
convolution. 

The    difference    of    the    first    two    adjacent    terms    equals 
C(aW')(fi'^"),  since

as  shown  by  Laplace's  development.  The  same  relation 
follows  also  from  the  identity  just  used  by  taking  |i  =  — a"2, 
^2=  a" I.  The  resulting  difference  is  a  term  of  the  (r-2)th 
transvectant  of 

a  ^a   ^  p  iP   ^ 

which  are  derived  from  /  and  0  by  a  convolution. 

*A  pair    C(a'0')a"^,  C(a"li')a'^,  obtained    by    interchanging   a     and   a",  is

§G0]  FUNDAMENTAL  SYSTEM  OF  COVARIANTS  87 

The  LcMnma  leads  to  a  more  important  result.  By  tlie 
proof  leading  to  (4),  §  52.  the  coefficient  of  each  term  of  a 
transvectant  is  1/N,  if  .Y  is  the  number  of  terms.  Just  as 
S  =  hiTi-\-T-2)  implies  S-Ti=h(T2-Ti),  so

of  forms  obtained  by  eonvolntion  from  the  two  givefi  forms. 

Each  term  of  a  lower  transvectant  may  be  expressed,  by 
the  same  theorem,  as  the  sum  of  that  transvectant  and  terms 
of  still  lower  transvectants,  etc.  Finally,  when  we  reach  a 
0th  transvectant,  i.e.,  the  product  of  the  two  forms,  the  only 
term  is  that  product.     Hence  we  have  the  fundamental 

Theorem.  The  differ enee  between  any  transveetant  and 
any  one  of  its  terms  is  a  linear  function  of  lower  Iransvcclanls 
of  forms  obtained  by  convolution  from  the  two  given  forms. 

For  example,  from  (3),  §52,  and  the  result  preceding  the 
Lemma,  we  have

61.  Irreducible  Covariants  of  Degree  m  Found  by  Induction. 
Let 

/  =  a/  =  /3V'  =  .   .   .=X/ 

be  the  binary  ;;-ic  whose  fundamental  s}'stem  of  covariants 
is  desired.  Since  a  term  with  the  factor  (a/3)  is  of  degree  at 
least  two  in  the  coefficients  of  /,  the  only  covariants  of  degree 
unity  are  kf,  where  k  is  a  numerical  constant.  We  shall  say 
that  /  is  the  only  irreducible  covariant  of  degree  unity,  and 
that/,  A'l,  ....  /v,  form  a  complete  set  of  irreducible  covariants 
of  degrees    <m  if  every  covariant  of  degree    <;;/  is  a  poly- 


88  ALGEBRAIC   INVARIANTS 

nomial  in  f,  ...,  Ks  with  numerical  coefficients.  Given  the 
latter,  we  seek  the  irreducible  co variants  of  degree  m. 

A  covariant  of  degree  m  is  a  polynomial  in  the  (a/S)  and 
the  ax  such  that  each  term  contains  m  letters  a,  ^,  y,  .  .  .  . 
Let  Tm  be  one  of  the  terms  with  its  numerical  factor  suppressed. 
Let  a,  /3,  .  .  .  ,  K,  X  be  the  m  letters  occurring  in  Tm,  so  that 

r„  =  P(aX)«(/3X)^  .  .  .  {kXYxJ         {a-\-b  +  .  .  .+k-^l  =  n), 
where  P  involves  only  a,  /3,  .  .  .  ,  k.     Then 

r^_i=Pa.«/3/  .  .  .  K,fc 
is  a  covariant  of  degree  m—l.     Evidently  Tm  is  a  term  of 

{Tm-i,     X/)^  {r  =  n-l), 

since  it  is  obtained  by  r  =  a-\-b^.  .  .-{-k  convolutions  from 
Tm-i^x"^-     By  the  final  theorem  in  §  60, 

Tm={Tm-ljy+^^'cj{frn-ufy, 
j=0 

where  the  Cj  are  numerical  constants,  and  each  Tj^-i  is  derived 
from  r„i_i  by  convolutions  and  hence  is  a  covariant  of  degree 
m—l.  But  the  covariant  of  degree  m  was  a  linear  function 
of  the  various  Tm-  Hence  every  covariant  of  degree  m  oj  f  is 
a  linear  function  of  transvectants  {Cm-ufY  of  covariants  C^-i 
of  order  m—l  with  f.  Such  a  transvectant  is  zero  if  k>n, 
in  view  of  the  order  of/.  Moreover,  it  suffices  by  (5),  §52, 
to  employ  the  C^-i  which  are  products  of  powers  oif,Ki,.  .  .  , 
Kg.  Hence  the  covariants  of  degree  m  are  linear  functions  of 
a  finite  number  of  transvectants. 

In  the  examination  of  these  transvectants  {Cm-i,  fY,  we 
first  consider  those  with  k  =  \,  then  those  with  k  =  2,  etc.  We 
may  discard  any  {Cm-i,fY  for  which  Cm-i  has  a  factor  <t>,  of 
order  '^k,  which  is  a  product  of  powers  of  f,  Ki,  .  .  .  ,  Ks,  and 
of  degree  <m-l.  For,  if  T  is  a  term  of  (c^,/)^,  and  if  C^_i=^0, 
then  T  is  obtained  by  k  convolutions  of  0/,  and  qT  by  the  same 
k  convolutions  of  g<^/,  not  affecting  q.  Hence  qT  is  a  term  of 
{q(t>,  fY'     Hence

But  the  terms  of  the  last  sum  have  by  hypothesis  been  con- 
sidered previously,  while  the  co variants  ^  and  T  are  of  degree  * 
<m  and  hence  are  expressible  in  terms  of/,  Ki,  .  .  .  ,  Ks. 

62.  Binary  Cubic  Foim.  The  only  irreducible  co  variant  of 
degree  one  of 

was  shown  to  be  /.     The  only  covariants  of  degree  two  are 

(a^)'-a/-%-'^-'-  (r  =  0,  1,  2,3). 

This  vanishes  identically  if  r  is  odd.  If  r  =  0,  we  have  /-, 
which  is  reducible.  Hence  the  only  irreducible  covariant  of 
degree  two  is 

ia0)-a,l3,  =  (/,  f)~  =  Hessian  H  of  /. 

To  find  the  irreducible  covariants  of  degree  m=S,  we 
have  Cjn-i  =  Ii  or/-.  In  the  second  case,  C^-i  has  the  factor 
f  of  degree  <m  —  l  and  order  3^^'  (since  we  cannot  remove 
by  convolution  more  than  three  factors  from  the  second  function 
f  in  the  transvectant).  Hence  we  may  discard  Cm-i=f~-  It 
remains  to  consider  (H,  f)^\  k^l,  2.     Now 

(H,  /)  =  (a/3)2(a7)/3^7/  =  Jacobian  /  of  //  and  / 

is  irreducible,  being  of  order  and  degree  three  and  hence  not 
a  polynomial  in  /  and  H.     Next, 

{H,  jy  -  (a/3)2(a7)  (^7)7x  =  P{a^h.,  P  =  {cc0)  {ay) (fiy) . 

Interchanging  a  with  7,  we  get  P{^y)ai.  Interchanging  jS 
with  7,  we  get  P(y(x)0j.     Hence 

(F,/P  =  |F|M)7.  +  (^7K  +  (7«)/3x|=0. 

The  irreducible  covariants  of  degree  three  or  less  are  therefore 
/,  H,  J. 

To  find  those  of  degree  7;z=4,  we  have  Cm-i=P,  fB,  J, 

*  This  is  evident  for  the  factory  of  Cm-i-  Since  <f)  is  of  degree  <w— 1,  the 
term  T  of  (<^,  /)^'  involves  fewer  than  m  — 1  +  1  symbols  a,  ^,  .  .  .  ,  and  hence  is 
of  degree  <  m.

Replacing  {P8)yz  by  iy8)^s  +  il3y)8„  and  noting  that 

{amay){^yH5.'  =  {H,f)--f=0, 
we  get 

(/,/)  =  (a/3)2(a7)(75)/^.7x5/.

by  the  theorem  in  §  60.     Here  J  =  {haYax  =  {H,  f)^  =  0.     Since 
the  first  term  is  changed  in  sign  when  a  and  /3  are  interchanged, 
we  have  {J,fy  =  0. 
For  the  third  case, 

(/,  /)3  =  (M)2(a7)^x7x2,  5.3)3  =  {amay)(^8){y8y  =  D, 

an  invariant,  evidently  equal  to  {H,  H)^,  the  discriminant 
of  H.  Thus  D  is  the  discriminant  of  /  (§§8,  30)  and  is  not 
identically  zero.  Hence  D  is  the  only  irreducible  covariant 
of  degree  four. 

We  can  now  prove  by  induction  that  /,  H,  J  and  D  form 
a  complete  set  of  irreducible  covariants  of  degree  ^  ;w  ^  5.  Let 
this  be  true  for  covariants  Cm-\  of  degree  ^w  —  1.  We  may 
discard  (C^-i,  fy  if  Cm-i  has  the  factor/  or  /,  each  of  which 
is  of  order  3  ^  ^  and  of  degree  (1  or  3)  less  than  m  —  1;  and 
evidently  also  if  it  has  the  factor  D.  Hence  Cm-\=n%  e  ^  2. 
If  ^  J  2,  it  has  the  factor  E  of  order  2^k  and  degree  2<m  —  l. 
It  remains  to  consider  {E%  f)^.     If  e>2,  H^  has  the  factor 


§  61]  LAW  OF  RECIPROCITY  91 

H'  of  order  4^3  and  degree  -Kw— 1,  since  H'^  is  of  degree

{H\  /  )3  =  {hVl\,  a/)3  =  {ha)Hh'a)h\  =  {h\  (JlaY-a;)  =  0. 

Hence  /,  H,  J,  D  form  a  fundamental  system  of  covariants 
{cf.  §30). 

63.  Higher  Binary  Forms.  The  concepts  introduced  by 
Gordan  in  his  proof  of  the  liniteness  of  the  fundamental  system 
of  covariants  of  the  binary  p-ic  enabled  him  to  find  *  the 
system  of  23  forms  for  the  quintic,  the  system  of  2G  forms  for 
the  sextic,  as  well  as  to  obtain  in  a  few  lines  the  system  for 
the  cubic  (§  62)  and  the  quartic  (§  31).  Fundamental  sys- 
tems for  the  binary  forms  of  orders  7  and  8  have  been  deter- 
mined by  von  Gall.f 

Gordan's  method  yields  a  set  of  covariants  in  terms  of 
which  all  of  the  covariants  are  expressible  rationally  and 
integrally,  but  does  not  show  that  a  smaller  set  would  not 
serve  similarly.  The  method  is  supplemented  by  Cayley's 
theory  |  of  generating  functions,  which  gives  a  lower  limit 
to  the  number  of  covariants  in  a  fundamental  system. 

64.  Hermite's  Law  of  Reciprocity.  This  law  (§  27)  can  be 
made  self-evident  by  use  of  the  symbolic  notation.  Let  the 
form

so  that  each  of  the  roots  pi,     .  .  .  ,  pp  occurs  exactly  d  times 
in  each  product.     Consider  the  binary  ^-ic

66.  Concomitants    of    Ternary    Forms.     If   ui,    ii2,   uz   are 
constants, 

Uz  =  UiXi-\-U2X2+U:iX3  =  0 

represents  a  straight  line  in  the  point-coordinates  xi,  xo,  X3. 
Since  ui,  U2,  M3  determine  this  line,  they  are  called  its  line- 
coordinates.  If  we  give  fixed  values  to  xi,  X2,  X3  and  let  the 
line-coordinates  ui,  U2,  ws  take  all  sets  of  values  for  which 
Ux  =  0,  we  obtain  an  infinite  set  of  straight  lines  through  the 
point  (xi,  X2,  X3).  Thus,  for  fixed  x's,  Ux  =  0  is  the  equation 
of  the  point  (xi,  X2,  x^)  in  line-coordinates. 

Under  the  linear  transformation  T,  of  §  Go,  whose  deter- 
minant {^vO  is  not  zero,  the  line  Ux  =  0  is  replaced  by 

Ux=UiXi-{-U2X2  +  U3X3=0, 

in  which  333

94  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

The  equations  obtained  by  solving  these  define  a  linear  trans- 
formation Ti  which  expresses  wi,  U2,  us  as  linear  functions 
of  Ui,  U2,  Us  and  which  is  uniquely  determined  *  by  the 
transformation  T.  Two  sets  of  variables  Xi,  X2,  X3  and  wi,  ti2,  U3, 
transformed  in  this  manner,  are  called  contragredient. 

A  polynomial  P{c,  x,  u)  in  the  two  sets  of  contragredient 
variables  and  the  coefficients  c  of  certain  forms  Ji{x\,  X2,  xz) 
is  called  a  mixed  concomitant  of  index  \  of  the  /'s  if,  for  every 
linear  transformation  T  of  determinant  A?^0  on  xi,  X2,  X3  and 
the  above  defined  transformation  Ti  on  ui,  U2,  uz,  the  product 
of  P{c,  X,  u)  by  a''  equals  the  same  polynomial  P(C,  A',  U) 
in  the  new  variables  and  coefficients  C  of  the  forms  derived 
from  the  /'s  by  the  first  transformation.  For  example,  Ux  is 
a  concomitant  of  index  zero  of  any  set  of  forms. 

In  particular,  if  P  does  not  involve  the  w's,  it  is  a  covariant 
(or  invariant)  of  the  /'s.  If  it  involves  the  u's,  but  not  the 
re's,  it  is  called  a  contravariant  of  the  /'s. 

Since  U\=u^,  U2  =  u^,  1/3=11^,  we  see  by  the  last  formula 
in  §  65,  with  7  replaced  by  u,  that  (a^u)  behaves  like  a  contra- 
variant  of  index  unity  of  ax^,  and  also  like  one  of  ax",  ^x^. 

For  the  linear  forms  ax  and  fix,  («/3«)  has  an  actual  interpretation. 
For /=«!=  = /So:-,  where

By  equating  to  zero  this  determinant  (the  bordered  discriminant  of 
/),  we  obtain  the  line  equation  of  the  conic  /=  0. 

67.  Theorem.  Every  concomitant  oj  a  system  of  ternary  forms 
is  a  polynomial  in  Ux  and  expressions  of  the  types  ax,{a^y),  {a^u). 

*  We  have  only  to  interchange  the  rows  and  columns  in  the  matrix  of  T  and 
then  take  the  inverse  of  the  new  matrix  to  obtain  the  matrix  of  the  transforma- 
tion Ti.     Similarly,  Xu  x-i  are  contragredient  with  Ui,  Ui,  if  we  have  T,  §  40,  and

A  concomitant  of  the  forms  /<(xi,  X2,  X3)  is  evidently  a 
covariant  of  the  enlarged  system  of  forms /i  and  Ux.  We  may 
therefore  restrict  attention  to  covariants.  In  the  proof  of  the 
corresponding  theorem  for  binary  forms,  we  used  the  operator 
(1),  §  42.  Here  we  employ  an  operator  V  composed  of  six  terms 
each  a  partial  differentiation  of  the  third  order: 


V 


the    determinant   being   s>Tnbolic.     It   may   be    shown    as   in 
§  43  that 

F(^77f)"  =  «(»  +  l)(w  +  2)(|r?f)"-l. 

As  in  §  44,  the  result  of  applying  F'"  to  a  product  of  k  factors 
of  the  type  «{,  /  factors  of  the  type  /3„  and  m  factors  of  the 
type  7J-,  is  a  sum  of  terms  each  containing  k—r  factors  a^, 
l—r  factors  /3„  m—r  factors  75-,  and  r  factors  of  the  type  (a/37). 
For  the  case  of  an  invariant  /,  the  theorem  can  be  proved 
without  a  device.     In  the  notations  of  §  65,  we  have 

/U)  =  (^,f)V(a). 

Each  yl  is  a  product  of  factors  aj,  a,,  a^.  Hence  I  {A)  equals 
a  sum  of  terms  each  with  X  factors  of  the  type  a^,  X  of  t}'pe 
a„  and  X  of  type  a^.  Operate  on  each  member  of  the  equation 
with  F^.  The  left  member  becomes  a  sum  of  terms  each  a 
product  of  a  constant  and  factors  of  t}^e  (ajSy).  The  right 
member  becomes  the  product  of  7(a)  by  a  number  not  zero. 
Hence  I  equals  a  polynomial  in  the  (a^y). 
For  a  covariant  K,  we  have,  by  definition, " 

K(A,X)=(^rji)^K{a,x). 

Solving    the   equations   of   our    transformation    T   in    §  65, 
we  get 

(|77i')A'i  =a;i(7?2S''3  —  ^3^2)  +^"2(773^1  —  •71^3)  -}-X3{r]i^2  —  772ri), 


96  ALGEBRAIC  INVARIANTS 

etc.  Replacing  xi  by  y2Z3-ys^2,  X2  by  yaZi-yiSs,  and  xs  by 
yiZ2—y2Zi,  we  get 

{^vOXi^yr,z^-y^Zr„ 

{h^)X2  =  ycZ^-yiZ^, 

(^v^)X3=yiZ,-y„Zi. 

Our  relation  for  a  covariant  K  of  order  co  now  becomes 

S(product  of  factors  a^,  y^,  z^,  a,,,  .  .  .  ,  z^)  =  {^r]^Y'^''K{a,  x) . 

each  term  on  the  left  having  \+co  factors  with  the  subscript  ^, 
etc.  Apply  the  operator  V  to  the  left  member.  We  obtain 
a  sum  of  terms  with  one  determinantal  factor  (a/37),  ("i3y)  or 
{ayz)=ax,  and  with  X+co  — 1  factors  with  the  subscript  |,  etc. 
The  result  may  be  modified  so  that  the  undesired  factor  (a^y) 
shall  not  occur.  For,  it  must  have  arisen  by  applying  V  to 
a  term  with  a  factor  Hke  a^^^y^  and  hence  (by  the  formulas 
for  the  Xi)  with  a  further  factor  s,  or  z^.  Consider  therefore 
the  term  Ca^jS^y^z,  in  the  initial  result.  Then  the  term 
—  Caj|8,>\Sf  must  occur.  By  operating  on  these  with  F, 
we  get  C{a^y)Zr„  —  C(a/3s)y„  respectively,  whose  sum  equals 

CI  (/3y2K -  (ays)^,N  C(/3.a, -ax/3,) , 

as  shown  by  expanding,  according  to  the  elements  of  the  last 
row.

The  modified  result  is  therefore  a  sum  of  terms  each  with 
one  factor  of  type  (ai37)  or  ax  and  with  X+oj  — 1  factors  with 
subscript  ^,  etc. 

Applying  V  in  succession  X  +  co  times  and  modifying  the 
result  at  each  step  as  before,  we  obtain  as  a  new  left  member 
a  sum  of  terms  each  with  \-\-w  factors  of  the  types  {al3y)  and 
ax  only.  From  the  right  member  we  obtain  nK,  where  n  is 
a  number  ?^0.     Hence  the  theorem  is  proved.

polynomial  in  such  determinantal  factors;  any  co variant  as 
a  polynomial  in  them  and  factors  of  type  ax.  In  the  equation 
«x  =  0  of  a  plane,  n\,  .  .  .,  W4  are  called  plane-coordinates. 
The  mLxed  concomitants  defined  as  in  §  66  are  expressible 
in  terms  of  Ux  and  factors  hke  ax,  (a^y  d) ,  ia^yu) .  For  geometrical 
reasons,  we  extend  that  definition  of  mked  concomitants  to 
polynomials  P{c,  x,  u,  v),  where  Vi,  .  .  . ,  1)4  as  well  as  wi, .  .  . ,  W4 
are  contragredient  to  xi,  .  •  . ,  X4.'  There  may  now  occur 
the  additional  type  of  factor 

{a^Uv)  =  {ai^2  -Ot2^l) (usVi-UiV^)  +.    .    . -f- (0:3/34  -0:4183) {uiV2  -U2V1). 

These  six  combinations  of  the  w's  and  v's  are  called  the  line- 
coordinates  of  the  intersection  of  the  planes  Wx  =  0,  Vx  =  0.  For 
instance,  {a^uv)~  =  0  is  the  condition  that  this  line  of  inter- 
section shall  touch  the  quadric  surface  ax^  =  0. 

We  have  not  considered  concomitants  involving  also  a 
third  set  of  variables  wi,  .  .  • ,  w^,  contragredient  with  the  x's.
