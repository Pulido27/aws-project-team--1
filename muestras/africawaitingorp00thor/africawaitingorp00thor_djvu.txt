They  are  waiting  ev'rywhere, 
Where  the  fields  of  earth  are  fair, 
Where  the  rivers  nobly  run, 
Where  the  blossoms  seek  the  sun, 
Where  the  hills  rise,  high  and  grand, 
Looking  proudly  o'er  the  land — 
Waiting!  Waiting! 

They  are  waiting  in  the  wild, 
Sick  and  weary  and  defiled, 
And  the  Saviour's  healing  word 
They  have  never,  never  heard  j 
Ever  hungry  and  unfed, 
Left  without  the  living  Bread — 
Waiting!  Waiting! 

For  the  happy  beam  of  day 
That  shall  chase  their  gloom  away, 
For  the  news,  so  glad  and  blest, 
That  shall  set  their  heart  at  rest, 
For  the  peace  we  know  and  prize, 
And  the  hope  beyond  the  skies — 
Waiting!  Waiting! 

Yet  not  voiceless  or  alone, 
For  their  cry  to  heav'n  hath  flown, 
And  the  Master  waiteth  too, 
Waiteth,  ransomed  souls,  for  you. 
Till  the  life  devotion  sweet 
Be  outpoured  at  His  feet — 
Waiting!  Waiting!

PEEFAOB, 


The  sole  object  in  preparing  this  little  book  is  to 
call  the  attention  of  Christians  generally,  and  students 
in  particular,  to  the  problem  of  Africa's  evangelization. 
Issuing  as  it  does  from  the  British  Student  Volunteer 
Missionary  Union,  as  a  text-book  upon  Africa,  its 
scope  naturally  includes  all  Protestant  missionary 
effort.  Nothing,  however,  but  lack  of  opportunity 
for  further  study  has  caused  the  omission  of  the 
consideration  of  modern  Eomish  Missions  in  Africa. 

Though  intended  primarily  for  the  use  of  members 
of  Missionary  Bands,  Lay  Workers'  and  Helpers' 
Unions,  Watchers'  Bands,  Christian  Endeavourers, 
&c.,  it  is  hoped  that  it  will  also  prove  of  value  to  the 
Christian  public  and  to  African  Missionaries.  Nothing 
of  the  kind,  so  far  as  we  know,  is  to  be  found  in  print. 
There  is  an  abundance  of  general  works  upon  Africa, 
but  none  that  we  have  seen  solely  from  a  missionary 
standpoint. 

Excellent  works,  of  permanent  value,  have  been 
written  dealing  with  one  or  more  topics  and  parts 
of  Africa,  but  no  attempt,  we  believe,  has  yet  been 
made  to  face  the  problem  of  Africa's  evangelization 
in  this  generation.  To  illustrate  our  meaning  by 
topics,  the  works  of  Messrs.  Heawood,  Keane,  Keltie, 
and  Silva  White  upon  the  Geography,  Partition,  and 
Development  of  Africa,  are  exceedingly  useful  from 
geographical,  political,  and  commercial  points  of  view. 
In  the  same  way,  Messrs.  Keane  and  Tylor,  Dr.  Cust 
and  Mr.  Jevons  are  undoubted  authorities  upon  ethno- 
logical, philological,  and  religious  problems. 
A  2 


IV  PREFACE 

An  enormous  list  of  writers  on  various  African 
fields  might  be  mentioned,  only  a  few  of  whom  are 
referred  to  in  the  bibliography  to  follow.  On  the  Mis- 
sionary question  we  are  very  grateful  for  such  books 
as  Carlyle's  South  Africa  and  its  Mission  Fields 
(1878),  The  Church  Missionary  Atlas  (Part  I.  Africa) 
(1896),  and  The  History  of  the  Universities'  Mission 
to  Central  Africa  (1897).  Gf  general  works,  the 
E.T.S.  Handbook  of  Foreign  Missions  (1888)  ought 
soon  to  pass  through  a  revised  edition,  while  Leonard's 
Hundred  Years  of  Missions  has  a  good  deal  of  informa- 
tion. But  there  is  still  quite  a  small  collection  of 
African  books  written  on  Missions. 

The  time  has,  however,  come  for  a  broader  horizon 
to  our  view  of  Africa,  and  the  facts  as  to  the  relative 
need  of  Northern  and  Southern  Africa  will  prove,  we 
believe,  quite  new  to  many.  If,  therefore,  the  reading 
of  this  short  review  of  "  The  Problem  of  Africa's 
Evangelization,"  leads  to  a  more  general  accuracy 
in  the  scale  of  thought,  prayer,  and  operation  on  the 
part  of  Christians  generally,  and  all  Missionary 
Societies  and  Boards  in  particular,  this  work  will 
not  have  been  in  vain. 

The  plan  of  the  book  is  twofold.  First,  to  frame  a 
complete  picture  of  the  continent  as  a  whole,  and  then 
to  fill  in  the  details.  Thus  the  first  two  chapters  are 
devoted  to  geography  and  exploration,  then  to  the 
native  races,  languages,  and  religions  of  Africa.  For 
most  of  this  material,  personal  thanks  are  due  to  Mr. 
E.  Heawood  for  his  admirable  Geography  of  Africa 
(1897).  While  views  on  African  Paganism  and 
Mohammedanism  are  gathered,  after  studying  the 
subjects,  from  very  various  sources.  The  next  four 
chapters  deal  with  the  continent  as  four  mission-fields 
— Northern  Africa,  the  Sudan,  Central  and  Southern 
Africa.  The  dividing  lines  between  the  same  have 
been  somewhat  arbitrarily  chosen,  but  they  approxi- 
mately mark  the  great  racial  divisions  of  Africa  into 
Caucasian,  Negro,  and  Bantu,  while  Southern  Africa 
is  now  the  domain  of  the  European.     Lastly,  two 


PREFACE  V 

chapters  are  devoted  to  a  study  of  two  of  Africa's 
great  open  sores,  and  a  general  appeal.  Appendices 
A  and  B  are  taken  from  Surgeon-Major  Parke's 
standard  work  on  Health  in  the  Tropics,  and  from 
Canon  Edmonds'  specially  prepared  list  of  Bible 
Versions,  that  have  issued  from  the  British  and  Foreign 
Bible  House  (1837-97),  while  Appendices  C  and  D 
deal  with  West  African  and  Uganda  Mission  statistics 
somewhat  more  in  detail  than  was  possible  at  the 
end  of  chapters  IV.  and  V. 

In  conclusion,  it  is  a  pleasant  duty  to  acknowledge 
the  great  assistance  received  from  Messrs.  Arnot, 
Glenny,  Hoste,  King,  and  Taylor,  men  who  are  per- 
sonally acquainted  with  missionary  problems  in  many 
different  parts  of  Africa.  Thanks  are  also  due  to 
Bishops  Tucker,  Tugwell,  and  Oluwole,  Dr.  C.  H. 
Battersby,  Eev.  F.  Baylis,  Dr.  Gust,  Dr.  Moule,  Pastor 
Eichter  (of  Germany),  and  Mr.  Eugene  Stock,  for  their 
kind  help  and  criticisms.  Once  more  we  are  indebted 
to  many  British,  French,  German,  and  American  mis- 
sionary societies  for  sending  in  their  reports.  It  is 
only  to  be  regretted  that  up-to-date  statistics  of 
American  Missions,  especially  of  those  in  West  Africa, 
were  not  procured  in  time  for  insertion. 

With  this  exception  it  is  hoped  that  figures  given 
will  be  found  accurate  and  useful.  In  cases,  however, 
where  mistakes  are  detected,  we  shall  be  glad  to  have 
them  pointed  out. 

The  accompanying  map  has  been  specially  designed 
by  Stanford  &  Co.  to  enable  readers  to  follow  the  places 
mentioned  in  each  chapter.  Especial  attention  is  called 
to  the  spheres  of  influence,  the  religious  divisions,  the 
Mission  centres  and  stations,  and  the  Slave  Trade  and 
Liquor  Traffic  Zones  of  Prohibition.

AFRICA    WAITING. 

CHAPTER  I. 

THE   GEOGEAPHY  OP  AFKICA. 

Position  of  Africa. — Although  Africa  has  be- 
come an  island  since  the  cutting  of  the  Suez  Canal, 
yet  physically  it  stands  in  a  closer  relation  to  Asia 
than  to  Europe.  The  Eed  Sea,  which  divides  Africa 
from  Asia  on  the  north-east,  is  both  narrower  and 
shallower  than  the  Mediterranean.  Moreover,  as 
regards  climate,  it  has  much  more  in  common  with 
Asia  than  with  Europe,  owing  to  the  similar  latitude 
of  Northern  Africa  and  Southern  Asia.  Since  also 
the  equator  cuts  Africa  at  an  almost  equal  distance 
from  its  northern  and  southern  extremities,  it  is  the 
most  tropical  continent  in  the  world. 

Form  and  Surface. 

Outline. — The  continent  may  be  said  to  consist  of 
two  regularly- shaped  sections  joined  at  right  angles — 
a  northern  one  stretching  from  east  to  west,  and  a 
southern  one  stretching  from  north  to  south.  The 
Gulf  of  Guinea  on  the  west  coast  merely  occupies  the 
angle  between  these  sections,  while  the  Red  Sea 
does  not  break  the  regularity  of  the  outline  of  either 
Africa  or  Asia. 

As  there  are  no  deep  bays,  there  are  of  course  no 
large  peninsulas  ;  the  nearest  approach  to  one  is  what 

B 


AFRICA    ^vAirmo 


has  been  called  the  Eastern  '*  Horn  "  of  Africa,  which 
lies  to  the  south  of  the  Gulf  of  Aden.  Bold  capps  and 
promontories  are  nou,  however,  wanting — such  as  the 
Cape  of  Good  Hope  and  Cape  Agulhas  in  the  south, 
Cape  Guardafui  in  the  east,  Capes  Bon,  Spartel,  and 
Verd  on  the  north  and  west.  The  regularity  of  out- 
line is  further  noticeable  in  the  absence  of  large 
islands  lying  near  the  coasts.  From  the  neighbour- 
hood of  the  equator  on  the  west  coast  to  the 
Mozambique  Channel  on  the  east,  there  is  not  a  single 
island  of  any  importance  in  a  distance  of  4000  miles. 
Africa  thus  forms  a  very  compact  mass.  In  area  it  is 
only  exceeded  among  the  continents  by  Asia,  which 
contains  (with  its  islands)  over  17,000,000  square 
milec,  as  compared  with  the  11,500,000  of  Africa. 

Relief. — Africa  maintains,  as  a  continent,  a  uni- 
formly high  level.  Its  average  height,  which  is  second 
only  to  that  of  Asia,  has  been  calculated  to  be  about 
2000  feet.  Nowhere  do  we  see  extensive  plains  raised 
only  slightly  above  the  level  of  the  sea,  such  as  the 
vast  low  plains  of  Northern  Asia  or  of  the  Amazon 
Valley  in  South  America.  Almost  everywhere,  on 
penetrating  inland  from  the  coast,  a  steep  ascent  is 
soon  reached,  leading  either  over  mountain  ranges 
parallel  to  the  ooast,  or  up  a  series  of  terraced 
escarpments  to  a  high  plateau  which  fills  up  the 
greater  part  of  the  interior.  It  iC  only  where  rivers 
have  worn  channels  for  themsolver;  through  the 
higher  ground  that  the  lowlands  stretch  any  distance 
inland.  On  this  account  Africa  has  been  likened  to 
an  inverted  saucer,  though  this  comparison  holds  good 
rather  for  the  southern  half  than  for  the  continent  as  a 
whole. 

River  Systems. — The  rivers  of  Africa  may  be 
broadly  divided  into  two  classes,  on  the  one  hand  those 
which  rise  on  the  outer  edge  of  the  main  mass  of  high 
ground  and  run  directly  down  to  the  sea,  and  on  the 
other  those  which  rise  on  the  inner  side  of  the  ranges 
by  which  the  plateau  is  bounded,  and  either  find  their 
way  by  a  long  and  devious  course  to  the  sea  (which 


THE   GEOGRAPHY  OF   AFRICA 


they  often  reach  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  continent), 
or  empty  themselves  into  inland  lakes.  The  latter  are 
natm-ally  the  more  important,  and  their  combined 
basins  cover  the  greater  part  of  the  continent.  There 
are  fom*  principal  river-basins  to  the  continent,  and 
mention  here  will  be  made  of  seven. 

Beginning  with  the  Nile  (the  largest  river  of  the 
continent,  which  rolls  through  a  greater  extent  of 
country  from  source  to  mouth  than  any  other  river  in 
the  world),  we  see  that  it  traverses  30°  of  latitude 
from  south  to  north.  The  broadest  part  of  its  basin 
occurs  in  the  upper  half,  its  width  being  over  1100 
miles. 

West  of  the  Nile  basin  occurs  that  of  Lake  Chad, 
enclosed  on  all  sides  by  higher  ground,  so  that  none 
of  its  waters  ever  reach  the  sea.  When  in  flood  there 
is,  however,  an  out-flow  to  the  north-east.  Still  farther 
west  we  come  to  the  basin  of  the  Niger.  The 
principal  stream  starts  clos:,  to  the  west  coast  in  a 
northern  direction,  and  after  describing  an  enormous 
curve,  nearly  a  semicircle,  reaches  the  sea  by  a 
southerly  course.  From  the  east  comes  the  largest 
tributary,  the  Benu6,  which  has  its  source  on  the  high 
tableland  of  the  southern  section  of  the  continent. 

The  first  river  basin  of  this  high  southern  table- 
land, which  we  approach  from  the  north,  is  that  of  the 
Congo.  It  occupies  a  vast  and  nearly  circular  area  in 
West  Central  Africa,  and  in  every  respect,  except 
its  mere  length,  is  the  most  important  of  all.  Its 
general  slope  is  from  east  to  west,  touching  on  the 
north  each  of  the  three  basins  already  mentioned.  In 
the  upper  part  of  its  course,  however,  most  of  its 
tributaries  flow  into  what  appears  to  be  the  drying- 
up  bed  of  an  ancient  inland  sea.  The  combined 
waters  of  this  vast  area  finally  break  through  the 
western  rim  of  the  continent  by  a  narrow  passage,  in 
which  the  stream  is  constantly  broken  by  rapids  and 
cataracts,  to  become  placid  once  more  when  only  a 
short  distance  from  the  sea. 

South  of  the  Congo  basin  we  eome  to  that  of  the 
b2 


AFRICA    WAITING 


Zambesi^  which  stretches  almost  across  the  whole 
width  of  the  continent,  but  in  exactly  the  reverse 
direction  to  the  Congo,  flowing  as  it  does  from  west 
to  east.  The  water-partings  on  the  side  of  the  Congo, 
though  at  a  considerable  elevation,  are  hardly  dis- 
tinguishable, so  level  is  the  country;  while  on  the 
south  its  streams  actually  interlace  with  those  con- 
nected with  Lake  Ngami,  the  direction  of  some  of 
them  varying  with  the  time  of  year.  This  river 
has,  like  the  Congo,  to  break  through  the  rim  of  the 
continent  before  reaching  the  sea,  and  there  receives, 
close  to  the  east  coast,  a  most  important  tributary, 
the  Shir6,  which  flows  from  the  great  Lake  Nyasa. 

The  two  remaining  rivers  that  occupy  South  Africa 
are  of  much  smaller  size,  and  need  only  a  passing 
mention.  The  Limpo;po  and  the  Orange  rivers  have 
courses  exactly  opposite  to  each  other,  and  flow  into 
the  sea  in  an  easterly  and  westerly  direction  respec- 
tively, and  they  both  form  natural  boundaries  to  the 
countries  between  which  they  flow. 

A  description  of  the  great  lakes  of  East  Africa  has 
been  reserved  for  a  later  place. 

Climate^  Flora,  and  Fauna, 

Climate  depends  chiefly  on  temperature,  prevailing 
winds,  and  rainfall.  These  in  their  turn  determine 
vegetation,  and  the  distribution  of  animal  Hfe,  on 
which,  together  with  climate,  depends  in  a  great 
measure  the  distribution  of  populations. 

1.  Temperature. — Though  Africa  is  the  most 
tropical  continent,  it  has  a  great  variety  of  tempera- 
tures. In  general,  a  clear  distinction  must  be  drawn 
between  those  of  Northern  and  Southern  Africa; 
for  from  its  position  and  shape  the  northern  half 
is  much  more  subject  to  continental  heat  than  the 
southern  section.  In  particular,  along  the  coast  of 
the  Mediterranean  and  in  the  greater  part  of  South 
Africa  the  actual  mean  temperature  ranges  from  72° 
to  under  64°  Fahrenheit;  while  within  the  tropics 
the    temperature    of    Africa    south  of  the  northern 


THE  GEOGRAPHY  OF  AFRICA 


deserts  is  low  considering  the  latitude,  this  being 
principally  due  to  the  great  average  elevation.  On 
the  higher  plateau,  in  fact,  the  cUmate  is  often  really 
cold;  but  along  the  coasts  of  East  Africa  and  the 
Gulf  of  Guinea,  including  vast  regions  in  West  and 
East  Sudan,  the  mean  annual  temperature  exceeds  80° 
Fahrenheit. 

2.  Prevailing  Winds. — We  can  only  speak  approxi- 
mately of  winds  in  regions  other  than  North  and  South 
Africa  and  on  the  Eed  Sea  coast,  for  of  those  in  the 
interior  next  to  nothing  is  known.  In  the  southern 
hemisphere  the  S.E.  trade  winds  prevail  off  the  west  and 
south-east  coasts ;  but  in  the  northern  hemisphere  the 
N.E.  trades  are  only  constant  off  the  Atlantic  shores. 
Besides  these  the  Gulf  of  Guinea  enjoys  the  S.W. 
monsoon  most  of  the  year,  except  during  the  calms ;  and 
the  East  Coast,  affected  by  Asia,  receives  southerly  to 
north-easterly  winds  according  to  the  time  of  year. 
Along  the  Eed  Sea,  however,  the  wind  blows  almost 
always  from  the  north. 

3.  Rainfall. — The  distribution  of  rain  is  due  princi- 
pally to  the  prevailing  winds,  and  these  again  are 
very  largely  influenced  by  the  distribution  of  land  and 
water,  and  the  general  configuration  of  the  country. 
Now  as  Northern  Africa  and  South- West  Asia  form 
part  of  one  climatic  region,  the  former  loses  much  of 
the  influence  of  sea-breezes,  and  has  a  correspondingly 
small  rainfall ;  hence  its  desert  character.  But  as  soon 
as  the  eastern  "horn"  is  passed,  we  find  almost 
everywhere  a  rainfall  of  over  ten  inches  a  year.  The 
equatorial  regions  receive  the  greatest  rainfall,  varying 
generally  from  25  to  100  inches  a  year.  Among  these. 
Sierra  Leone  and  the  Niger  Delta  seem  to  be  the  most 
numid  regions  of  all,  for  even  an  average  of  100  inches 
is  exceeded  there ;  this  is  mainly  the  cause  of  their 
great  unhealthinesa. 

4.  The  Seasons  and  their  effect  on  Health. — 
Near  the  equator  there  are  two  rainy  seasons,  extend- 
ing from  April  to  November,  separated  by  a  short  dry 
one.  but  as  the  distance  from  the  equator  increases^ 


AFRICA    WAITING 


only  one  rainy  season  is  found,  the  remainder  of  the 
year  being  continuously  dry.  The  worst  times  of  the 
year  for  health  are  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  rainy 
seasons. 

The  Mediterranean  seaboard  and  the  coasts  of  South 
Africa,  which  belong  to  the  temperate  zone,  receive 
all  their  rain  in  the  winter  months,  while  snowfalls 
may  occur  in  the  most  elevated  regions  of  both. 
Even  at  the  equator  snow  falls  above  a  certain  altitude ; 
and  it  has  been  ascertained  that  Mounts  Kilima-Njaro, 
Kenia  and  Euwenzori,  at  any  rate,  thrust  their  crests 
above  the  line  of  perennial  snow. 

Types  of  Vegetation. — In  this  respect  also  we 
naturally  find  great  contrasts  in  Africa.  Thus  the  tem- 
perate regions  possess  special  flora  quite  different  from 
that  of  the  tropical  portion  of  the  continent.  The  flora 
of  the  south  consists  largely  of  shrubs  and  bushes,  the 
most  characteristic  order  of  plants  being  a  variety  of 
heaths.  In  the  desert  regions,  especially  in  the  north, 
the  growth  of  plants  is  limited,  but  species  of  mimosa 
and  acacia  are  particularly  abundant  in  all  the  dry 
parts  of  the  continent. 

Great  varieties  of  vegetation  are  to  be  observed  also 
within  the  tropics. 

1.  There  are  the  true  tropical  forests ,  so  graphically 
described  to  us  by  Stanley,  matted  together  with  creepers 
and  choked  with  dense  undergrowth ;  these  forest 
regions  are  found  principally  on  or  near  the  equator, 
where  there  is  no  lengthened  dry  season,  and  in  general 
-on  the  western  side  of  the  continent.  It  is  in  regions 
like  the  Congo  basin  and  the  coast  land  of  the  Gulf  of 
Guinea,  that  we  find  the  most  extensive  and  unbroken 
forests,  which,  though  hardly  attaining  to  the  rich 
luxuriance  of  those  of  South  America,  still  cover 
very  large  areas.  This  western  region  is  also  the 
chief  home  of  the  oil  and  wine  palm,  which  are  of  con- 
siderable value. 

2.  Then  come  the  wide  grassy  expanses,  either  with 
or  without  trees ;  this  grass  often  attains  a  height 
imknown  in  temperate  climates. 


THE  GEOGRAPHY  OF  AFRICA 


3.  Most  characteristic  perhaps,  of  Africa  as  a  whole, 
are  the  tree  savannahs,  in  which  grassy  expanses 
are  dotted  over  with  trees,  either  singly  or  r .  small 
patches,  giving  the  country  a  park-like  appearance. 
The  grass  here  is,  as  a  rule,  burnt  do\/n  annually  by 
the  natives,  in  order  that  a  fresh  and  tender  crop  may 
spring  up  in  its  place.  These  annual  grr^ss-burnings 
have  doubtless  done  much  in  the  past  to  limit  the 
extent  of  forests. 

4.  Also  grassy  steppes  extend  in  East  Africa  for  miles, 
forming  grazing  ground  for  cattle  and  for  vast  herds 
of  wild  animals. 

5.  Other  types  of  vegetation  are  those  of  the  moun- 
tain regions  in  Hast  Africa  and  Abyssinirj,  which  are 
very  similar,  and  the  swampy  regions  of  lake  margins 
and  r.trcams,  such  as  the  Upper  Nile. 

Some  of  the  mor/j  useful  plants  fov.:".c-  in  Africa  in  a 
wild  state  may  here  be  enumerryiecL  The  '  ief  of 
them  are — in  the  dry  regions  o:  the  lorth,  tne  date- 
palm,  esparto  grass,  or  alfa  (ucied  for  making  pa^er), 
and  various  gum-acacias  and  aromatic  plr  nts ;  in  the 
moist  forest  regions,  the  oll-nrAmj  orchilla  woed  (used 
as  a  dye) ,  and  numerous  creepG3'S  yielding  india-rubber; 
in  other  p:  r 's  of  Tropical  Aiiiccy,  the  cotton  plant  and 
coffee  shrub,  the  kola;  nut  and  gum  copal  tree.  Some 
of  the  plants  which  -vjc  .vegubjrly  cultivated  will  be 
noticed  in  speaking  ol  tho  occupations  o:'  the  people. 

African  Fauna. — AnimrAs  are  mostly  migratory, 
and  in  Equatorial  /..'licrj  this  movement  seems  to 
have  been  from  north  to  south.  The  most  ancient 
faunal  types,  which  exist  nowhere  else,  are  the 
hippopotamus  and  the  giraffe.  Among  the  larger 
animals  are  the  elephant,  found  almost  everywhere 
south  of  the  desert  regions,  and  the  antelope,  of 
which  there  is  an  extraordinary  number  of  species. 
Other  characteristic  animals  are  the  lion,  and 
leopard  (though  not  the  tiger),  hyaena,  jackal,  &c. ; 
the  Cape  buffalo,  the  zebra,  and  the  wild  ass  of  Abys- 
sinia; the  fierce  gorilla  and  the  chimpanzee  in  western 
regions,  and  monkeys  throughout  the  continent.     The 


8  AFRICA    WAITING 


camel,  imported  from  Asia,  and  now  found  all  over  the 
Sahara,  must  not  be  forgotten. 

There  are  many  kinds  of  reptiles,  such  as  the 
crocodile,  viper,  and  puff-adder ;  while  the  ostrich,  the 
largest  of  existing  birds,  roams  over  the  more  arid 
regions.  Of  insect  life  there  is  an  extraordinary 
abundance.  Amongst  these  locusts  are  seriously 
dreaded  in  the  north,  while  the  tsetse-fly  is  a  deadly 
enemy  in  Southern  Africa ;  its  bite  causes  the  death 
of  horses,  oxen,  camels,  sheep,  and  dogs  ;  but,  curiously 
enough,  it  is  innocuous  to  man,  as  also  to  buffaloes, 
zebras,  goats,  jackals,  hyaenas,  and  several  other  wild 
animals. 

Periods  of  Exploration. 

Relation  with  other  Continents. — Very  little  is 
known  of  Africa's  history  in  the  remote  past,  but 
within  historic  times  it  has  been  modified  by  contact 
with  peoples  from  without.  The  strip  of  country  lying 
along  the  northern  coast  of  Africa  has  always  been  in 
touch  with  Europe  and  Western  Asia,  but  we  see  at  once 
that  the  great  desert  of  Sahara  formed  an  obstacle  to  the 
extension  of  outside  influence.  It  is  only  since  the  Arab 
introduction  of  the  camel  that  this  insuperable  barrier  to 
progress  has  been  crossed.  On  turning  eastward,  how- 
ever, we  find  that  Eastern  Africa  was  long  ago  closely 
connected  with  the  Arab  power,  which  had  its  centre 
in  South-West  Arabia,  where  Aden  now  stands,  and  an 
extensive  trade  was  carried  on  with  most  of  the 
countries  bordering  the  Indian  Ocean.  Evidence  of 
this  remains  in  ancient  buildings  on  the  east  coast,  and 
of  commerce  still  older  in  a  gold-mining  district  of 
South-East  Africa.  A  similar  political  connexion  in 
later  times  was  that  between  Zanzibar  and  the  Sultans 
of  Muscat  (for  the  last  two  centuries),  until  in  our  own 
day  the  trade  has  fallen  increasingly  into  the  hands  of 
natives  of  India,  from  amongst  whom  also  the  police 
forces  of  British  Tropical  Africa  are  now  largely 
recruited. 

Isolation  of  Central  Africa. — The  fact  remains 


THE  GEOGRAPHY  OF  AFRICA 


that  the  whole  centre  of  the  continent  had,  until  the  nine- 
teenth century,  hardly  any  deahngs  with  the  outside 
world  as  known  to  history.  Several  causes  have  brought 
about  this  isolation.  The  roundness  of  outline,  the  want 
of  access  from  the  sea  by  navigable  rivers,  the  unhealthi- 
ness  of  the  coast-lands,  and  the  want  of  political  status 
of  Africa — all  these  causes  have  not  been  favourable  to 
intercourse  with  outsiders.  And  even  when  reached, 
the  only  staple  products  of  the  continent  have  consisted 
in  gold,  ivory,  and  slaves,  none  of  them,  when  brought 
to  the  coast,  being  of  so  much  importance  as  the  spices, 
silks,  and  muslins  of  the  Far  East,  or  the  precious 
metals  and  plantation  products  of  America. 

Epochs  of  Discovery. — We  may  fairly  lay  down 
six  epochs  as  marking  stages  in  the  history  and 
development  of  Africa. 

1.  Tine,  Knowledge  of  the  Ancients,  so  far  as  ancient 
Egypt  was  concerned,  probably  extended  to  the  lower 
Nile  valley,  and  the  coasts  of  the  Eed  Sea.  They 
may  have  reached  the  shores  of  the  Indian  Ocean 
beyond ;  in  fact,  a  Phenician  vessel  is  mentioned  by 
Herodotus  as  having  circumnavigated  Africa,  and  it 
may  be  true.  Carthaginians  not  only  settled  along 
the  Mediterranean  coast,  but  probably  reached  the 
Gulf  of  Guinea.  Greeks  and  Eomans  show  by  their 
writings  some  knowledge  of  the  interior  and  its  races ; 
while  an  expedition  sent  by  Nero  seems  to  have  reached 
a  point  very  far  up  the  Nile.  Later  on  mention  is 
made  of  the  Nile  lakes  and  the  famous  Mountains  of 
the  Moon,  now  identified  with  the  equatorial  snow 
mountains  ;  they  certainly  figured  on  most  of  the  maps 
of  olden  days. 

2.  Arab  Discoveries,  due  to  extension  of  Arab  in- 
fluence over  most  of  Northern  Africa,  (while  a  hindrance 
to  European  intercourse  with  the  central  regions) 
enlarged  the  bounds  of  knowledge.  Trade  also  was 
promoted  with  the  countries  south  of  the  Sahara. 
The  writings  of  Arab  historians  and  geographers, 
between  the  tenth  and  sixteenth  centuries,  were  the 
first  to  supply  us  with  any  definite  information. 


to  AFRICA    WAITING 


3.  Portuguese  Voyages  of  the  fifteenth  century,  as 
dkected  by  Prince  Henry  of  Portugal,  have  led  to  all 
modern  discovery.  His  is  a  name  that  will  stand  high 
among  those  v^ho  have  done  good  work  for  the  world. 
Intent  on  opening  up  a  sea-route  round  Africa  to  the 
East,  Prince  Henry  despatched  expedition  after  expe- 
dition with  admirable  method  and  stedfastness,  each 
extending  by  a  little  the  bounds  of  knowledge  on  the 
West  Coast.  His  death  in  1460  did  not  damp  the 
ardour  of  his  followers  in  the  work  begun,  for 
Bartholomew  Diaz  doubled  the  Cape  in  1487,  and 
Vasco  da  Gama  reached  India  in  1498.  Meanwhile, 
the  kingdom  of  Congo  came  under  Portuguese  influence, 
and  the  successors  of  Da  Gama  established  forts  and 
settlements  along  the  whole  East  Coast  of  Africa. 

4.  European  Coast  Settler)ients. — It  was  not  long 
before  other  European  nations — the  British,  French, 
Dutch,  and  Danes — began  to  frequent  the  coasts  of 
Guinea  in  quest  of  gold  and  slaves.  Besides  this, 
many  attempts  were  made  by  way  of  the  Senegal  and 
Gambia  to  reach  the  city  of  Timbuctu,  of  which  the 
Arab  vnriters  had  said  so  much.  This  part  of  the 
coast  was  preferred  to  others  as  a  starting  point,  from 
a  belief  that  the  Niger  flowed  westwards  to  the  sea. 
And  further  the  site  of  Cape  Town,  off  Table  Bay, 
which  was  discovered  by  Saldanha  in  1507,  was  per- 
manently occupied  by  the  Dutch  in  1652.  This  little 
settlement  expanded  into  a  small  agricultural  colony, 
and,  when  reinforced  by  French  Huguenots  and  other 
Protestant  refugees  after  the  revocation  of  the  Edict  of 
Nantes,  it  became  the  centre  from  which  the  explora- 
tion of  Southern  Africa  was  to  begin. 

5.  Exploration  of  the  Interior  will  be  treated  of 
successively  in  later  chapters.  The  opening  of  the 
heart  of  Africa  has  been  the  work  of  the  last  hundred 
years,  till  now  the  Niger  and  Sudan,  the  Nile  and  the 
Great  Lakes,  the  Zambesi  and  the  Congo,  are  all  ex- 
plored. Only  in  the  present  day  has  the  whole  conti- 
nent been  laid  bare  to  our  view,  and  none  have  helped 
to  open  it  so  widely  as  David  Livingstone.     Previous 


fiiE  GEOGRAPHY  OF  AFRICA  11 

to  his  time  our  knowledge  of  this  vast  region  has  been 
quaintly  thus  described  by  Dean  Swift : — 

"  Geographers  in  Afric's  maps 
Put  savage  beasts  to  fill  up  gaps, 
And  o'er  inhabitable  downs 
Put  elephants  for  want  of  towns." 

6.  Modern  Partition  of  Africa. — The  Brussels  Con- 
ference of  1884,  between  the  Powers  of  Europe, 
authorized  various  European  nations  to  assume  pro- 
tection over  nearly  all  the  continent.  During  the  past 
few  years  annexations  have  proceeded  apace  in  all 
directions,  until,  with  the  doubtful  exception  of  Abys- 
sinia, the  only  native  dominionc  of  any  importance  are 
those  of  the  Mahdists  in  the  Eastern,  and  of  Wadai  in 
the  Central  Sudan.  If,  therefore,  Europe  gives  her 
best  to  Africa,  the  day  of  Africa's  redemption  is  already 
dawning. 


CHAPTEE  II. 

NATIVE  RACES,   LANGUAGES,   AND  RELIGIONS. 

Dr.  Frederick  Max  Mtiller  has  said:  "My  tkree 
favourite  studies  are  the  Science  of  Langr.age,  the 
Science  of  Thought,  and  the  Science  of  Eehgion." 
No  continent  in  the  world  possesses  a  more  varied 
field  of  observation  for  the  study  of  race  and  lar^f^uage 
and  religion  than  Africa.  For  hither  the  ethnologist 
can  trace  the  wanderings  of  the  sons  of  Shem  and  Ham 
and  Japheth.  The  widest  scope  for  research  can  be 
given  to  the  linguist,  while  Paganism,  Mohammedan- 
ism, and  Christianity  in  all  its  forms  are  represented. 

African  Baces, 

The  contrast  between  North  and  South  Africa,  as 
observed  in  our  last  chapter,  is  still  very  marked, 
when  we  look  at  the  various  races  which  people 
the  continent;  and  the  boundary  line  between  the 
two  corresponds  very  well  with  the  climatic  line  of 
division.  The  Northern  and  the  Southern  Africans 
belong  respectively  to  two  out  of  the  three  main 
groups  into  which  the  human  race  has  been  divided, 
the  North  Africans  forming  part  of  the  so-called 
White,  Caucasian,  or  Mediterranean  type,  while  the 
latter  belong  to  what  has  been  styled  the  Ethiopic  or 
Black  type.  In  other  respects,  they  may  be  briefly 
described  as  follows  : — the  Northern  have  broad  skulls, 
straight  noses  with  a  high  bridge,  thinnish  lips,  and 
somewhat  curly  hair ;  while  the  Southern  have 
narrow  skulls  (long  in  comparison  from  front  to  back). 


13 

broad,  flat  noses,  thick  lips,  woolly  hair,  high  cheek- 
bones— and,  in  particular,  projecting  jaws.  There  are 
exceptions,  of  course,  especially  where  an  admixture 
has  taken  place  in  the  past. 

When  further  divided,  the  Northern  races  fall 
under  two  main  divisions  of  the  Mediterranean  race, 
generally  known  as  Semitic  and  Hamitic.  But  except 
for  certain  broad  differences  of  feature  and  forms  of 
speech,  the  two  races  are  much  mixed  up.'  The 
Southern  races  consist  mainly  of  two  branches  of  the 
black  or  Negro  race,  commonly  known  nowadays  as 
"  Sudan  Negroes  "  and  '*  Bantu  tribes."  In  various 
parts  of  the  Bantu  domain,  scattered  tribes  of  small 
stature  (called  dwarfs  or  pygmies)  have  been  recently 
met  with,  while  in  the  south-west  of  the  continent  we 
find  other  tribes  totally  distinct  from  the  Bantus, 
which  are  classed  as  Hottentots  and  Bushmen. 
And  yet  a  sixth  division  is  given  by  Dr.  F.  Miiller 
of  Vienna,  called  the  Fulah-Nuba  race,  but  more  will 
be  said  under  languages  of  this  interesting  group. 

Their  Manners  and  Customs. — The  occupations 
of  these  races  are  threefold.  The  Semitic  and  Ha- 
mitic races  dwell  principally  in  regions  of  the  north 
and  north-east,  which  just  afford  pasturage  for  flocks 
or  for  cattle.  They  are  mainly  pastoral,  possessing 
nomadic  habits  due  to  wandering  in  search  of  pasture. 
Their  flocks,  too,  vary  in  difl'erent  regions  according 
to  the  dryness  of  the  climate,  the  camel  alone  being 
able  to  subsist  in  the  most  arid  regions  of  all.  The 
Negro  race  generally  practises  agriculture,  often  to  the 
entire  exclusion  of  cattle-rearing,  especially  in  the 
moist  and  warm  regions  of  West  Africa  ;  the  Negroes 
therefore,  as  a  rule,  are  more  stationary  in  their 
habits.  In  the  south  of  their  domain,  however,  the 
nature  of  the  country  gives  more  importance  again  to 
cattle-rearing.  In  many  parts  where  the  Northern 
races  have  encroached  on  the  domain  of  the  Negro, 
the  ruHng  (Hamitic)  race  is  devoted  to  cattle-rearing, 

»  Cf .  Chapter  III. 


14  AFRICA    WAITING 


and  the  subject  Negroes  to  agriculture.  The  mode  of 
life  of  the  races  of  small  stature  differs  from  both 
of  the  above  types.  These  tribes  are  of  nomadic 
habits,  wandering  about  in  search  of  game,  which 
they  kill  with  poisoned  arrows. 

Trade  has  been  carried  on  for  many  centuries  in 
North  x\frica,  across  the  desert,  for  the  interchange 
of  the  products  of  the  countries  to  the  north  and  south 
of  that  region,  and  the  export  of  its  main  products, 
dates,  salt,  and  indigo  dye.  Goods  are  carried  by 
long  strings  of  camels,  known  as  caravans,  by  the 
help  of  which  alone  the  desert  can  be  crossed.  In  the 
Negro  domain,  commerce  has  been  in  a  very  backward 
state  until  recent  years,  although  it  is  supposed  by 
some  that  ivory  has  been  exported  from  Central 
Africa  to  the  east  coast  since  early  times.  Means 
of  inter-communication  hrjve  been  almost  entirely 
wanting,  as  there  are  no  roads,  but  only  narrow,  wind- 
ing foot-paths,  connecting  the  villages,  and  forming,  in 
parts,  frequented  routes  for  longer  distances,  along 
which  goods  can  only  be  transported  on  men's  heads. 

Industries  are  few,  and  hardly  supply  any  articles 
of  commerce.  In  Northern  Africa,  goat's  hair  is 
woven  into  cloth,  both  for  clothing  and  for  tents.  In  the 
southern  half  of  the  continent,  iron  is  worked  where- 
ever  present,  and  iron  implements  often  form  objects 
of  barter.  The  Negro,  however,  is  not  inventive, 
though  he  readily  imitates.  He  shows  a  great  deal  of 
skill  in  the  simpler  handicrafts,  such  as  basket-work, 
weaving,  and  the  making  of  wooden  utensils. 

Political,  Social,  and  Religious  Life. — In  no 
continent  is  there  less  tendency  to  the  formation 
of  states  than  in  Africa.  This  is  chiefly  due  to  the 
nature  of  the  Negro  race,  which  shows,  perhaps,  less 
aptitude  for  political  combination  than  any  other 
people.  The  Northern  races,  who  undoubtedly  stand 
on  a  higher  level  of  culture  than  the  Negro,  show 
a  much  greater  disposition  to  the  formation  of  states, 
which  are  therefore  found  on  both  sides  of  the  desert 
zone,  where  the  possibility  of  cultivation  gives  a  greater 


NATIVE  RACES,    LANGUAGES,    AND   RELIGIONS        1 5 

fixity  to  the  population.  In  the  desert  itself  the 
pastoral  hfe  of  the  inhabitants,  with  the  nomadic 
habits  which  it  induces,  tends  rather  to  the  formation 
of  numerous  family  groups  or  clans  under  patriarchal 
rule,  these  being  occasionally  combined  over  a  large 
area  to  form  a  sort  of  political  confederation.  In 
the  southern  half  of  Africa  there  hardly  exists  a  really 
important  kingdom,  and  where  such  has  been  formed 
it  has  never  been  of  long  duration.  Instead  of  power- 
ful kings,  we  find  only  innumerable  petty  chiefs,  whose 
authority,  in  many  cases,  is  restricted  to  a  single  village; 
a  general  state  of  mutual  distrust  is  the  result,  and 
feuds  are  perpetually  kept  up  between  neighbouring 
tribes  and  villages.  This  state  of  things  is  one  of  the 
greatest  obstacles  to  progress  and  civiHzation.  It  has 
been  largely  encouraged  by  the  slave  trade,  which  has 
been  the  scourge  of  Africa  for  centuries. 

The  domestic  life  of  the  Negroes  is  primitive,  and 
the  bonds  of  family  relationship  are  very  strong. 
There  is  great  affection  shown  between  parents  and 
children,  but  the  prevalence  of  polygamy,  especially 
among  the  chiefs,  leads  to  endless  discords  and  other 
evils.  Cannibalism  is  still  prevalent  in  certain  parts, 
having  been  originally  connected  in  most  cases  with 
rehgious  rites. 

The  Northern  races,  with  hardly  an  exception, 
profess  the  religion  of  Mohammed,  and  many  tribes 
have  the  name  of  being  religious  fanatics.  The  re- 
ligious ideas  of  the  Negroes  are  very  primitive. ^  Where 
they  have  come  in  contact  with  Northern  races,  they 
have  to  a  large  extent  become  nominally  converted  to 
Islam,  which  has  of  late  years  rapidly  extended  its 
influence  southwards;  little,  however,  is  understood 
of  the  doctrines  of  that  religion  by  the  so-called 
converts.  Much  more  is  being  done  towards  elevating 
the  Negroes  by  the  missionaries  of  the  various  Christian 
communions,  who  of  late  years  have  met  with  con- 
siderable success  in  their  work.

and  statisticians  differ  enormously  as  to  the  total 
number  of  the  inhabitants  of  Africa.  One  considers 
the  numbei-  as  low  as  127  millions,  and  others  reckon 
the  population  to  be  about  200  millions,  but  numbers 
given  for  the  Sudan  and  for  Central  Africa  are  little  more 
than  guesses,  and  even  in  better  known  parts  there 
is  great  uncertainty.  It  can  only  be  generally  stated 
that  the  Sudan  is  the  most  thickly  populated  part,  and 
the  Sahara  has  fewest  inhabitants. 

Approximate  tables  are,  however,  given  at  the  end 
of  Chapters  III.,  IV.,  V.,  VI. 

African  Languages. 

There  have  been  so  few  philologists  at  work  among 
African  languages  that  the  classification  of  languages 
and  of  dialects  has  only  just  begun. 

1.  The  Hamitic  Family  of  languages  consists  of 
three  groups: — 

{a)  Egyptian,  the  ancient  language  of  Egypt  and  of 
Moses,  with  records  on  stone  that  date  as  far  back  as 
4000  years  before  the  Christian  era.  Under  Greco- 
Christian  influences  this  passed  into  Coptic,  which  has 
survived  in  ecclesiastical  use  in  the  Coptic  Church. 

(h)  Libyan,  or  Berber,  comprises  the  indigenous 
vernaculars  of  North  Africa  prior  to  the  Arab  invasion, 
and  is  still  used  by  the  Berbers  and  Tuaregs.  This 
group  undoubtedly  represents  the  ancient  language  of 
Mauretania  and  Numidia,  and  later  on  it  was  used  by 
Augustine  in  preaching.  It  ranks,  therefore,  among 
the  most  venerable  of  human  tongues. 

(c)  Ethiopic  is  strangely  intermixed  with  other 
dialects  in  and  around  Abyssinia.  In  this  group  are 
found  the  languages  of  the  Somali  and  Galla  nations 
in  the  Eastern  Horn,  also  of  the  Bisharin,  Falashas, 
and  Agau. 

2.  The  Semitic  Family,  of  which  there  are  two 
branches  in  Africa,  (a)  The  languages  of  Abyssinia, 
especially  Amharic  and  Tigr6.  These  are  derived 
from  the  ancient  Geez  of  Southern  Arabia,  which  is 


KATIVE  RACES^    LANGUAGES,   AND   RELIGIONS       1 7 

still  the  liturgical  language  of  the  Abyssinian  Chris- 
tians, (h)  Arabic,  rightly  called  one  of  the  conquering 
languages  of  the  world.  "It  is  the  vehicle  of  thought 
over  the  greater  part  of  Africa,  and  the  instrument  of 
the  spread  of  Islam  throughout  Northern  Africa." 
Kabyle,  Kaffir,  and  Swahili  are  Arab  names  [in 
north  and  south  and  east,  which  will  long  be 
remembered. 

3.  The  Fulah  and  Nuba  Groups,  occupying  a 
position  midway  between  the  Hamite  and  the  Negro. 
As  Arabic  is  the  language  of  religion,  so  Fulah  is  the 
language  of  empire.  Pure  Nubians  now  inhabit  the 
Nile  valley,  having  most  likely  immigrated  from  the 
west  between  the  time  of  Herodotus  and  that  of 
Eratosthenes.  Both  these  nations  are  dominant  races, 
superior  in  power  and  culture  to  lower  Pagan  peoples. 
They  are  also  bigoted  Moslems. 

4.  The  Negro  Systems. — The  Negro  and  the 
Bushman  probably  share  the  honour  of  being  the 
original  inhabitants  of  Africa.  Certainly  the  Negro 
type  appears  distinctly  on  the  monuments  of  Egypt 
5000  years  ago.  There  are  three  great  Negro  dwelling 
places  :  {a)  the  western  coast,  {b)  the  basin  of  the  Chad, 
(c)  the  Upper  Nile.  The  pure  Negro  lives,  however, 
in  the  western  half  of  the  Sudan.  Their  population 
is  estimated  at  from  sixty  to  a  hundred  millions,  and 
their  distinct  languages  amount  to  about  200,  in 
addition  to  innumerable  dialects.  Among  the  number 
of  isolated  languages,  Hausa  is  the  most  widely  spoken, 
and  it  is  now  the  commercial  language  of  the  whole 
Sudan.  It  has  several  points  in  common  with  all  the 
above  four  groups,  and  therefore  holds  a  unique 
position  in  Northern  Africa. 

5.  The  Bantu  Family. — To  Dr.  Krapf  is  due  the 
merit  of  the  discovery  that  a  single  family  of  languages 
prevailed  south  of  the  equator  throughout  Africa. 
"The  term  Bantu  is  a  linguistic  rather  than  an 
ethnical  expression.  The  now  extinct  organic  Bantu 
language  was  of  the  Negro  type,  but  developed  along 
peculiar  lines."     Its  chief  feature  consists  in  the  use 


1 8  AFRICA    WAITING 


of  prefixes  instead  of  affixes,  e.g.  '*  aba-ntu  aba-kulu," 
or  *'  great  men,"  as  compared  with  the  Latin  '*  fiU-a 
me-a,  bon-a  et  pulchr-a." 

There  are  now  168  languages  and  55  dialects 
in  this  family  known  by  name.  They  break  up 
into  three  distinct  branches,  comprising  the  Kaffir, 
Bechuana,  and  Tekeza  branches  in  the  south;  the 
tongues  of  natives  of  the  Zambesi,  Zanzibar,  and 
the  great  lake  regions  in  the  east;  and  the  lan- 
guages of  Angola,  the  Congo,  and  the  Gaboon  in  the 
west. 

6.  The  Hottentots  and  Bushmen. — The  great 
peculiarity  of  the  Hottentot  tongue  consists  in  the 
existence  of  four  clicks,  formed  by  a  different  posi- 
tion of  the  tongue,  and  known  as  the  dental,  lateral, 
guttural,  and  palatal  clicks.  Probably  these  were  the 
original  property  of  the  Bushmen,  whose  speech  is 
monosyllabic,  and  is  thought  by  some  to  be  the 
connecting  links  between  articulate  and  inarticulate 
sounds.  With  these  are  sometimes  grouped  the  pigmy 
tribes  scattered  throughout  the  forest  regions  of 
Equatorial  Africa. 


Pagan  and  Mohammedan  Africa, 

The  same  clue  which  led  us  to  a  right  understanding 
of  cUmate  and  of  race,  must  still  be  followed  when 
African  religions  are  studied.  Northern  and  Southern 
Africa  fairly  represent  to-day  two  phases  of  thought 
and  stages  of  progress  in  religious  consciousness. 
Almost  without  exception  the  Semite  and  Hamite 
races  of  North  Africa  are  Mohammedan,  while  the 
great  Negro  race,  where  unassailed  by  Islam  or  by 
Christianity,  adheres  to  Paganism  in  one  of  its  many 
forms. 

1.  Animism,  or  a  belief  in  a  spirit  world,  can  be 
traced  in  every  age  and  every  race  of  man.  It  is 
universally  agreed  that  man,  so  far  as  his  history  is 
known,  has  always  believed  in  a  supernatural  spirit, 


NAt'IVE   RACES,    LANGUAGES,    AND   RELIGIONS         IQ 

having  afl&nity  with  his  own  spirit,  and  power  over 
him.  Burton  is  said  to  have  discovered  some  wild 
Bedouins  of  the  desert  who  inquired  of  him  "  where 
Allah  was  to  be  found,"  and  Lichenstein  could  not 
find  in  the  Kussa  Kaffirs  the  "  appearance  of  any- 
religious  worship  whatever."  But  every  known  tribe 
in  Africa  has  some  sort  of  belief  in  an  unknown 
Power — with  the  Bushmen  it  is  a  belief  in  magic  ; 
with  the  Mangr^njas  dreams  are  taken  as  a  warrant  for 
beUeving  in  a,  ghost  world ;  while  the  Natives  of  Benin 
call  a  man's  shadow  his  guardian  spirit.  Some, 
however,  have  a  very  low  conception  of  cpirits — the 
Bechuanas  curse  their  deities,  the  Basutos  shriek  at 
them,  and  East  Africans,  in  order  to  terminate 
an  3Glipse  of  the  moon,  try  to  frighten  away  the 
sun. 

2.  Totemism  and  Nr.tTi.ve  Worship. — Totems 
are  a  clar^s  of  material  objectr:  zuch  as  animals,  plants 
and  trees,  lakoc  rsn.'\  river-.),  wIiicA  a  savage  regards

or  injures  or  gather:,  it,  if  a  plant,  except  on  the  most 
solemn  occasions  =  Totems  belong  to  a  whole  tnbe 
or  clan  in  common,  to  the  whole  of  either  sex  in  a 
tribe,  or  especially  to  an  individual.  "When  a  totem 
is  adopted  by  one  sex  only,  it  is  said  to  be  more 
sacred  than  the  totem  of  a  tribe.  There  are  tribal 
rites  of  initiation  to  jotem- worship,  inoculation  ^eing 
prcotised  by  all  Upper  Jongo  tribes.  Cc-sati  .peaks 
of  "  the  exchange  of  blood  being  often  practised  among 
the  blacks  of  Africa  as  a  token  of  alliance  and  friend- 
ship," especially  so  among  the  Sandeh  and  Monbuttu 
peoples.  There  are  three  different,  and  possibly 
successive,  forms  of  totems,  e.g.  animal,  vegetable,  and 
natural  objects.  These  mark  three  successive  stages 
of  civilization — the  domestication  of  animals,  the 
cultivation  of  plants,  and  the  confederation  of  tribes 
into  states. 

Animal  totems. — First,  then,  let  us  notice  the  wide- 
spread reverence  for  animals  in  Africa.  '*  A  Kaffir 
c  2 


20  AFRICA    IVAiTlNG 


does  not  often  slaughter  his  cattle,  except  for  sacrifice 
or  to  celebrate  a  marriage."  And  even  with  the 
cattle-rearing  Dinka  "  a  cow  is  never  slaughtered,  but 
when  sick  is  segregated  from  the  rest,  and  carefully 
tended  in  large  huts  built  for  the  purpose."  It  is 
hardly  necessary  to  be  reminded  of  how  the  Egyptians 
used  to  worship  the  calf-god  Apis.  Even  now  the 
natives  on  the  White  Nile  will  not  eat  an  ox.  Again, 
the  Hottentots  name  their  children  after  the  names 
of  animals.  Passing  on  from  cattle  to  reptiles, 
we  notice  that  the  serpent  used  to  be  worshipped 
in  parts  of  Upper  Egypt  and  Abyssinia,  while  the  snake 
was  the  principal  deity  of  the  Negroes  from  Liberia 
to  Benguela ;  and  even  to-day  we  hear  of  the  Dahomian 
snake  worship  at  Whydah,  and  the  penalty  of  death 
to  any  one  who  kills  one  of  their  pythons.  Many- 
Kaffirs,  too,  have  a  belief  that  the  spirits  of  their 
ancestors  appear  to  them  in  the  form  of  serpents. 
The  same  is  true  of  birds  and  fish,  and  Bechuana  tribes 
are  subdivided  into  men  of  the  crocodile,  the  fish,  the 
monkey,  the  buffalo,  the  elephant,  &c. ;  while  the 
Negroes  of  Guinea  reverence  the  sword-fish. 

Plant  totems. — It  is  possible  that  through  plant- 
worship,  cereals  and  food-plants  came  to  be  cultivated, 
and  that  this  religious  observance  led  to  their  growth. 
Tree  totems  make  their  appearance  in  the  marriage 
rite,  and  are  closely  connected  with  taboo- worship. 
A  curious  instance  of  taboo  is  the  abstinence  of  a 
certain  West  African  tribe  in  the  interior  from^  use  of 
the  plantain.  It  seems  very  Hkely  that  this  may 
have  caused  the  widespread  cultivation  of  the  plantain, 
just  as  the  domestication  of  animals  has  led  to  their 
increase. 

Nature  Worship  arises  from  a  belief  in  spirits 
animating  everything.  A  flood,  a  fire,  a  lightning 
flash,  the  scorching  sun  at  noonday,  and  the  phases 
of  the  moon  by  night,  all  these  are  mysteries  which 
Africans  have  worshipped  in  the  past.  The  deifica- 
tion of  these  natural  objects  has  always  preceded  a 
more  general  form  of  nature  worship,  which  has  been 


NATIVE  RACES ^   LANGUAGES^   AND   RELIGIONS        21 

found  to  lead  in  every  case  to  a  more  fully  developed 
form  of  polytheism  or  pantheism. 

3.  Polytheism. — As  we  have  hinted  above,  pastoral 
life  tends  to  produce  clans,  whereas  agriculture  brings  a 
fixed  abode.  Political  progress  now  becomes  possible, 
and  several  tribes  have  to  bo  fused  into  one  state.  But 
tribal  gods  often  remain  distinct,  hence  one  form  of 
polytheism.  An  excellent  example  of  this  is  found 
among  the  tribes  of  the  Gold  Coast,  where  the  Fantis 
in  the  south  form  one  confederation  under  their  god 
Bobowissi,  while  their  more  powerful  neighbours, 
the  Ashantis,  call  their  god  Tando.  And  whenever 
any  tribe  revolts  from  the  Ashantis,  it  renounces 
the  Ashanti  god  Tando,  and  joins  the  worship  of 
Bobowissi. 

Colonel  Ellis,  in  his  remarkable  book  "  The  Tshi- 
speaking  peoples  of  the  Gold  Coast,"  groups  the  Gold 
Coast  deities  under  four  heads,  as  follows  : — 

(a)  Those  worshipped  by  an  entire  tribe,  or  by  one 
or  more  tribes.  These,  which  may  be  termed  General 
Deities,  are  few  in  number. 

{h)  Those  worshipped  by  the  inhabitants  of  certain 
towns,  locahties,  or  districts.  These  are  the  Local 
Deities,  the  spirits  of  the  neighbouring  rivers,  forests, 
hills  and  sea.  They  are  very  numerous,  every  localit|^ 
having  several.     Their  general  name  is  Bohsmn. 

(c)  Those  worshipped  by  smaller  sections  of  the 
community,  such  as  by  special  families  or  town 
companies.  Each  family  or  town  company  has  its 
own  deity  of  this  class,  who  gives  protection  in  return 
for  worship  and  sacrifice. 

(d)  Those  worshipped  by  one  individual.  These 
are  the  Tutelary  Deities  of  individuals.  Their  general 
name  is  Suliman. 

The  deities  of  class  (6)  are  believed  to  have  been 
appointed  by  those  of  class  (a) ;  those  of  class  (c)  by 
those  of  class  {h),  through  the  agency  of  the  priesthood ; 
while  those  of  class  (d)  are  obtained  by  individuals 
for  themselves  in  a  variety  of  ways.  The  last  two 
classes  are  clearly  the  product  and  result  of  priestcraft. 


22  AFRICA    WAlTlim 

"  The  method  by  which  the  Negro  of  Western 
Africa  obtains  a  Suliman  is  an  exact  copy  of  the 
legitimate  ritual  by  which  a  family  obtains  a  family 
god ;  the  Negro  who  requires  a  tutelary  deity  for  his 
family  applies  to  the  priest."  Very  different  is  it  when 
an  individual  privately  resorts  to  one  of  the  spirits 
(for  this  is  a  case  of  a  direct  relapse  into  animism). 
This  leads  us  on  to  explain  the  real  nature  of  fetishism. 

Fetishism. — It  is  a  pity  that  the  word  *'  fetish  "  has 
been  applied  to  almost  every  form  of  African  super- 
stition .  The  word  comes  from  the  Portuguese ' '  f eitigo, ' ' 
an  amulet  or  charm,  and  is  properly  restricted  to 
inanimate  objects.  It  is  a  mistake  to  use  it  to 
designate  local  nature  spirits  or  animals  held  in 
reverence.  If  the  above  forms  of  worship  have  been 
carefully  studied,  it  will  be  clearly  seen  that "  fetishism, 
the  worship  of  tangible  and  inanimate  objects,  is 
not  at  all  characteristic  of  primitive  peoples.  It  is 
only  arrived  at  after  considerable  progress  has  been 
made  in  religious  ideas,  and  owes  its  existence  to 
gradual  loss  of  belief  in  the  indwelling  god,  until  the 
power,  originally  believed  to  belong  to  the  god,  is 
finally  attributed  to  the  tangible  or  inanimate  object 
itself." 

It  will  be  well  here  to  notice  the  functions  of  African 
Pagan  priests. 

The  Priesthood. — It  appears  that  the  Negroes  of  the 
Gold  Coast  have  an  order  of  priests,  chosen  for  life,  who 
have  become  quite  indispensable.  In  Egypt,  it  will  be 
remembered,  the  chief  rulers  used  to  be  high-priest  and 
king  in  one,  and  this  is  still  the  case  in  several  parts 
of  Africa.  These  king-priests  are  liable,  however,  to 
be  put  to  death  for  several  causes,  and  the  executioner 
may  be  the  destined  successor  of  the  king.  It  is  still 
more  remarkable  that  among  the  Damaras  the  chiefs 
have  a  kind  of  sacerdotal  authority — more  so  than  a 
military  one.  '  They  bless  the  oxen,  just  as  the 
Bulgarian  priests  do  to-day. 

Funeral  Rites  show  that  a  general  belief  in  a  ghost 
world  has  always  existed,  and  a  Yoruba  proverb  runs :— 


NATIVE   RACES,    LANGUAGES,   AND   RELIGIONS        2$ 

"  A  corner  in  this  world  is  better  than  a  corner  in  the 
world  of  spirits."  Still  there  seems  to  be  an  absence  of 
belief  in  any  future  life  among  the  East  Africans,  for 
their  wail  of  sorrow  cannot  rise  above  "  Amekwisha  " 
or  "  he  is  finished  ;"  while  ''  All  is  done  for  ever  "  is 
the  song  of  the  West  Africans.  Ancestral  worship,  too, 
springs  from  a  belief  in  departed  spirits.  These  spirits 
are  supposed  to  have  the  power  of  inflicting  storms, 
floods,  lightning,  diseases,  &c.  They  need  therefore 
to  be  appeased,  or  exorcised,  whence  come  witchcraft, 
sorcery,  divination,  and  all  their  attendant  horrors. 

Idolatry. — "  Only  one  people  in  East  Africa,"  says 
Burton,  "  possess  idols,  and  these  come  from  the  West." 
But  in  Congo-land  they  are  to  be  found  everywhere, 
and  the  Gaboon  Pagans  have  a  curious  plan  of  lodging 
their  idols  in  dwarf  huts.  There  is,  however,  nothing 
in  Africa  Hke  the  elaborate  image- worship  in  India. 

4.  Monotheism. — A  belief  in  monotheism  is  also 
prevalent  in  Africa  to-day,  and,  though  by  no  means 
confined  to  followers  of  Mohammed,  yet  Islam  has 
been  undoubtedly  the  greatest  means  for  reviving  and 
intensifying  such  a  belief.  We  therefore  propose  to 
make  some  study  of  Islam  in  Africa.  Of  the  three 
missionary  religions,  as  Prof.  Max  Miiller  calls 
Buddhism,  Mohammedanism,  and  Christianity,  none 
has  in  so  marked  a  degree  overstepped  the  hmits  of  race 
as  the  religion  of  Mohammed.  True,  Christianity,  like 
Islam,  took  its  rise  among  Semitic  peoples.  But,  ever 
since  Christianity  left  the  place  of  its  birth,  it  has  really 
only  taken  possession  of  whole  races  among  the 
European  branch  of  the  human  family.  And  though 
Christianity  to-day  surrounds  the  lands  of  Islam,  in  so 
doing  it  still  followed  the  migration  and  settlements  of 
the  Aryan  race.  Let  us  here  take  four  aspects  of 
Mohammedanism  in  Africa  to-day — its  extent  and 
present  state,  its  strength  and  evils. 

Islam  in  Africa. — Islam  among  Semitic  and  semi- 
Semitic  races  is  quite  different  from  Islam  among 
Mongolian  and  Indo-European  races,  as  in  Turkey, 
Persia,  and  India.     It  is  too  generally  taken  for  granted 


24  AFRICA    WAITING 


that  it  is  a  rigidly  uniform  system,  and  that  the  Turk 
is  the  type  and  representative  of  the  whole  Moslem 
world.  Therefore,  in  dealing  with  this  large  subject 
there  must  be  no  mistake  at  the  outset  on  this  point. 

The  propagation  of  Islam  in  Africa  has  been  carried 
on  by  successive  Arab  immigrations.  Since  Mo- 
hammed's death  at  the  lowest  estimate  250,000  Arabs 
have  passed  into  Africa  from  Asia.  They  have  followed 
three  different  directions  and  three  separate  methods  of 
proselytizing — commerce,  persuasion,  and  the  sword. 

The  Field. — 1.  North  Africa  and  Western  Sudan. — 
Within  seventy  years  of  their  prophet's  death,  the 
Arabs  had  become  masters  of  North  Africa,  and  its 
richest  states  had  been  taken  away  from  the  influences 
of  Christendom,  leaving  North  African  Christianity 
to  Hnger  on  for  centuries  in  isolation.  Literary  and 
commercial  capitals  were  founded  at  Fez,  Kairouan, 
and  Morocco,  and  industries  were  encouraged.  Arab 
rule  at  that  time  was  really  beneficial,  and  culture  was 
as  high  as  anywhere  in  Europe,  save  Byzantium.  The 
position  of  women,  too,  was  higher  than  it  is  to-day. 

By  A.D.  1000,  not  only  had  the  Berbers  submitted  to 
Islam  and  adopted  Arabic  as  their  language,  but  even 
Timbuctu  was  reached.  From  here  Mohammedanism 
found  an  entrance  into  the  countries  of  the  Jalofs, 
Mandingos,  and  Fulahs.  Then,  turning  east,  it  reached 
Lake  Chad  by  the  thirteenth  century,  to  be  stopped 
there  for  a  time  by  opposition  in  the  empire  of  Kanem 
on  the  north-east  of  the  lake. 

2.  Upper  Egypt  and  Eastern  Sudan. — Lane  tells  us 
that  the  Nubians  were  quite  early  converted  from 
Christianity  in  wholesale  fashion.  Schweinfurth  dubs 
them  as  about  "  as  unscrupulous  rascals  as  any  in  the 
world."  Kordofan  has  Arab  traces  by  the  fourteenth 
century.  Sennaar  was  organized  into  a  kingdom  in  the 
sixteenth  century.  Wadai,  Darfur,  and  Bagirmi  were 
probably  not  converted  to  Islam  till  a  hundred  years 
later. 

Generally  speaking,  therefore,  the  influence  of  Islam 
between  the  eleventh  and  seventeenth  centuries,  ex- 


NATIVE  RACES,   LANGUAGES^   AND   RELIGIONS        2^ 


tended  over  all  the  Sudan,  and  many  of  these  peoples 
are  now  bigoted  Moslems. 

3.  East  Africa. — The  Zeila  empire  on  the  Somali 
coast,  with  its  sacred  capital,  Harrar,  was  founded  as 
early  as  a.d.  740,  and  the  heathen  Gallas  were  partially 
converted.  Two  hundred  years  later  the  states  of 
Magadosha  and  Kilwa,  on  the  East  Coast,  were  started, 
the  better  known  MeHnde  and  Mombasa  rising  later 
still.  A  regular  trade  between  the  Persian  Gulf  and 
East  Africa  was  firmly  established  by  the  time  the 
Portuguese  arrived  off  these  coasts.  But  the  lack  of 
military  organization,  and  the  solely  trading  propen- 
sities of  the  Arabs,  caused  a  general  failure  to  win 
over  these  peoples  to  Islam. 

The  Present  Century. — Several  remarkable 
revivals  of  proselytizing  zeal  have  taken  place 
during  this  century.  The  first  was  due  to  the  rise  of 
Othman  dan  Fodio.  This  man,  a  Fulah  by  birth, 
returned  from  Mecca  infected  by  Wahabee  notions, 
received  a  vision  of  Mohammed  commissioning  him  to 
be  an  apostle  of  Islam,  and  to  mark  the  place,  founded 
the  city  of  Sokoto.  Then  he  proclaimed  the  Jehad,  or 
holy  war,  against  the  infidels  in  1802,  resulting  in  the 
empire  of  Sokoto.  Puritan  Islam  was  established, 
and  only  checked  from  spreading  further  eastwards 
near  to  Lake  Chad.  On  the  death  of  Othman  this 
great  kingdom  was  divided,  into  Sokoto  and  Gando 
on  the  east  and  the  empire  of  Massina  on  the  west. 
Among  its  later  apostles  Samadu  must  be  mentioned, 
as  having  become  in  our  day  "  the  scourge  of  all  the 
peaceable  states  on  the  right  bank  of  the  Upper  Niger." 

Another  recent  movement  began  among  the  Senusi 
of  Tripoli,  who  have  formed  a  strong  Mohammedan 
brotherhood  in  North  Africa,  full  of  bigotry  and 
intolerance.  The  third  and  best  known  attempt  at 
continental  rule  was  that  of  the  Mahdists'  insurrection 
in  1882,  when  all  the  Eastern  Sudan  rose  up  in  arms. 
This  wiU  ever  be  connected  with  General  Gordon's 
name  and  martyrdom.  A  fourth  and  final  effort  to 
establish  Arab  sway  in  Central  Africa  was  checked  by 


26  AFRICA    WAITING 

the  Belgians  (1892-4),  during  which  war  Nyangwe, 
long  the  central  source  of  the  Arab  slave  trade  in 
Central  Africa,  was  captured. 

East  Africa  has  seen  a  vast  increase  of  Arab  trade 
during  this  century.  Livingstone's  travels  opened  up 
the  interior,  and  at  once  the  Arabs  followed  in  his  track. 
Elsewhere  the  horrors  of  the  Arab  slave  trade  are 
alluded  to.  The  best  known  effort  to  convert  an  East 
African  nation  was  that  of  Arab  traders  in  Uganda. 
But  King  Mtesa  chose  the  Christian's  Book  instead 
of  the  Koran. 

The  Strength  of  Islam. — Nothing  is  gained  by 
minimizing  the  great  political,  social  and  rehgious 
strength  of  Islam  in  Africa.  The  following  are  some 
of  the  causes  of  strength,  as  borne  witness  to  by  several 
travellers.  They  must,  however,  be  taken  with  some 
reservation  until  more  complete  knowledge  is  to  hand. 

Socially f  a  kind  of  freemasonry  is  set  up  wherever 
Islam  goes.  A  general  moral  elevation  is  observable, 
at  any  rate  in  parts  of  the  Sudan.  For  instance, 
natives  begin  to  dress  more  neatly;  they  become 
cleaner,  and  more  industrious.  And  even  supposing  the 
indigo  dye  trade  in  Hausaland  to  be  nearly  1000  years 
old,  yet  works  in  metals  and  other  goods  have  been 
introduced  by  Moslems.  Large  towns,  such  as  Kano, 
Sokoto,  Timbuctu,  Sego,  have  been  founded,  and 
are  now  governed  by  Moslem  laws.  Their  markets 
are  filled  with  commerce  and  thronged  with  vendors. 
Education  of  a  primitive  kind  is  universal.  Boys  are 
kept  under  instruction  for  years.  Before  a  student  is 
admitted  to  the  ranks  of  the  learned,  he  must  pass  an 
examination,  in  some  places  of  seven  days,  conducted 
by  a  board  of  im§.ms  and  ulemas.  If  he  is  successful, 
he  is  presented  with  a  sash  or  scarf,  usually  of  fine 
white  cloth  and  native  manufacture,  to  wind  round  his 
cap  and  form  an  Oriental  turban,  a  sort  of  M.A.  hood. 
Those  who  are  allowed  to  wear  these  turbans  have 
read  through  and  recited  the  Koran  many  hundred 
times,  whether  they  understand  it  or  not.  In  all 
thriving  communities,   in  West  and  Central  Africa, 


NATIVE  RACES ^   LANGUAGES^   AND  RELIGIONS       2*1 

there  has  been  a  healthy  amalgamation  of  the  Mo- 
hammedan Negro  and  Arab,  so  that  it  is  contended  by- 
some  that  the  longer  the  tribes  have  been  converted 
the  greater  the  superiority  of  the  rr^ce. 

Lastly,  Islam  demands  total  abstinence  from  intoxi- 
cants of  all  its  followers.  Do  they  abstain  ?  Testi- 
monies from  Captains  Binger  and  Lugard,  the  late  Mr. 
Joseph  Thomson,  ind  Mr.  C.  H.  Eobinson  are  all  to  the 
contrary.  They  say  the  Fulah  peoples  are  ^.  drunken 
race.  But  why  ?  It  is  no  fault  of  the  precepts  of 
Islam,  but  a  lack  of  power  to  put  them  into  practice. 
Islam  as  k,  system  is  a  solid  protest  against  the  drink. 

Politically y  the  spread  of  Arabic  is  a  unifying  factor. 
It  is  he  language  of  reverence,  and  of  covenant,  the  bond 
between  the  nations.  The  conversion  of  w' olc  tribes 
to  Islam,  as  in  the  case  of  the  Nubians  and  Moslems 
of  the  Eastern  Sudan,  have  dangerous  effects  when 
they  are  stirred  up  to  rebellion,  as  are  the  Mahdists 
at  present.  The  pilgrimage  to  Mecca  has  as  stimul?jting 
an  influence  on  them  as  conferences  on  us.  On  their 
return  home,  leaders,  poets,  and  charm-writers  arise 
in  numbers.  Thus  every  year,  for  good  or  evil,  Islam 
advances  nearer  to  the  equator,  and  closer  to  the 
Guinea  Coast.  There  is  scarcely  a  town  along  the 
West  and  East  Coast  now  without  its  mosque. 

Religiously,  Islam  brings  the  belief  in  one  God. 
Except  in  countries  such  as  Yoruba,  where  a  belief  in 
a  Creator  already  exists,  this  marks  a  great  advance ; 
it  means  the  banishment  of  polytheism,  the  gradual 
removal  of  sorcery  and  human  sacrifice.  Secondly, 
Islam  is  continually  making  converts,  some  even  from 
among  nominal  Christians.  This  is  doubtless  due  to 
its  number  of  native  African  missionaries. 

The  Evils  of  Islam. — On  the  other  hand,  the  evils 
of  Mohammedanism  are  undeniable.  Several  gross 
evils  must  be  mentioned  here.  Sir  William  Muir,  who 
has  studied  the  question  so  fully,  says  very  clearly  that 
'*  polygamy,  divorce,  and  slavery  are  perpetrated  and 
maintained  by  that  religion,"  i  striking  at  the  root  of 
»  Cf.  Chapters  III.,  IV.,  VII. 


«8  AFRICA    WAITING 


public  morals,  poisoning  domestic  life,  and  disorganizing 
society.  Freedom  of  thought  is  almost  unknown  among 
its  adherents,  for  to  abandon  Islam  is  death  ;  therefore 
it  has  afforded  one  of  the  most  complete  barriers  against 
Christianity.  The  sword  of  Mohammed  (the  jehad)  is 
the  most  stubborn  enemy  of  liberty,  civilization  and 
truth  that  the  world  has  ever  known. 

Moreover,  the  spread  of  Mohammedanism  and  the 
spread  of  Chriotianity  cannot  be  compared;  for  the 
spread  of  the  former  is  a  social  rather  than  a  religious 
question.  There  is  no  demand  made  for  a  change  of 
heart  or  life. 

The  Problem  of  Islam. — What  then  is  the 
Mohammedan  missionary  problem  in  Africa  to-day  ? 
Briefly,  how  to  reach  sixty  million  souls  scattered  over 
an  area  half  again  as  large  as  Europe. 

Between  the  sources  of  the  Niger  and  the  valley 
of  the  Nile  there  is  no  Christian  witness  whatever, 
except  a  few  copies  of  the  Arabic  Bible  and  Testament. 
All  the  intervening  kingdoms  are  abandoned  to  die  in 
ignorance  of  Christ,  and  there  is  no  other  mission-field 
in  such  a  case.  Surely  a  chain  of  Christian  stations 
should  be  started  without  further  delay  across  the 
great  Sudan's  3000  miles.

NoRTHEKi?  Africa,  as  already  defined,  means  that  part 
of  the  continent  which  has  been  peopled  by  the  two 
so  called  Mediterranean  races.  This  great  region  con- 
tains an^  area  somewhat  larger  than  that  of  Europe 
and  a  Mohammedan  population  of  about  25,000,000. 
It  falls  naturally  into  three  main  divisions— the  North 
African  States  of  Morocco,  Algeria,  Tunis,  and  Tripoli, 
the  great  Sahara  desert  stretching  from  the  Atlantic 
on  the  west  to  the  Nile  on  the  east,  and  the  Nile 
regions  of  Egypt,  Nubia,  and  Abyssinia. 

North  African  History  is  full  of  interest. 
Ancient  Druid  mounds  are  to  be  found  in  Morocco. 
Euins  and  monuments  of  ancient  Carthage  and  other 
Phenician  cities  remind  us  of  their  past  commercial 
greatness.  We  remember,  too,  the  Greek  colony  of 
Cyrene,  and  Eome's  fairest  province  of  ''Africa,"  the 
granary  of  her  Empire.  Lastly,  Egypt's  ancient  river 
has  claimed  to  keep  along  its  banks  witnesses  to  the 
world's  earliest  civilization. 

In  Christian  times  Africa  has  been  adorned  by 
names  like  TeytuUian,  Cyprian,  Athanasius,  and 
Augustine.  But  when  controversies  arose,  the  Arian 
Vandals  found  a  footing  there,  and  sorely  persecuted 
the  Christians.  A  still  greater  judgment  fell  upon  the 
Church  when  Moslem  Akbar  led  his  10,000  horsemen 
into  Africa,  and,  within  seventy  years  of  the  death  of 
Mohammed,  all  North  Africa  fell  a  prey  to  the  Arabs, 
and  a  death-blow  had  been  dealt  to  African  Christianity. 
We  must  not  stop  to  speak  of  Arab  rule  and  literature,

of  Turkish  conquests  in  the  fifteenth  century ;  :  or  to 
compare  the  rival  claims  (to  the  Caliphate)  of  Suitans 
of  Morocco  with  those  of  Turkey.  We  merely  allude 
to  the  "Barbary  Corsairs,"  or  the  Moorish  pirates  of 
Algeria,  who  were  once  ''  the  scourge  of  Christendom," 
and  a  universal  terror  to  Europe  and  even  to 
America.  Within  our  own  day  European  policy  has  left 
Morocco  governed  by  a  youthful  Sultan,  whose  name 
is  Abdul  Aziz.  France  has  renovated  x\lgeria  into  a 
beautiful  and  healthy  colony  and  taken  Tunis  prac- 
tically under  her  rule.  Tripoli  still  remains  a  province 
of  the  Turkish  Empire,  and  Egypt  tributary  to  Turkey, 
but  protected  and  supervised  by  the  British  Govern- 
ment. Abyssinia  under  King  Menelik  of  Shoa 
acknowledges  "  the  mutual  protection  "  of  Italy,  while 
France  and  Britain  both  have  small  protectorates  off 
the  Gulf  of  Aden. 

North  African  States. 

Speaking  generally,  the  climate  of  North  Africa  re- 
sembles that  of  Southern  Europe,  and  especially  that  of 
Spain  and  Portugal.  The  northern  slopes  of  the  Atlas 
Mountains  are  clothed  with  forests  of  Europea^i  treec, 
while  the  extensive  plateaux  of  Tripoli  are  coversc^  ^^i^^th 
alfa  grass,  ou!.  of  which  paper  is  made.  Further  east 
the  land  of  Barca  is  full  of  evergreens.  The  earliest 
inhabitants  of  North  Africa  were  the  Hamite  Berbers, 
who  still  form  a  Ir.rge  element  in  the  population.  Of 
subsequent  settlers  and  invaders  the  Arabs  alone  have 
left  many  representatives,  and  these  have  become  much 
intermingled  with  the  Berbers.  In  the  northern  coast- 
lands  the  Arab  element  is  to  be  found  chiefly  in  the 
east,  though  in  the  Sahara  the  reverse  is  the  case. 

The  Berbers  are  more  inclined  to  settle  down  as  cul- 
tivators than  the  Arabs,  who  prefer  to  remain  a  nomadic 
pastoral  people.  The  states  founded  after  the  Moslem 
invasions  have  left  their  mark  in  North  Africa  to-day, 
and  we  now  proceed  to  look  at  them  separately. 

Morocco,  with  Fez,  Mequinez,  and  Mcrakesh  as 
its  capital  towns,  is  three  times  the  size  of  the  United 


NORTH  AFRICA^   EGYPTy    AND  ABYSSINIA  31 

Kingdom.  It  is  only  six  days*  journey  from  England. 
There  are  very  great  differences  of  opinion  as  to  the 
population,  but  it  is  probably  somewhere  about  six 
millions,  and  is  only  increasing  in  the  oases  of  Tafilet 
and  Tuat,  the  latter  of  which  is  now  laid  claim  to  by  the 
French.  This  is  due  to  the  comparative  safety  of  these 
dwelling-places.  Among  its  peoples  are  found  the 
ancient  Berber  stock,  the  Moors,  pure  Arabs,  Jews, 
and  Negroes.  The  Moors  predominate  in  the  towns, 
and  the  Berbers  in  the  villages  and  the  hills.  The 
Negroes  are  either  captured  slaves  or  their  liberated 
descendants.  The  Jews,  300,000  in  number,  are  all 
refugees  from  Europe  or  emigrants  from  Palestine. 
There  is  no  aristocracy,  but  people  of  the  highest 
class  are  called  "  shereefs "  or  "  descendants  of  the 
prophet,"  and  to  t"his  class  the  young  Sultan  belongs. 
The  people  in  the  West  of  Morocco  are  the  most 
degraded  and  enslaved.  Their  condition  is,  perhaps,  a 
little  better  than  in  most  Moslem  countries,  especially 
among  the  Berbers ;  for  v^th  them  married  women  have 
some  domestic  influence,  and  some  even  have  rights  of 
inheritance,  a  custom  older,  needless  to  say,  than 
Moslem  times.  In  South  Morocco,  Rohlfs  speaks  of 
religious  orders  with  women  as  leaders. 

It  is  the  custom  to  have  only  one  wife,  but  divorces 
are  frequent,  with  attendant  evil  consequences.  Girls 
and  young  women  go  about  unveiled,  except  in  the 
towns.  They  have  beautiful  figures  and  features, 
and  love-marriages  are  common.  Domestic  life  is 
patriarchal,  and  Arab  men  and  women  are  given  Bible 
or  Koran  names,  while  Berbers  choose  Pagan  names. 
The  people  are  noted  for  their  hospitality,  but  harvest 
time  is  a  time  for  universal  drinking,  and  the  people 
get  sadly  drunk.  The  poor  live  on  milk,  butter,  eggs, 
and  a  kind  of  porridge.  Only  the  richer  folk  eat  meat. 
Education  is  at  a  very  low  ebb,  and  less  than  ten  per 
cent,  of  the  people  can  read.  Women  are  positively 
not  allowed  to  learn.  There  are  schools  in  every 
village,  where  boys  are  taught  to  repeat  portions  of  the 
Koran  and  the    Hadeeth.      The  Moors    follow  the 


314  AFRICA    WAITING 


Moslem  sect  of  Malekites,  but  are  very  ignorant. 
Their  service  in  assemblies  consists  often  only  in 
shouting  "  Allah  !  ",  or  the  Shehad,  thousands  of  times. 
The  name  of  God  is  always  on  their  lips,  and  a  belief 
in  predestination  is  of  course  part  of  their  system. 

Industry  is  paralyzed  by  the  covetousness  of  the 
Court.  Whatever  commerce  exists  is  due  to  England 
and  France.  There  are  no  railways  whatever.  Ce- 
reals and  fruit,  leather- work,  rugs  and  carpets,  are 
exported,  but  with  prohibitive  tariffs.  Ignorance  of 
medicine  is  profound,  and  only  the  elements  of  surgery 
are  understood.  The  chief  diseases  in  Morocco  are 
syphilis,  small-pox,  several  forms  of  eye-disease  and 
cataract,  ringworm  almost  without  exception  among 
the  boys,  and  leprosy  in  the  South.  The  need  of 
medical  missions  is  great,  and  three  Missionary 
Societies  have  made  a  noble  start.  There  seems  more 
promise  of  early  results  to  mission  work  among  the 
Berber  race  than  among  the  Moors  and  Arabs. 

Algeria  and  Tunis. — These  two  countries  were 
long  nominally  vassal  states  of  the  Turkish  empire, 
though  under  powerful  rulers  of  their  own,  known  as 
Deys  of  Algiers  and  Beys  of  Tunis.  Since  1830 
Algeria  has  belonged  to  the  French  and  become  a 
costly  colony,  and  since  1881  the  Bey  has  accepted 
French  protection  for  Tunis. 

Algeria  is  within  fifty-five  hours'  journey  of  London, 
and  has  a  population  of  4,000,000,  in  a  country  twice 
the  size  of  France.  The  French  have  made  an 
enormous  outlay  on  its  roads  and  railways,  irrigation 
works,  and  port  of  PhilippeviUe,  at  the  rate,  it  is  said, 
of  £160  per  colonist.  This  beautiful  country  has 
become  a  home  for  the  unemployed,  and  8000  families 
from  Alsace  and  Lorraine  have  emigrated  here. 
Every  European  fruit,  vegetable,  and  grain  is  grown ; 
figs,  oranges,  vines,  and  oUves  among  the  number, 
besides  dates  and  tobacco.  Mineral  stores  of  marble, 
iron,  lead,  salt,  and  copper  have  been  discovered.  Hither 
ihe  birds  of  Europe,  such  as  the  thrush,  the  starling, 
and  the  nightingale,  come  to  spend  the  winter.     Here 


NORTH   AFRICA^    EGYPT,    AND   ABYSSINIA  33 

are  found  the  stork,  pelican,  partridge,  quail,  and 
various  kinds  of  ducks.  Year  by  year  the  French  are 
extending  their  authority  southwards,  and  now  lay 
claim  to  the  oases  of  Tuat,  which  used  to  belong  to 
Morocco.  Cultivation  (and  with  it  population)  has  of 
late  years  been  much  extended  in  this  part  of  Algeria 
by  the  boring  of  artesian  wells,  which  now  irrigc^te 
many  districts  formerly  arid.  In  time  it  is  intended 
to  form  a  chain  of  oases  in  this  way,  right  across  the 
Sahara  desert  to  Lake  Chad,  and  so  to  make  a  trans- 
Saharan  railway  possible. 

Tunis  has  a  population  of  \\  millions,  the  foreign 
element  being  much  smaller  than  in  Algeria. 
Italians  and  Jews  form  the  most  numerous  sections. 
Maltese  are  the  shop-keepers,  caf ^-holders,  cattle- 
dealers,  boatmen,  and  fishermen.  During  the  last 
sixteen  years  wonderful  progress  has  been  made. 
Grapes  and  wheat  are  now  grown  in  abundance. 
Farms  have  been  started,  canals  constructed,  schools, 
colleges,  and  libraries  have  been  founded.  Order  pre- 
vails, and  even  religious  toleration,  for  the  sacred 
city  and  temple  of  Kairouan  can  be  entered  by  a 
Christian  for  a  fee. 

Tripoli,  a  province  of  the  Turkish  Empire,  extends 
from  Tunis  to  Egypt,  and  south  into  the  desert  so  as 
to  occupy  a  space  nearly  four  times  as  large  as  Great 
Britain.  Its  sandy  coasts  are  backed  by  a  waterless 
plateau,  and  this  in  turn  by  the  oasis  of  Fezzan.  Its 
peoples  are  chiefly  Arab  tribes,  with  a  few  Berbers 
inland.    The  negro  Tibbus  border  Fezzan  to  the  south. 

Not  much  has  to  be  said  about  the  country,  except  that 
Tripoli  and  Benghazi  are  the  outlets  for  Sudan  trade, 
which  is  chiefly  in  ostrich  feathers.  The  powerful 
Moslem  sect  of  Senusi  is  a  great  obstacle  to  the 
progress  of  the  Gospel  in  Eastern  Tripoli. 

Missions  to  Morocco,  Algeria,  Tunis,  and  Tripoli. 

Ever  since  the  "  non-missionary "  North  African 
Church  was  swept  away  and  gave  place  to 
Islam,    there    have     been    noble    followers    of    St,

Francis  and  St.  Dominic,  who  have  gladly  died  by 
the  hundred  that  the  light  might  dawn  again  over  the 
land  where  once  Augustine  preached.  There  is  abun- 
dant testimony  also  to  the  high  example  set  by  Eoman 
and  French  Missions  within  this  century.  But  it  was 
only  sixteen  years  ago  that  the  first  permanently 
successful  Protestant  Mission  was  started. 

The  North  African  Mission  deserves  our  first  atten- 
tion. Originally  started  in  1881  by  Mr.  George 
Pearse  and  then  called  the  '*  Mission  to  the  Kabyles  "  of 
Algeria,  it  has  now  grown  until  its  sphere  includes 
every  Mediterranean  state.  Its  mission  staff  in  the 
field,  which  will  soon  have  reached  100  workers,  is 
responsible  for  almost  all  the  interest  lately  aroused  in 
this  long  neglected  field.  The  Arabs  and  Berbers  have 
been  found  not  altogether  unapproachable,  and  hospital 
and  dispensary  work  has  opened  many  a  closed  door. 
The  work  is  now  carried  on  among  Jews  as  well  as 
Mohammedans,  and  it  is  hoped  that  some  will  soon 
come  forward  and  offer  to  penetrate  into  the  Sahara 
with  the  Gospel. 

Among  other  agencies  at  work,  the  work  of  the 
British  and  Foreign  Bible  Society  must  be  mentioned. 
Last  year  15,000  portions  of  the  Scriptures  were  circu- 
lated in  Algeria  and  Tunis  in  nineteen  languages.  The 
London  Jews  Society  has  some  good  schools  for  Jews 
in  Tunis,  supervised  by  Mr.  Flad,  who  was  formerly 
so  successful  among  the  Falasha  Jews  of  Abyssinia, 
and  as  intermediary  between  England  and  King 
Theodore  in  the  Magdala  campaign.  Good  work  is 
being  done  by  the  South  Morocco  Mission,  the 
World's  Gospel  Mission  of  Kansas  in  North  Morocco, 
the  Open  Brethren  in  Kabylia,  and  several  individual 
men  and  women  of  faith  and  prayer. 

The  Sahara. 

South  of  these  Mediterranean  states,  and  stretching 

from  the  Atlantic  to  the  Nile,  lies  the  great  desert  of 

Sahara.     It  has  an  area  twice  as  large  as  India,  but 

with  a  population,  it  is  thought,  of  not  more  than  two 


kOMTM   AFRICA^   EGYPT^   AND  ABYSSINIA  35 

millions  and  a  half.  It  must  not  be  supposed  that  all 
is  sandy  desert.  There  certainly  are  the  *' Ergs  "or 
dreaded  sandhills,  from  70  to  1000  feet  high,  but 
these  mostly  lie  to  the  south  of  the  Atlas  Mountains. 
Then  come  the  "  Hamada,"  or  stony  waterless 
plateaux,  often  2000  feet  high.  These  too  are  always 
barren  and  uninhabited  except  where  wells  exist,  and 
mostly  lie  between  Morocco  and  Timbuctu.  But  the 
"  Ahaggar  "  plateau  is  quite  different,  for  it  averages 
4000  feet  high,  and  is  covered  with  snow  for  three 
months  in  the  year.  Between  its  lofty  heights  heavy 
rains  and  melting  snow  have  hollowed  out  deep 
"  wadys,"  and  rivers  flow  into  inland  "  shotts  "  or 
lakes.  All  these  valleys  are  inhabited,  for  wells  can 
easily  be  sunk.  Nachtigal  says  that  the  Tibbu  hills 
rise  even  to  8000  feet,  and  the  oasis  of  Air  is  nearly 
as  lofty. 

This  is  not  the  place  to  discuss  the  geological  forma- 
tion of  the  desert.  But  there  is  abundant  evidence 
that  desiccation  has  gone  on  for  at  least  2000  years. 
Playfair  states  that  vast  subterranean  sheets  of  water 
abound  in  fish,  and  it  is  important  to  know  that 
almost  anywhere  water  can  be  found  by  sinking 
artesian  wells.  The  French  have  in  this  way  re- 
claimed large  areas  for  cultivation,  and  it  is  a  settled 
matter  of  policy  that  a  trans- Saharan  railway  will  be 
constructed  from  Algeria  to  Kuka  on  Lake  Chad,  a 
distance  of  1900  miles.  Already  the  railroad  extends 
to  the  pools  of  Biskra,  now  a  health  resort  for 
Europeans.  The  estimated  cost  of  such  a  work  would 
be  not  much  less  than  the  expenditure  on  the  Suez 
Canal,  namely  337  million  francs. 

The  climate  of  the  Sahara  is  exceedingly  healthy, 
but  there  are  several  dangers  liable  to  be  encountered, 
such  as  terrible  sandstorms,  intermittent  clouds  of 
locusts,  and  the  drying  up  of  watering  places.  The 
introduction  of  the  camel  has,  however,  largely  solved 
the  diflSculty  of  transport. 

As  to  products,  the  date-palm  can  be  grown  in 
any  oasis,  and  oranges,  lexaaons,  ^eache^,  figs,  pome'

granates,  rice,  millet,  and  durra  in  civilized  districts^ 
Salt  also  is  found  in  a  few  places. 

The  four  caravan  routes  should  be  noted.  (1) 
Morocco,  Ain-Salah,  and  Ghadames,  to  Cairo  (for 
Mecca  Pilgrims).     (2)  Kuka,    via  Murzuk  to  Tripoli. 

(3)  Tripoli,   Ghat,    and   Air  to    Timbuctu,  or  Kuka, 

(4)  Timbuctu  and  Ain-Salah  to  Morocco.  A  fifth 
route  known  only  to  the  Senusis  stretches  from  Wadai 
to  Benghazi  (in  Tripoli).  It  was  a^ong  the  first  of 
these  that  Laing  went  whei-  he  gained  'ihe  honour  of 
being  the  first  European  to  enter  Timbucoiu  He  was, 
however,  murdered  on  the  way  back.  Caill^,  the 
second  claimant,  came  back  by  the  Morocco  route, 
and  the  thrilUng  story  of  his  adventures  is  very  widely 
known. 

A  final  word  about  the  inhabitants  is  needed  to 
complete  the  story.  Arabs  mostly  inhabit  the  oases, 
Judaized  Tuaregs  act  as  guides  and  native  traders 
between  Timbuctu  and  Morocco,  while  the  Tuaregs 
themselves,  as  wild  nomads,  course  about  on  camels, 
robbing  caravans.  They  are  fanatical  Mohammedans, 
and  wear  a  cloth  round  the  lower  part  of  their  face. 
Strange  to  relate,  there  is  a  wider  knowledge  of  reading 
and  writing  among  these  Tuareg  men  and  women  than 
among  any  other  native  races  in  North  Africa.  One  of 
the  *'  North  African  "  missionaries  has  gone  to  Tripoli 
in  order  to  learn  their  language,  as  soon  as  he  has 
mastered  Arabic.  But  hitherto  the  vast  Sahara,  with 
its  scattered  population  of  Berber  and  Arab  Moham- 
medans, has  remained  without  a  single  missionary  I 

The  Nile  Valley. 

Herodotus,  the  Father  of  History,  spoke  of  Egypt  as 
"the  gift  of  the  Nile."  In  order  therefore  to  under- 
stand the  land  of  Egypt  we  must  trace  the  course  of 
the  Nile.  The  history  of  the  discovery  of  the  sources 
of  tho  Nile  is  left  to  chapter  V.  It  is  no  wonder  that 
the  ancients  sought  to  know  the  mystery  of  its  origin. 
For  from  the  Victoria  Nyanza  to  the  Mediterranean 
the  Nile  travels  3400  miles,   and  rolls  through  30°  of 


NORTH   AFRICA,    EGYPT ^    AND   ABYSSINIA  37 

k.titude.  Of  no  other  river  can  this  be  said,  not  even 
of  the  Mississippi.  And  f;  ;ther,  it  is  navigable  for 
n':arly  half  its  length,  680  miles  up  to  Wady  Haifa,  and 
ag: in  900  miles  from  iihe  rixth  cataract  to  Gondokoro. 

There  -ire  three  main  stream:,  that  form  the  Nile — 
the  White,  the  Blue,  and  th^  Black  Nile.  All  have 
helped  to  form  the  delta  of  Egypt.  The  Black  Nile 
brings  dovni  black  volcanic  plant-food  from  the 
Abyssinian  pl_  teau,  which  cr^uses  the  river  to  shine. 
The  White  Nile  contributes  organic  matter  and  slime, 
while  the  Blue  Nile  hurls  down  gra'.'el,  the  stones  of 
which  are  caught  by  the  cataracts.  So  great  an 
amount  of  deposit  is  brought  down,  that  the  water 
flowing  past  Cairo  contains  y^-oth  part  mud,  not  to 
mention  deposits  strewn  over  4000  miles.  Sir  John 
Stokes  says  that  the  sea  is  encroached  upon  at  Port  Said 
by  52  feet  each  year,  and  every  hundred  years  a  layer 
of  five  inches  of  mud  is  deposited  all  over  Lower 
Egypt,  16,000,000  tons  being  carried  down  in  sus- 
pension every  year. 

As  the  rise  and  fall  of  the  Nile  is  the  chief  topic 
of  conversation  in  Egypt,  we  should  know  that  an 
average  rise  is  between  22  and  25  feet.  Anything 
o'^er  27  feet  is  destructive,  and  under  22  insufficient. 
The  rise  is  caused  by  Abyssinian  floods  in  the  month 
of  May,  which,  according  to  Sir  Samuel  Baker, 
suddenly  fill  the  dry  watercourses.  From  June  to 
September  the  floods  are  out,  but  by  January  the 
delta  dries  and  crops  spring  up.  The  area  of  irrigated 
land  has  been  grea';l\'  increased  by  the  Ibrahimieh 
Canal,  which  was  constructed  by  Mehemet  Ali  at 
enormous  cost,  and  has  already  paid  its  way. 

Turning  now  from  the  river  itself  to  the  countries 
through  which  it  flows,  we  come  to 

Egypt. — No  other  country  in  the'world  is  yet  known 
to  have  a  longer  history  than  that  of  Egypt.  It  is  the 
home  of  the  earliest  civilization  of  which  we  have  any 
record,  and  the  country  where  probably  the  art  of 
alphabetical  writing  was  first  invented.  At  a  time  when 
the  greater  part  of  the  world  was  peopled  by  savage 


38  AFRICA    WAITING 


tribes  the  old  Egyptians  were  skilled  in  agriculture,  in 
architecture,  and  other  arts,  and  even  in  the  science  of 
astronomy.  This  is  shown  by  the  way  in  which  the 
great  pyramid  of  Gizeh  is  set  with  its  sides  exactly 
facing  the  four  points  of  the  compass,  and  the  shaft  of 
its  gallery  pointing  to  the  position  in  the  heavens  that 
the  pole-star  then  occupied.  In  the  thousands  of 
years  which  have  since  elcjpsed,  the  country  was  first 
ruled  by  a  succession  of  native  dynasties,  and  after- 
wards fell  under  the  dominion  of  one  foreign  nation 
after  another.  Persians,  Greeks,  Eomans,  Arabs,  and 
Turks  have  in  turn  held  sway,  and  Egypt  still  remains 
a  subject  nation. 

The  natural  boundaries  01  the  land  are  sea  and 
desert.  From  the  Mediterranean  to  Dongola,  across 
the  Nubian  desert,  is  a  stretch  of  nearly  1000  miles, 
happily  soon  to  be  bridged  by  a  railway  from  end  to 
end.  And  yot  the  area  fit  for  cultivation  is  actually 
only  about  two-thirds  larger  than  Yorkshire  !  Within 
this  area  dwell  nearly  7,000,000  people,  all  dependent 
on  the  Nile  for  crops.  The  chief  products  of  the  land 
are  wheat,  maize,  and  cotton  in  Lower  Egypt,  but  dates 
and  gums  higher  up  the  river  Alexandria  to-day  is 
the  centre  of  commerce,  and,  under  British  protection, 
the  condition  of  the  native  Fellahin  has  much  im- 
proved. Cairo,  **  the  most  Mohammedan  city  in  the 
world,"  not  even  excepting  Mecca  itself,  boasts  of 
500  mosques,  and  of  the  great  Mohammedan  uni- 
versity of  Al  Azhar.  There  have  been  as  many  as 
10,000  students  here  at  one  time,  that  have  come  from 
all  parts  of  the  Moslem  world.  This  is  undoubtedly 
the  very  stronghold  of  Islam.  Cairo  is  also  the  place 
of  concourse  for  pilgrims  on  their  way  to  Mecca,  which 
accounted  for  its  having  been  a  great  slave-market 
until  British  occupation  in  1882.- 

Egypt  is  divided  into  two  provinces,  known  as  Lower 
and  IJpper  Egypt  respectively.  Lower  Egypt  in- 
cludes only  a  small  part  of  the  Nile  Valley,  but  em- 
braces a  large  area  of  the  Fayum  to  the  west.  Upper 
Egypt  has,  since  1885,  included  a  portion  of  the  old 
province  of  Nubia,  which  was  retained  when  the  rest 


NORTH  AFRICA^   EGYPT,   AND   ABYSSINIA  39 

of  the  southern  provinces  were  left  to  the  Mahdi,  and 
has  been  further  enlarged,  in  1896,  by  the  re-conquest 
of  the  province  of  Dongola. 

The  most  striking  remains  of  the  ancient  civilization 
of  the  country  are  the  huge  pyramids,  and  the  equally 
wonderful  Sphinx.  Stupendous  ruins  of  ancient 
cities,  with  temples,  colonnades,  and  other  vast 
structures,  are  to  be  seen  on  the  sites  of  Memphis, 
Thebes,  and  other  spots  along  the  valley  as  far  as 
the  so-called  island  of  Meroe,  between  the  Black  and 
the  Blue  Nile. 

Following  the  Blue  Nile  to  its  sources  we  come  to 

Abyssinia. — The  Ethiopian  hill  country  used  to  be 
called  Habesh,  whence  Abessinia.  It  has  two  main 
approaches  by  the  way  of  the  Blue  Nile  or  by  Massowa, 
an  island  on  the  Red  Sea,  now  owned  by  Italy.  None 
of  its  mountain  torrents  are  navigable,  and  all  flow 
into  the  Nile,  hence  the  independence  of  the  country. 
Some  of  its  table-lands  are  over  10,000  feet  high,  and 
extend  as  far  as  from  the  Tyrol  to  the  Baltic,  while 
the  mountains  of  Semen  equal  Mont  Blanc  in 
height.  The  climate  i3  similar  to  that  of  Quito,  and 
vegetation  abounds.  Numbers  of  wild  animals  are 
indigenous, — the  elephant,  rhinoceros,  giraffe,  lion, 
hyena,  and  leopard.  The  baboon,  crocodile,  and 
hippopotamus  are  also  found.  Such  is  the  country 
that  served  as  a  refuge  to  Eastern  Christianity. 

Districts. — First  comes  Tigr6  with  the  ancient  capital 
of  Axum,  and  Adowa  the  modern  capital.  Secondly, 
Amhara  and  Godjam  with  their  capital  Gondar.  The 
famous  Magdala  is  a  mountain  fortress  on  the  southern 
frontier.  Thirdly,  Shoa  with  its  capital  Ankober  on  a 
high  mountain. 

Peoples. — The  complexions  of  the  people  vary  from 
very  dark  to  light  brown,  and  they  have  noble  features 
and  lofty  foreheads.  Connexion  with  Arabia  is  proved 
by  language.  One-third  of  the  vocabulary  is  Arabic, 
and  the  grammar  entirely  so.  The  written  characters 
are  also  of  Semitic  origin.  The  people  claim  to  be 
descendants  of  Abraham.  Certainly  monotheism 
existed  before  Christianity  entered,  and  they  have  no 


40  AFRICA    WAITING 


temples,  images,  or  statues.  Neither  here  nor  among 
the  dark  Gallas  to  the  south  are  traces  of  idols  to  be 
found. 

There  are  also  200,000  Falashas — or  black  Jews — 
dwelling  west  of  Gondar,  probably  descendants  of 
proselytes  to  the  Mosaic  faith. 

History. — The  story  of  jhe  conversion  of  Abyssinia 
to  Christianity  and  its  resistance  to  Papal  supremacy 
is  given  below.  From  the  very  first  the  peoples  have 
maintained  their  independence.  They  have  had  a 
mixed  race  of  kings,  most  notable  of  whom  was  King 
Theodore.  The  story  of  his  persecution  of  the  mis- 
sionaries, of  the  Abyssinian  campaign,  and  of  the 
storming  of  Magdala  in  1868  by  the  British  army  is 
a  by- word.  Since  then  King  John,  and  now  King 
Menelik  of  Shoa  rules  the  land.  In  1889  he 
accepted  the  "  mutual  protection  "  of  Italy.  But  the 
ultimate  fate  of  Abyssinia,  so  different  from  any  other 
native  state  in  Africa,  is  one  of  the  problems  of  the 
continent. 

Christianity  in  Egypt  and  Abyssinia, 

Ancient  Alexandria  soon  outstripped  Antioch  in 
becoming  the  missionary  centre  of  the  Early  Christian 
Church.  ''  As  the  meeting-place  of  Greek  philosophy, 
Jewish  thought,  Eoman  provincial  polity,  and  Oriental 
commerce,  Alexandria  became  the  intellectual  centre 
of  the  world,  just  as  Christianity  became  a  missionary 
faith.  From  the  school  of  Pantaenus  went  forth  mis- 
sionaries and  Christian  teachers  to  all  lands  from 
North-Western  and  Eastern  Africa  to  Arabia,  India, 
and  Ceylon,  while  Cosmas,  the  merchant-missionary, 
carried  Christian  influences  as  far  as  the  Malay  Archi- 
pelago." But  weakness  and  discord  set  in,  and  soon 
after  came  the  Arab  invasion  sweeping  all  before  it. 
Nubia  became  Moslem  to  a  man,  and  the  Christian 
Church  in  Egypt  was  shorn  of  its  former  strength  and 
comeliness.  Only  a  remnant  of  about  a  quarter  of 
a  million  Christians  survive  to-day,  with  a  sadly  igno- 
rant and  degraded  priesthood. 


NORTH  AFRICA^    EGYPT,   AND   ABYSSINIA  4I 

The  conversion  of  the  Abysyinians  is  due  to  Fru- 
mentius,  whom  Athanasius  a'opointed  first  '*  Abuna  " 
or  Bishop  of  Abyssinia  about  330  a.d.  The  story 
of  his  influence  with  the  emperor,  his  moderation  as 
Bishop  of  Ethiopia,  and  the  founding  of  this  ancient 
church  and  order  of  ministry  is  most  interesting. 
Like  the  Egyptian  Copts  their  creed  is  Monophysite, 
and  was  condemned  as  heretical  at  the  general  council 
of  Chalcedon.  The  Abyssinit^n  Church  is  the  only 
African  primitive  church  that  withstood  the  inroads  of 
Islam  in  the  7th  century. 

The  Coptic  Church,  both  inEgjrpt  and  Abyssinia, 
traces  its  origin  to  the  Apostle  Mark,  and  his  chair 
in  Alexandria.  Its  members  are  undoubtedly  descen- 
dants of  the  ancient  Egyptian  race,  which  was  Chris- 
tianized in  the  first  three  centuries  a.d.  They  now 
number  about  a  quarter  of  a  million  souls,  or  a  pro- 
portion of  one  to  every  twenty  Mohammedans.  The 
ancient  Coptic  language  is  deo^d,  and  has  been  super- 
seded by  the  Arrjbic  colloquial  of  to-day. 

A  sadly  corrupt  church  remains,  and  is  governed  by 
the  Patriarch  of  Alexandria,  who  resides,  and  has  con- 
siderable property,  in  Cairo.  He  is  chosen  by  lot  or 
by  the  nomination  of  his  predecessor,  and  always  from 
among  the  monks  of  St.  Anthony.  There  are  also 
twelve  bishops  and  a  metropolitan  appointed  for 
Abyssinia,  and  numerous  archpriests.  Every  priest 
must  be  over  thirty- three  years  of  age,  and  the 
husband  of  one  wife.  Priests  and  deacons  may  not 
marry  after  ordination.  Several  monks  and  nuns 
have  made  vows  of  celibacy. 

The  churches  are  divided  into  the  "  Heykel "  or 
chancel,  which  contains  the  altar,  where  also  the  service 
is  performed  in  Coptic ;  in  the  next  compartment, 
which  is  screened  off,  the  priest  reads  the  lessons,  the 
boys  serve  as  acolytes  and  singers,  and  the  chief 
members  of  the  congregation  sit ;  while  the  rest  of  the 
church  is  separated  by  wooden  lattice  work,  and  occu- 
pied by  inferior  members,  the  lowest  place  of  all  being 
given   to   the  women.     Rude  pictures   of   saints   are 


42  AFRICA    WAITING 


suspended,  but  no  images  are  admitted.  The  floor  is 
covered  with  mats.  The  turban  is  kept  on,  and  shoes 
are  taken  off.  Full  service  lasts  more  than  three  hours, 
and  the  priest  officiates  in  handsome  robes,  waving 
frankincense,  using  wafer  bread  moistened  with  wine 
for  the  sacrament,  but  often  behaving  most  un- 
becomingly. The  form  of  worship  and  chanting  is 
very  ancient. 

The  following  rites  are  observed.  Baptism  takes  place 
in  infancy,  with  a  belief  in  chrism.  Circumcision, 
generally  at  seven  or  eight  years  old,  is  commended. 
Prayers  are  offered  seven  times  a  day  as  by  the  Moslems, 
but  prayer  in  private  is  preferred.  Strict  and  literate 
Copts  repeat  the  whole  of  the  Psalms  through  every 
day  at  such  times.  Thus  prayers  are  often  repeated 
when  walking  or  riding.  Confession  is  required  of  all 
before  receiving  the  sacrament,  and  penances  are 
administered.  There  are  four  fasting  seasons  in  the 
year,  and  seven  festivals.  Abstinence  from  swine's 
flesh,  from  things  strangled  and  from  blood,  is  observed 
according  to  the  Mosaic  law. 

The  pilgrimage  to  Jerusalem  is  incumbent  upon  all 
who  can  go.  Passion  week  and  Easter  are  spent  in 
Jerusalem,  followed  by  a  bathe  in  Jordan.  Marriage 
festivities  last  eight  days,  Sunday  night  being  the 
favourite  time  for  the  service.  A  contract  is  made 
beforehand  in  the  presence  of  a  priest,  and  the  Lord's 
prayer  is  repeated  three  times  by  all  present.  The 
sacrament  is  always  received  at  the  marriage  service. 
At  funerals,  as  with  Moslems,  the  bier  is  followed  by 
wailing-women,  who  are  employed  (contrary  to  the 
wish  of  many  priests)  to  continue  wailing  for  three  days 
after  death.   Visits  are  paid  to  tombs  three  times  a  year. 

Abyssinian  ceremonies  differ  somewhat  from  those 
of  the  Copts  in  Egypt,  and  are  of  very  ancient  origin. 
Several  Jewish  practices  remain,  and  both  Sabbath 
and  Sunday  are  kept  holy  in  the  province  of  God  jam. 
Prayers  in  the  ancient  Ethiopic  are  both  solemn  and 
sublime,  while  the  primitive  custom  of  having  churches 
devoid  of    seats  and  **kneelers"  is  observed.       The 


NORTH  AFRICA^   EGYPT^  AND  ABYSSINIA  43 

congregation  stand  to  pray,  and  the  feeble  are 
supported  by  a  crutch  or  staff.  Preaching  is  not 
commanded,  and  is  seldom  heard.  At  the  Lord's 
Supper  the  elements  consist,  as  in  the  Greek  Church, 
of  ordinary  bread  and  the  unfermented  juice  of  the 
grape.  In  war  the  "  Tabot,"  or  wooden  slab  on  the 
altar,  is  consecrated  and  carried  about.  Prayers  for 
those  asleep  in  Christ  (not  in  purgatory)  are  offered, 
and  absolution  is  pronounced  over  the  dead.  The 
Virgin  Mary  has  a  high  ofl&ce,  some  think  the  work  of 
redemption  is  attributable  to  her.  There  are  traces  of 
strict  discipline  observed  long  ago,  and  pubHc  confes- 
sion of  sin.  No  Christian  people  on  earth  are  so  rigid 
in  their  fasting.  The  Abyssinians  fast,  in  all,  nine 
months  out  of  the  twelve.  Yet  immorality  is  the  order 
of  the  day,  and  even  priests  and  monks  break  the 
seventh  commandment.  Marriage  is  seldom  con- 
ducted in  church,  and  is  simply  a  civil  contract. 
Superstition  is  immeasurably  great,  and  the  Lebashi 
(thief-catcher)  is  much  to  be  feared.  Such  in  brief 
is  the  condition  of  Abyssinia. 

Romish  Missions.  —  Isolated  from  the  rest  of 
Christendom,  and  stationary  therefore  in  doctrine  and 
usages,  Abyssinia  was  at  length  rediscovered  by  way 
of  the  Cape,  under  King  John  II.  of  Portugal  in  1490. 
He  at  once  courted  friendly  relations  with  its  emperor 
Claudius.  Claudius  would  not,  however,  acknowledge 
the  supremacy  of  the  Pope,  but  declared  him  a  heretic 
and  refused  to  receive  one  Bermudes,  a  Portuguese, 
appointed  as  Patriarch  of  Ethiopia  by  the  Pope.  Two 
missions  of  the  Jesuits  were  sent  by  way  of  Goa  to 
win  over  Abyssinia  to  the  Catholic  faith  !  In  the  first, 
according  to  Jesuit  admission,  they  were  worsted 
in  controversy  by  the  enlightened  Claudius,  and 
Bishop  Oviedo  was  recalled  by  a  Papal  bull  in  1560. 
In  the  second  mission  the  Abyssinian  doctors  were 
worsted,  and  the  Eoman  fathers  triumphant.  Where- 
upon the  Abuna  took  up  arms  against  the  emperor. 
Constant  wars,  and  incessant  intrigues,  with  hardly 
a  parallel  in  history,  brought    the    Papal  cause  into 


44  AFRICA    WAITING 


ascendency.  The  Abyssinian  peasants  rose  in  arms  and 
were  slaughtered  by  the  aid  of  heathen  Gallas.  After  two 
appeals  the  party  that  favoured  Alexandria  as  against 
Eome  caused  the  emperor  to  issue  a  proclamation  in 
Council  in  1632,  restoring  the  religion  of  their  fore- 
fathers. The  Eoman  fathers  then  made  their  escape, 
thus  ending  the  mediaeval  history  of  Abyssinia. 

Protestant  Missions. — The  work  of  modern  mis- 
sions was  begun  among  the  Copts,  both  ir  Figypt  and 
Abyssinia,  by  the  Church  Missionary  Society.  *'  It 
was  thought  that  they  might  be  raised  to  self- 
reformation,  and  that  then  througli  them  (the  Coptic 
Church)  the  Gospel  might  be  spread  among  the 
Mohammedanc."  The  abla  missionary  Jowett,  Fellow 
of  St.  John's  College,  Cambridge,  and  six  years  later 
five  students  (one  of  them  Samuel  Gobat),  from  Basle 
seminary,  were  sent  out  to  promote  this  object.  Their 
work  teems  \nth.  interest  even  to-day.  Jowett  managed 
to  purchase  for  the  Bible  Society  a  remarkable  manu« 
script  translcjtion  of  the  Bible  in  Amharic..  made  by 
the  monk  Abu  Eumi.  The  revised  version  of  this  work 
was  finished  by  Krapf  before  his  deajh. 

By  Bible  distribution,  and  personal  conversation 
with  the  Coptic  Patriarchs  and  clergy,  good  work  was 
done.  In  1830,  Gobat  bo^an  a  mission  in  Abyssinia, 
which  was  carried  on  for  wight  years  by  Isenb^rg  and 
others ;  but  visible  result::  were  small  beyond  the 
circulation  of  many  thousand  copies  of  Scripture  in 
the  Amharic  vernacular.  Krapf  joined  the  mission  in 
1837,  only  to  be  expelled  with  the  others  the  next 
year,  owing  to  the  hostile  influence  of  two  French 
Eomish  priests.  He  afuerwards  spent  three  years  in 
Shoa,  then  a  kingdom  lying  south  of  i^byssinia,  and 
also  nominally  Christian.  But  from  here,  after  a 
temporary  absence,  he  was  again  excluded  through 
Eomish  influence.  Therefore  with  his  heart  set  on 
reaching  the  Gallas,  he  sailed  down  the  East  Coast 
to  Mombasa  and  Zanzibar,  thence  to  begin  those 
explorations  which  called  the  attention  of  Europe  to 
the  great  lakes  of  Africa. 


NORTH  AFR/CAj    EGYPT^   AND   ABYSSINIA  45 

There  is  only  room  just  to  mention  the  remarkable 
^^  Pilgrim  Mission,"  which  was  to  begin  the  **  chain  of 
missions"  from  north  to  south,  called  Apostles'  Street. 
It  was  started  by  Krapf ,  but  abandoned  for  want  of 
support.  Agc^in,  the  work  of  the  Swedish  Lutherans 
in  Massowrj,  and  o.  Mr.  .?lad  among  the  Falasha 
Jews  cannot  be  pas::ed  over.  No  missionaries  are 
allowed  in  Abyssinia  to-day,  and  therefore  special 
prayer  should  be  maae  for  this  ancient  lando 

The  principal  mission  in  Egypt  now  is  that  of  the 
American  United  Presbyterians.  Its  work  is  chiefly 
among  the  CopoS,  from  whom  its  plan  is  to  gain 
proseiytes,  and  so  to  obtain  a  pure  Eeformed  Church. 
In  this  connexion  the  names  of  Dr.  Lansing  and  Mr. 
Hogg  will  always  be  remembered.  Its  chief  centres 
are  at  Cairo,  Assiut,  and  Assuan.  Begun  in  1854,  it 
has  been  greatly  blessed  to  the  Coptic  Church,  and 
even  the  Mohammedan  population,  for  from  the 
latter  1000  children  are  found  in  mission-schools. 
At  the  -nd  of  forty  year:'  work,  it  has  preached  the 
Gospel  at  nearly  150  points  in  the  long,  nn-_r:  ■  valley 
of  the  Nile,  and  the  college  in  Assiut  has  sent  out 
over  100  Egyptian  Christian  schoolmasters  into  the 
villages.  Latest  returns  give  the  mission  41  American 
workers  and  31  native  licentiates. 

It  was  not  till  1865  that  the  original  C.M.S.  mission 
to  Egypt  came  to  an  end.  About  the  same  time  the 
late  Miss  Whately  commenced  her  devoted  .jud  most 
valuable  school-work  in  Cairo,  designed  especially  for 
Mohammedan  boys  and  girls,  which  at  great  cost  to 
herself  was  continued  for  nearly  thirty  years  till  her 
death  in  1889.  To  her  frequent  appeals  for  an  English 
Church  missionary  to  be  sent  to  Cairo  the  C.M.S. 
responded  in  1882,  the  year  of  British  occupi^tion  of 
Egypt,  and  the  Eev.  F.  A.  Klein,  a  ripe  Arabic  scholar, 
began  the  work,  followed  by  Dr.  Harpur's  Medical 
Mission  seven  years  later.  The  staff  has  now  largely 
increased,  and  much  literary,  medical,  and  women's 
work  has  been  done. 

A  word  in  closing  about  the  extent  of  Bible  circulation.

CHAPTEE  IV. 

NEGKO-LAND  :  THE  GEEAT  SUDAN. 

The  purpose  of  this  chapter  is  gradually  to  bring  the 
vast  fields  within  the  populous  and  tropical  Sudan  before 
our  notice.  We  shall  begin  by  confining  our  attention 
to  the  coast  regions  and  study  their  history  and  de- 
velopment. Then  it  is  proposed  to  follow  some  Sudan 
explorers  into  the  interior,  and  to  hear  from  them 
accounts  of  many  native  states.  And  finally  the 
efforts  to  bring  the  Gospel  to  West  Africa  will  be 
reviewed. 

As  soon  as  the  deserts  of  Sahara  are  crossed,  a  more 
fertile  zone  is  reached.  Like  the  desert  to  the 
north,  it  stretches  from  the  Senegal  to  the  Nile,  and 
reaches  southwards  to  the  Gulf  of  Guinea  in  the  west 
and  to  the  high  table-land  of  Central  Africa  in  the  east. 
The  inhabitants  change  with  the  country,  and  the 
Semitic  and  Hamitic  races,  belonging  to  the  white 
division  of  mankind,  give  place  to  the  black,  or  Negro 
race.  On  account  of  the  dark  colour  of  the  people,  this 
region  became  known  to  the  dwellers  in  North  Africa 
as  "  Bilad-es-Sudan,"  or,  the  country  of  the  Blacks, 
which  in  turn  has  been  shortened  to  "  Sudan." 

The  Sudan  falls  naturally  into  two  main  divisions, 
the  West  and  the  East  Sudan.  The  West  Sudan 
includes  all  the  unhealthy  countries  bordering  the 
Guinea  Coast,  as  far  south  as  the  Equator,  and  behind 
them  the  vast  interior  lands  bordering  the  course  of 
the    Niger    and    its    tributaries.     The   East   Sudan 


4$  AFRICA    WAITING 


stretches  from  Lake  Chad  up  to  the  Biver  Nile,  in- 
cluding part  of  the  regions  of  the  Bahr-el-Ghazal  and 
its  tributaries. 

Mention  has  already  been  made  of  Portuguese 
voyages  along  the  west  coast  of  Africa.  Step  by  step 
they  made  their  way  into  the  unknown  south  to  find  a 
new  route  to  the  East  by  sea.  They  passed  Cape  Verd 
in  1445,  Sierra  Leone  in  1461,  and  the  Equator  in 
1470.  But  the  antiquity  of  their  early  settlements 
must  be  fully  appreciated.  The  fort  of  Elmina  was 
built  by  them  in  1481,  almost  exactly  a  hundred  years 
before  Sir  Humphrey  Gilbert  annexed  Newfoundland, 
which  is  commonly  regarded  as  the  oldest  British 
colony.  And  it  was  more  than  300  years  before  any 
European  settlement  was  planted  in  AustraUa. 

\Vest  Africa. — When  the  New  Wcrld  was  dis- 
covered, West  Africa  was  sacrificed  to  America.  At 
the  outset  we  would  like,  therefore,  to  point  out  some 
points  of  contrast  and  connexion  between  the  two. 
Firstly,  the  celebrated  papal  Bull  of  1493  marked  ofi 
the  eastern  world  for  the  Portuguese  and  the  western 
world  for  the  Spaniards,  so  that  at  first  each  nation  ran 
a  different  course.  Next,  while  the  West  Indian  islands 
have  comparatively  a  healthy  climate,  the  West  African 
coast  is  notoriously  unhealthy  for  white  men,  and  even 
its  native  inhabitants  suffer  constantly  from  malaria. 
Hence,  while  the  West  Indies  became  a  sphere  of 
European  settlement,  and  one  of  the  very  few  tropical 
parts  of  the  world  where  colonists  from  Great  Britain 
have  made  a  home,  the  west  coast  of  Africa  from  first 
to  last  has  been  hardly  suitable  even  for  temporary 
residence. 

Again,  West  Indian  colonies  have  always  been  colo- 
nies of  produce.  Sugar  has  become  almost  a  universal 
product,  and  the  result  of  slavery  was  to  extend,  though 
at  the  same  time  to  stereotype  the  cultivation  of  the 
ground.  West  Africa,  on  the  contrary,  though  produc- 
ing gold,  palm  oil,  and  jungle  productSp  has,  as  a  whole, 
no  definite  system  of  cultivation,  no  regular  agricul- 
tural settlements  and  no  mining  centres. 


NEGRO-LAND:    THE    GREAT  SUDAN  49 

Further,  slavery  in  the  West  Indies  promoted  culti- 
vatioi:  within  certain  limits,  but  retarded  it  in  West 
Africa.  The  discovery  of  America  converted  the 
African  coast  into  a  great  hunting  ground  for  labour 
demanded  by  the  American  colonies.  It  was  impos- 
sible to  develop  a  part  of  the  world  which  was  per- 
petually being  drained  of  its  labour  supply ;  or  to 
build  up  agricultural  communities  and  to  carry  on 
legitimate  trade  at  the  same  time  that  war  was  en- 
couraged in  order  to  obtain  slaves,  villages  were  burnt, 
and  their  inhabitants  either  killed  or  transported. 

Once  more,  West  Africa  was  more  a  place  of  passage 
than  the  West  Indies.  Its  coasts  were  explored  to  find 
a  way  to  the  East.  On  the  other -hand,  it  was  far  from 
the  East,  and  the  more  scientific  navigation  became, 
the  more  men  passed  it  by,  as  being  a  little  off  the 
straight  road.  So  in  great  measure  its  first  owners 
neglected  it,  and  the  only  permanent  element  in  its 
history  was  the  slave  trade,  which  made  it  less  than 
ever  a  final  resting-place,  and  more  than  ever  a  part  of 
the  world  to  be  raided,  devastated,  and  left. 

Early  European  Enterprise. 

There  have  been  four  other  European  nations  besides 
the  Portuguese  that  in  times  past  have  sought  to  gain 
a  sohd  footing  in  West  Africa.  The  French  claim  to 
have  been  there  first  of  all,  and  were  always  regarded 
as  dangerous  intruders  by  the  Portuguese.  When 
the  shade  of  rehgious  persecution  grew  darker  over 
France,  it  was  natural  that  many  Norman,  Breton,  and 
Huguenot  sailors  should  turn  their  eyes  to  foreign 
lands.  But  the  French  traders  always  confined 
themselves  to  Senegal.  "  In  all  places  (they)  were 
beloved,  and  as  courteously  entertained  of  the 
Negroes  as  if  they  had  been  naturally  born -in  the 
country." 

The  English  next  began  to  reconnoitre  off  West 
Africa,  and  it  is  satisfactory  to  find  that  slave-catching 
was  not  a  feature  of  those  early  voyages.  Guinea 
pepper,  ivory,  and  gold  were  sought  for,  and  the  year 

E 


5b  AFRICA    WAITING 


of  the  Spanish  Armada  marks  the  date  of  incorporation 
of  the  first  EngUsh  company  to  trade  with  this  coast. 
The  expeditions  of  Thompson  and  Jobson  up  the 
Gambia  are  interesting  reading,  as  being  the  first 
attempts  by  Europeans  to  reach  the  Niger  and  the  far- 
famed  Timbuctu.  In  this  they  were  a  hundred  years 
in  advance  of  the  Frenchmen,  Andr6  Briie  and 
Compagnon. 

No  sooner  had  the  Dutch  become  united  and  pro- 
claimed  their  independence,  than  they  followed  suii. 
They  were  welcomed  by  the  natives,  as  the  bearers 
of  better  and  cheaper  goods  than  those  of  the  Portu- 
guese. Having  shrewdly  formed  themselves  into  one 
Dutch  West  India  Company  to  trade  with  America 
and  West  Africa,  they  first  came  into  conflict  with  the 
Portuguese  in  Brazil,  then  drove  them  out  of  the  Gold 
Coast,  and  took  their  place.  The  last  comers  of  any 
importance  were  the  Dams.  Their  strongholds  of 
Christiansborg  and  Fredericksborg  (now  known  as 
Danish  Mount)  still  witness  to  the  influence  they 
exercised  over  the  eastern  half  of  the  present  Gold 
Coast  Colony.  But  in  1850  they  sold  their  possessions 
to  Great  Britain. 

The  17th,  18th,  and  19th  centuries  have  been  spent 
in  a  fight  for  supremacy  among  the  nations.  North 
of  the  Gulf  of  Guinea  competition  has  been  from 
first  to  last  between  France  and  Great  Britain.  On 
the  Guinea  Coast  itself,  the  Dutch  were  rivals  to 
Britain  till  twenty  years  ago. 

Development  of  \Vest  Africa.  —  Before  the 
eighteenth  century  had  quite  passed  away,  two  events 
occurred  in  West  Africa,  which  were  signs  of  a 
growing  desire  for  Africa's  redemption.  In  1787,  the 
same  year  in  which  the  first  British  colonists  were 
sent  to  Australia,  a  beginning  was  made  of  a  settlement 
at  Sierra  Leone.  As  far  back  as  1773,  Samuel  Hopkins 
in  America  had  originated  a  scheme  for  the  re- 
patriation of  Africans.  This  was  followed  up  by  the 
philanthropic  efforts  of  Clarkson,  Wilberforce,  and 
Granville  Sharp,  in  England,  who*  formed  a  voluntary 


NEGRO-LAND  :    THE   GREAT  SUDAN  5 1 

"  committee  for  relieving  the  black  poor  "  who,  as  a 
result  of  Lord  Mansfield's  judgment  in  1772,i  had  been 
turned  adrift  in  London,  to  the  number  of  14,000. 

The  settlement  of  the  peninsula  of  Sierra  Leone 
was  chosen,  and  bought  from  the  natives.  And 
though  the  colony  for  the  first  three  years  was  a  great 
failure,  yet  its  re-establishment  in  1791  under  the 
name  of  Freetown,  and  its  progress  under  the 
governorship  of  Zachary  Macaulay,  were  a  real  success. 
Moreover  it  was  the  first-fruits  of  colonization,  as 
opposed  to  the  old  fort  and  factory  system  with  its 
private  trade,  and  the  first  step  to  the  development 
and  opening  up  of  Africa. 

The  forming  of  the  African  Association,  in  1788, 
to  promote  discovery,  was  the  second  important  step ; 
and  when  in  1795  it  secured  the  services  of  Mungo 
Park,  it  had  found  the  father  of  modern  African 
exploration,  and  the  first  of  Europeans  to  reach  the 
upper  waters  of  the  Niger. 

A  Century  of  Exploration :  The  Svdan.^ 

The  first  problem  which  the  newly-formed  Associa- 
tion took  in  hand  was  that  of  the  course  of  the  Niger. 
Though  mentioned  by  Ptolemy  (and  possibly  even 
referred  to  by  Herodotus)  under  that  name,  endless 
speculations  were  made  as  to  whether  it  flowed  east- 
wards to  the  Nile,  or  westwards  to  the  Senegal,  or  into 
a  lake  in  the  centre  of  the  continent.  The  first 
decisive  result  was  obtained  by  Mungo  Park,  who 
reached  the  Upper  Niger  from  the  Senegal  (1796) 
after  thrilling  adventures,  and  proved  its  easterly 
direction  by  actual  observation.  On  a  second  journey 
(1805)  he  descended  the  stream  yet  farther  into  the 
interior,  and  passed  close  to  Timbuctu.  But  his 
canoe  ran  upon  a  rock  at  Bussa  in  the  presence  of 
hostile  natives,  he   and  four   European   companions

52  AFRICA    WAITING 


were  drowned,  and  the  problem  as  to  the  termination 
of  the  Niger  remained  unsolved.  In  1822-4  the  great 
expedition  of  Denham,  Oudney,  and  Clapper  ton  crossed 
the  Sahara  and  discovered  Lake  Chad  and  the  mouth 
of  its  main  feeder,  the  Shari.  In  1825  Major  Laing 
succeeded  in  reaching  Timbuctu  from  the  north,  and 
gained  the  credit  of  being  the  first  European  of  whose 
visit  anything  is  known,  but  he  was  shortly  afterwards 
murdered  in  revenge  for  natives  whom  Park  had 
killed.  Three  years  later  the  Frenchman  Caille 
reached  the  same  town  from  the  south-west,  and 
successfully  returned,  after  crossing  the  desert  and  the 
Atlas  range  to  Tangier s,  to  publish  the  news  all  over 
Europe.  These  journeys  paved  the  way  for  a  final 
solution  of  the  Niger  problem.  For  Captain  Clapperton 
went  back  to  the  Sudan  in  1825-7,  by  way  of  the 
Gulf  of  Guinea  ;  and  though  he  died  without  actually 
tracing  the  river  to  the  sea,  his  servant,  Bichard  Lander, 
returned  in  1830  and  verified  its  connection  with  the 
streams  on  the  Benin  coast,  as  suggested,  even  in 
1802,  by  a  German  savant  named  Eeichard.  No 
sooner  had  this  problem  been  solved  and  these  parts 
of  the  Sahara  and  Sudan  been  explored,  than  the 
African  Association  was  merged  into  the  newly-formed 
Eoyal  Geographical  Society  in  1831. 

The  only  Other  Sudan  Explorations  made  before 
1850  were  those  of  Mehemet  AH's  expeditions  up  the 
White  Nile  in  1840-1,  the  second  of^  which  reached 
4°.  42'.  N.  latitude.  In  March,  1850,  however, 
Richardson,  accompanied  by  two  German  volunteers, 
Earth  and  Overweg,  set  out  from  Tripoli  via  the 
Murzuk  and  Air  route  to  the  Sudan.  He  died, 
however,  in  Bornu,  leaving  Earth,  the  antiquarian, 
and  Overweg,  the  astronomer,  to  pursue  their  instruc- 
tions. But  Overweg  also  died  by  the  shores  of 
Lake  Chad,  which  he  was  the  first  to  navigate ;  thus 
Barth  was  left  single-handed  for  four  years,  during 
which  time  he  traversed  the  Central  Sudan  in  all 
directions,  studying  the  physical,  political,  and  social 
aspects  of  the  country.  These  he  described  on  his 
return,  in  one  of  the  best  books,  even  to-day,  in  African 


NEGRO- LAN D  :     THE   GREAT  SUDAN  53 

literature.  During  this  period  he  reached  from  the 
north  the  Benu6,  the  great  eastern  tributary  of  the 
Niger  (shortly  after  ascended  from  the  sea  by 
Dr.  Baikie) ;  crossed  the  Shari  and  visited  the  capital 
of  Bagirmi,  and  finally  made  his  way  to  Timbuctu, 
returning  along  the  Middle  Niger.  This  region  was 
not  visited  by  any  other  traveller  for  forty  years. 

To  complete  the  list,  Yogel  followed  Heinrich  Barth 
across  the  Sahara  (1854),  but  died  in  Wadai.  In  1866 
Gerard  Bohlfs,  who  wrote  so  attractively  on  Morocco, 
made  his  way  across  the  Sudan  to  Lagos ;  while 
three  years  later  (1869-74)  Nachtigal  explored  the 
Tibesti  highlands  and  the  depression  north  of  Lake 
Chad,  then  travelled  to  the  south  of  the  lake,  and 
returned  by  an  easterly  route  through  Wadai,  thus 
supplying  the  connecting  link  between  the  Central 
Sudan  and  the  Nile  basin.  The  next  to  cross  the 
desert  was  Lenz,  who  in  1880  reached  Timbuctu  from 
Morocco,  while  Manteucci  and  Massari  crossed  over 
from  Suakin  to  the  mouth  of  the  Niger  (1880-1). 
Lastly,  Captain  Binger  (1887-8)  filled  up  some  gaps 
between  the  Upper  Niger  and  the  Ivory  Coast,  and 
Meistre  (1892-3)  was  the  first  to  cross  the  watershed 
between  the  Nile  and  Chad  basins,  by  starting  from 
the  Mobangi  and  descending  down  the  Shari  to 
Bagirmi. 

Inhabitants  of  the  Sudan. 

From  explorers,  traders,  and  missionaries  it  is  for 
the  first  time  known  that  there  are  two  distinct 
climates  in  West  Africa  and  the  Sudan.  The  one  in 
the  coast  regions,  which  are  mostly  covered  with 
forests  ;  subject  to  a  moist  and  equable  climate,  and 
deadly  to  white  men.  The  other  in  the  basin  of 
the  Niger,  drier,  more  fertile,  and  better  cultivated ; 
bounded  on  the  south  by  extensive  forests  ;  countries 
bringing  forth  corn  and  cotton,  beans  and  rice,  indigo 
and  vegetables. 

Corresponding  to  these  different  climates  are  also 
found  two  different  types  of  the  Negro  race.  The 
Pure  Negroes  inhabit  the  coast  lands,  and  are  split 


54  AFRICA    WAITING 


ap  into  a  variety  of  tribes,  which  are  estimated  by 
Dr.  Gust  as  speaking  not  less  than  150  distinct 
languages.  Among  those  speaking  the  *'  Tshi  "  and 
the  "Evhe  "  languages  respectively,  are  the  states  of 
Ashanti  and  Dahomey,  which  have  only  lately  fallen 
under  European  influence.  They  have  been  the  home 
of  debasing  superstitions  (vide  ch.  II.),  and  ghastly 
human  sacrifices  have  been  a  regular  institution  down 
to  the  present  day.  The  people  of  Yoruba  are,  how- 
ever, a  superior  race,  and  extend  over  the  compara- 
tively open  plains  west  of  the  Lower  Niger.  With 
Ilorin  as  a  capital,  now  under  the  Eoyal  Niger 
Company,  they  once  formed  a  powerful  empire.  The 
Kru,  who  dwell  near  Cape  Palmas,  are  of  Mandingan 
stock,  and  are  a  powerful  and  energetic  race,  largely 
employed  as  labourers  ("kru-boys")  along  the  coast, 
and  as  crews  of  European  trading  vessels. 

The  Mixed  Races  are  found  on  the  open  plateaux 
of  the  interior.  They  are  hardy  and  energetic,  much 
given  to  trade,  agriculture,  and  cattle-rearing,  and 
contrast  strongly  with  the  generally  passive  and 
superstitious  natives  of  the  forest-clad  lowlands.  Thus 
the  interior  lands,  from  being  brought  into  contact 
with  the  northern  races,  have  long  been  the  home  of  a 
higher  degree  of  civilization  than  the  coast  lands,  even  the 
Negroes  having  to  a  large  extent  adopted  the  religion — 
and  with  it  a  certain  capacity  for  political  organization 
— of  the  invaders  of  the  north.  The  most  important 
of  these  mixed  races  are  the  Fulahs,  who  from  being 
cattle-rearers  in  the  Futa  Jallon  highlands,  have  now, 
almost  everywhere  as  far  as  Lake  Chad,  become  the 
masters  of  the  rest  of  the  inhabitants,  including  the 
Hausas — a  race  of  born  traders  dwelling  between  the 
Niger  and  Lake  Chad. 

Other  races  of  the  plateau  are  more  like  the  Negro 
type.  The  Wolofs,  intensely  black,  dwell  between 
the  Senegal  and  the  Gambia.  The  Mandingos, 
formerly  a  ruling  race,  are  now  widely  spread  along 
the  southern  border  of  the  plateau,  especially  near  the 
Upper  Niger.     They  are  mostly  subject  to  the  Fulahs 


NEGRO-LAND :     THE   GREAT  SUDAN  55 

The  Songrhay,  who  were  a  powerful  race  before  the 
rise  of  the  Fulahs,  dwell  on  the  Midcle  Niger,  east 
of  Timjuctu,  on  the  borders  of  the  Sahara.  The 
Kanuri,  in  the  Lake  Chad  basin,  are  also  of  Negro- 
Hamitic  type.  Within  the  bend  of  the  Niger  the 
Nogro  states  of  Mosi  and  Borga  (or  Bussa)  have  so 
far  maintained  their  independence  apart  from  northern 
influences,  and,  according  to  Monteil,  are  fairly  civil- 
ized. The  Gurunga,  on  the  Upper  Volta,  are  like- 
wise Negroes  and  Pagans. 

Their  Occupations  and  Trade. — As  a  general 
rule  the  Negro  inhabitants  of  the  coast  lands  are 
agriculturists,  growing  the  banana  in  large  quantities,  as 
well  as  corn,  while  in  the  interior  both  agriculture  and 
cattle-rearing  are  practised.  TJhc  dominant  Fulahs  are 
hcrdcnen,  and  outside  their  domain  it  is  usually  Arabs, 
or  thor:e  nearest  akin  to  them,  who  are  engaged  in  this 
way,  while  the  Negroid  peoples  are  cultivators  and 
traders.  The  Hausas  are  the  great  trading  people  of 
the  Sudan,  and  their  language  is  the  general  medium 
of  intercourse  from  the  Senegal  to  the  Shari,  as  well  as 
in  part  of  the  Sahara.  They  are  also  largely  recruited 
as  police  by  Em'opean  powers  on  the  Gulf  of  Guinea. 
In  the  Negro  zone  the  Yorubans  are  active  traders,  but 
hitherto  the  long-established  trade  routes  with  the 
Sudan  have  passed  from  east  to  west,  connecting  the 
various  countries  in  the  plateau  zone,  and  not  from 
north  to  south.  The  reason  for  this  is  the  difficulty  of 
travelling  through  the  forest  zone,  the  rivers  being  often 
the  only  feasible  routes,  and  few  of  these  are  really  im- 
portant highways.  Even  the  Niger  is  only  now  becom- 
ing, in  European  hands,  an  important  approach  to  the 
interior.  The  great  native  trading  centres  lie  either 
near  the  border  of  the  Sahara  at  the  termini  of  the 
desert  routes,  or  near  the  southern  edge  of  the  plateau 
just  beyond  the  forests  of  the  coast. 

Native  States. 

Sokoto  and  Dependencies. — SoTcoto,  occupying 
a  great  part  of  the  space  between  the  Niger  and  Laka 


^6  AFRICA    WATTING 


Chad,  :'■:  the  modern  representative  of  the  Fulah 
kingdom.  The  city  of  Sokoto  has  since  been  re- 
placed as  a  capital  by  Wurnu,  twenty  miles  higher 
up  the  river  of  Sokoto,  and  many  of  the  Hausa  towns 
are  almost  independent  of  the  central  authority, 
only  paying  a  yearly  tribute.  Kano,  south-east  of 
Sokoto,  is  the  commercial  capital  of  the  central  Sudan, 
being  the  terminus  of  one  of  the  principal  routes 
across  the  Sahara.  It  manufactures  blue  cotton  cloth 
(exported  to  many  parts  of  the  Sahara  and  Sudan), 
and  leather  goods.  Its  wares  include  gold  dust, 
ivory,  slaves,  salt,  natron,  earthenware,  and  many 
other  commodities.  When  the  caravans  arrive  from 
distant  parts  its  streets  are  thronged  with  merchants, 
and  the  population  rises  at  least  to  60,000.  Other 
important  centres  are  Katsena,  north-west  of  Kano ; 
Zaria,  south-west  of  Kano ;  and  Yakoba  (said  to  be 
even  larger  than  Kano),  Gombe,  Muri,  and  Kefifi,  in 
the  more  southern  parts  of  the  kingdom. 

The  state  of  Gando  stretches  along  the  Middle  Niger, 
and  has  hitherto  exercised  some  authority  over  the 
district  of  Gurma  and  that  of  Nup6. 

Adamawttf  OGGU-pjing  both  banks  of  the  Upper  Benu6, 
and  stretching  away  to  the  south,  is  also  nominally 
dependent  on  Sokoto.  Some  of  its  minor  states  are  in 
Fulah  hands  and  some  are  still  Negro.  The  centre  of 
trade  is  Yola,  on  the  Benu6.  Slaves  and  ivory  have 
long  been  exported,  the  ivory  being  collected  by  the 
Hausas  and  sold  by  them. 

Lake  Chad  States. — 5orw^  is  inhabited  principally 
by  a  Negro  people,  unattractive  physically  and  men- 
tally, called  the  Kanuri.  It  has  been  a  kingdom  ever 
since  Islam  was  introduced  a  thousand  years  ago,  and 
the  Fulahs  have  not  obtained  the  upper  hand  here. 
The  capital,  Kuka,  is  a  walled  town  of  60,000  in- 
habitants, and  is  the  terminus  to  the  Bilma  route  across 
the  Sahara.  It  is  also  the  objective  of  the  French 
trans- Saharan  railway.  The  kingdom  has  lately 
declined,  though  its  Sultan  used  to  keep  an  army  of 
30,000  men  !     The  soil  is  fertile  and  produces  abundant 


NEGRO- LAND  :     THE  GREAT   SUDAN  57 

crops ;  its  breed  of  horses  is  also  famous.  Slaves, 
ivory,  and  ostrich  feathers  have  been  its  principal 
exports,  while  European  goods,  cotton,  sugar,  &c.. 
have  been  introduced  by  way  of  the  desert.  If  a  state 
like  this  were  won  for  Christ,  what  history  might  not 
lie  before  it ! 

Bagirmi  lies  to  the  south-east  of  Lake  Chad,  and 
has  now  fallen  largely  under  the  influence  of  Wadai. 
The  population  is  pure  Negro  to  the  south,  though 
much  mixed  to  the  north.  The  dominant  race  is 
said  to  have  come  from  Sennaar,  on  the  Nile,  three 
hundred  years  ago,  and  founded  the  present  capital 
of  Masenya. 

Wadai,  lying  to  the  east  of  Lake  Chad,  is  the  only 
Sudan  state  not  yet  included  in  any  European  sphere. 
During  the  reign  of  Sheikh  Ali,  the  father  of  the  present 
king,  it  much  increased  in  importance,  and  after  con- 
quering Bagirmi  in  1871,  wrested  Kanem  (a  pastoral 
district  to  the  north-east  of  Lake  Chad)  from  Bornu. 
The  Mabas,  a  Negro  race,  are  the  rulers  in  Wadai,  and 
professors  of  Islam ;  many  Fulahs  and  Arabs  have 
also  come  into  the  country,  and  introduced  their  dress 
and  customs.  The  capital  is  Abeshr,  and  there  are  in 
"Wadai  about  2,500,000  people  of  an  uncultured  and 
exclusive  type.  A  trade  in  ivory  and  ostrich  feathers, 
similar  to  that  in  Bornu,  is  carried  on  across  the  desert, 
but  the  soil  of  the  country  is  a  poor  one  and  only  fit  for 
cattle-rearing. 

European  Colonies. 

1.  British  Possessions  occupy  six  separate 
parts  of  the  west  coast.  We  take  these  in  order  from 
west  to  east. 

The  Gambia,  after  being  variously  connected  with 
other  colonies,  was  made  a  separate  Crown  Colony  in 
1888.  Its  trade  is,  however,  unimportant,  and  mostly 
in  the  hands  of  the  French.  Their  territory  now  com- 
pletely surrounds  the  colony,  which  is  limited  to  the 
banks  of  the  river   below  the  rapid.      Ground  nuts, 


58  AFRICA    WAITING 


exported  to  Marseilles,  form  the  only  important  pro- 
duct. Bathurst,  founded  in  1816,  has  a  population  of 
about  6000. 

Sierra  Leone,  which  has  already  been  mentioned, 
with  its  capital  of  Freetown,  became  a  Crown  Colony 
in  1807.  Like  the  Gambia,  it  is  now  shut  in 
towards  the  interior  by  the  French  possessions.  ■  Its 
boundaries  on  the  north  -.nd  south  are  close  to  the 
Scarcies  and  the  Manna  rivers,  and  the  area  of  the 
Protectorate  is  three-quarters  the  size  of  Ireland.  The 
Sierra  Leone  peninsula,  on  which  Freetown  stands, 
is  formed  by  a  range  of  volcanic  mountains.  It 
shelters  the  mouth  of  the  Sierra  Leone  river,  and 
thus  forms  the  best  harbour  on  the  coast,  and  is 
exceedingly  useful  as  being  the  half-way  point  between 
England  and  the  Cape. 

A  trade  route  of  importance  leads  by  way  of  Falaba 
to  Sulimania,  Tj  town  very  close  to  the  sources  of  the 
Niger.  Steps  have  also  been  taken  to  improve  the 
communications  by  means  of  a  railway,  and  the  trade 
and  revenue  are  already  increasing.  The  chief  exports 
include  palm-oil  and  kernels,  kola  nuts,  india-rubber, 
and  gum  copal,  while  cotton  goods  are  imported  :rom  the 
British  Isles.  Sherbro  Island  deserves  notice  as  being 
an  important  centre  to  which  several  lagoons  converge. 
This  place  and  Sierra  Leone  are,  however,  notoriously 
unhealthy,  like  the  West  Coast  generally. 

The  Oold  Coast  extends  along  a  seaboard  of  350 
miles,  and,  including  the  Ashanti  country  behind,  is 
considerably  larger  than  Scotland.  Its  principal  towns 
are  Cape  Coast  Castle  and  Accra.  There  is  not  one 
good  harbour  on  the  coast,  and  the  only  good  road 
into  the  interior  is  that  starting  from  Cape  Coast  in 
the  direction  of  Kumasi,  the  capital  of  Ashanti.  The 
abundance  of  gold-dust  in  the  district  has  given  the 
coast  its  name,  and  an  increasing  amount  is  exported, 
though  palm-oil  and  rubber  exports  take  the  first  place. 
The  country  is  also  unusually  rich  in  timber,  but  its 
many  rivers  are  of  very  little  use  for  transport.  As 
regards  climate,  the  eastern  districts,  and  especially 


negro-land:    the  great  SUDAh^  50 

the  open  country  behind  Accra,  are  the  least  unhealthy. 
There  are  about  1,500,000  people  in  the  colony  and 
protectorate,  the  tribes  of  the  Fanti  confederation  in- 
habiting the  coast  line  and  the  Ashantis  the  interior. 
The  former  have  gained  a  name  for  their  cowardice, 
and  the  latter  for  debased  superstitions  and  human 
sacrifices. 

Lagos  owes  its  existence  to  the  slave  trade,  and 
continued  to  be  a  slave-market  until  1851.  Ten  years 
later  it  was  ceded  to  Great  Britain  by  its  native  king. 
It  is  uniquely  situated  on  an  island,  which  commands 
all  the  chief  inlets  to  the  Yoruba  country  for  a  dis- 
tance of  nearly  100  miles  each  way,  land-locked  lagoons 
stretching  from  the  Denham  waters  of  Dahomey  on 
the  west  to  the  Benin  river  on  the  east.  Actual 
British  territory  only  extends  thirty  miles  inland,  but 
by  treaties  with  the  Yorubans  the  whole  of  their  country- 
is  virtually  under  British  protection.  The  Yorubans 
have  gathered  themselves  into  several  large  cities,  such 
as  Abeokuta,  Ibadan,  and  Oyo,  each  containing  over 
50,000  souls,  and  walled  as  a  protection  from  slave- 
raiders.  Their  trade  also  deals  chiefly  in  palm-oil  and 
palm -kernels. 

The  Niger  Coast  Protectorate,  long  known  as  the  "  Oil 
Eivers,"  is  the  name  for  that  part  of  the  coast  which 
lies  between  Benin  river  and  the  Cameroons.  It  also 
includes  most  of  the  Niger  Delta,  and  its  teeming 
populations.  Brass,  Bonny,  Opobo,  and  Old  Calabar 
are  the  chief  trading  centres,  but  their  populations  have 
been  largely  demorahzed  by  the  gin  traffic.  The 
mouths  of  the  Niger  by  which  steamers  usually  ascend 
the  river  are  the  Forcados  and  the  Nun. 

The  Niger  Company  territories  include  all  those 
lands  on  the  lower  river  not  included  in  the  protectorate. 
Their  northern  boundary  still  requires  precise  defini- 
tion, but  treaties  have  been  made  with  the  rulers  of 
Sokoto,  Gando,  Borgu,  and  Yola,  securing  the  influence 
of  the  Company  over  an  area  of  about  500,000  square 
miles.  The  difference  between  the  work  of  the  Niger 
Company  and  that  of  other  colonies  is  the  difference 


6o  AFRICA    WAITING 


between  opening  up  a  great  river  and  a  seaboard. 
The  Niger  river  is  the  natural  outlet  for  the  populous 
states  of  the  Central  Sudan,  and  thus  a  great  future 
lies  before  them. 

2.  French  Possessions. — By  securing  the  greater 
part  of  the  interior  of  the  Western  Sudan,  France 
has  united  almost  all  her  possessions.  Towards 
the  north  this  vast  sphere  is  continuous  with  the 
French  sphere  of  influence  in  the  Sahara,  and  is 
thus  connected  through  it  with  Algeria.  It  has  four 
parts. 

Senegal,  the  oldest  French  possession  in  West 
Africa,  embraces  all,  the  region  between  the  Lower 
Senegal  and  the  Casamanza  to  the  south,  except  the 
strip  of  British  Gambia  in  the  middle.  St.  Louis  was 
founded  in  the  seventeenth  century;  but  it  is  only 
within  the  last  twenty  years  that  any  great  advance 
has  been  made.  Since  then  the  Mohammedan  chiefs, 
Ahmadu  and  Samory,  have  been  overcome ;  and 
finally,  in  1894,  Timbuctu  itself  was  occupied.  St. 
Louis,  however,  from  its  position  can  never  be  an 
important  port,  and  the  products  of  the  country  are 
not  even  as  large  as  those  of  Lagos  alone. 

French  Sudan  includes  the  whole  region  of  the 
Upper  Senegal,  Gambia,  and  Niger  rivers.  The 
administrative  centre  is  Kayes,  on  the  Senegal,  from 
which  a  railway  has  been  projected  and  begun  towards 
Bamako  on  the  Niger;  Sego,  Jenne,  and  Timbuctu 
have  also  all  been  famous  in  their  day.  In  the  south- 
west the  highlands  of  Futa  Jallon,  in  Samory's  former 
kingdom,  are  now  in  the  hands  of  the  French.  So  far 
mihtary  rule  has  been  estabhshed,  but  httle  trade  has 
been  developed.  A  telegraph  line  has,  however,  already 
reached  the  Niger. 

Fr&nch  Guinea  includes  the  coast  between  Portuguese 
Guinea  and  Sierra  Leone,  and  borders  on  Futa  JaUon 
inland. 

The  Ivory  Coast  hes  between  Liberia  and  the  British 
Gold  Coast.  Grand  Bassam,  the  capital,  is  situated 
like  Lagos,  on  a  narrow  belt  of  sand'which  separates  the 


NEGRO-LAND:     THE   GREAT  SUDAN  6l 

lagoons  from  the  sea.  It  has  come  into  importance 
since  1892,  when  Captain  Binger  returned  to  France 
to  show  that  its  rivers  supply  routes  far  into  the 
interior,  especially  to  the  important  town  of  Kong. 

Dahomey  has  recently  been  conquered  by  the  French, 
though  the  English  and  Dutch  had  also  had  forts  at 
Whydah  in  the  eighteenth  century.  The  gross  human 
sacrifices,  which  in  former  times  were  constantly 
offered,  are  now  forbidden. 

3.  Other  European  Possessions. — The  only  part, 
of  former  Portuguese  possessions  in  Guinea,  which  is 
retained  to-day,  is  a  small  section  of  country  sur- 
rounded by  French  Senegal  and  Guinea.  Bissao  is 
the  principal  station,  but  the  trade  is  insignificant. 

German  Togoland  occupies  a  small  part  of  the 
slave  coast,  and  widens  inland  with  the  bend  of  the 
river  Volta,  which  forms  its  western  boundary  on  the 
Gold  Coast  side.  The  country  was  annexed  in  1884, 
and  much  is  being  done  to  extend  German  influence 
into  the  interior. 

The  Cameroons.  The  name  Cameroons — also  ap- 
plied to  the  lofty  peak  just  north  of  the  estuary — has 
been  extended  to  stand  for  the  whole  country  under 
German  rule  in  those  parts.  It  extends  inland  north- 
eastward to  Lake  Chad  and  the  river  Shari,  eastward 
to  15°  E.,  and  south  to  the  French  Congo.  Its  chief 
centres  on  the  coast  are  Victoria,  Cameroon  Town,  and 
Batanga,  while  inland  Yaunde  is  the  most  important. 
Explorers  tell  us  that,  after  the  dense  forest  belt  has 
been  crossed,  an  open  and  fertile  country  lies  behind. 
Were  not  the  climate  so  unhealthy,  even  the  Came- 
roons peak  not  being  free  from  malaria,  the  colony 
would  become  very  prosperous  ;  for  successful  planta- 
tions have  been  started,  and  large  amounts  of  palm- 
oil,  palm-kernels,  rubber,  and  ivory  are  exported. 

A  Christian  State. 

Liberia  is  the  only  Christian  Negro  state  in  Africa. 
It  is  situated  on  the  Grain  and  Ivory  Coasts  of  Upper 
Guinea,  and  has  a  remarkably  fine  coast  line  of  about 


62  AFRICA    WAITING 


500  miles  on  the  Atlantic  Ocean.  It  also  extends 
for  about  300  miles  towards  the  high  interior  plateau 
on  the  north-east.  The  same  causes  which  led  to  the 
founding  of  Sierra  Leone  led  to  establishing  the  re- 
pubUc  of  Liberia.  In  this  connexion  Thomas  Jefferson's 
"Notes  on  Virginia"  should  always  be  remembered. 
This  book  created  a  great  stir  a  hundred  years  ago, 
and  led  to  some  interesting  correspondence  between 
him  and  President  Monroe  upon  the  condition  of  the 
Negro  in  American  colonies.  But  Samuel  Mills  of 
Williams  College,  one  of  ohe  first  American  Student 
Volunteers,  was  the  means  of  bringing  American 
Christians  to  take  decided  action.  The  result  was 
the  foundation  of  the  American  Bible  Society  and 
Board  of  Foreign  Missions.  At  length,  in  1817,  Mills 
himself  set  out  for  Africa,  with  Ebenezer  Burgess,  to 
explore  the  western  coast  and  choose  a  suitable  spot 
for  colonization. 

The  present  territory  was  acquired  by  treaties  and 
purchase,  and  settled  between  the  years  1822-74  by 
the  American  Colonization  Society.  In  1847  Liberia 
acquired  her  independence  as  a  sovereign  Negro  state 
of  Africa,  and  has  been  recognized  as  such  by  leading 
nations.  The  Government  of  the  country  is  similar  to 
that  of  the  United  States  of  America. 

Liberia  is  essentially  an  Africo-American  experiment 
in  colonization.  It  is  answering  the  question : — "  Is 
the  negro  capable  of  receiving  and  maintaining  a  super- 
imposed civilization?"  Certainly  it  has  had  some 
Christian  Negroes  with  the  capacity  for  self-govern- 
ment, and  further,  it  is  not  only  a  colony  but  a  step 
towards  repatriation,  and  the  solution  of  *'  the  Negro 
Problem  "  in  America. 

The  republic  now  contains  somewhat  over 
1,000,000  people,  of  whom  about  40,000  are  civilized 
and  under  Christian  influence,  while  the  rest  are  either 
Mohammedans  or  Pagans.  Both  the  Veys  and  Greboes 
can  read  and  write  to  a  limited  extent,  while  the 
Mohammedan  Mandingos  of  the  interior  use  the  Arabic 
language. 


NEGRO-LAND:     THE   GREAT  SUDAN  63 

The  soil  of  Liberia  is  capable  of  producing,  not  only 
everything  grown  in  the  tropics,  but  several  fruits, 
vegetables,  and  cereals  of  temperate  zones.  A  special 
mention  must  be  made  of  "Liberia  coffee,"  which  is 
really  excellent.  In  1893  this  product  alone  brought 
in  £1,000,000.  To  be  a  coffee  farmer  is  the  way  to 
become  wealthy.  The  palm-kernel  trade,  which  has 
now  developed  all  along  the  west  coast,  was  first 
started  in  Liberia ;  while  rubber  abounds  in  the  forests. 

West  African  Missions. 

Having  now  been  introduced  to  the  countries  and 
the  peoples  of  the  great  Sudan,  an  attempt  is  made 
to  give  in  outline  a  summary  of  the  work  of  the  leading 
missionary  agencies  there.  Chronological  order  is 
adhered  to  throughout. 

First  Efforts. — As  elsewhere,  so  in  Africa,  the 
Moravians  were  the  first  Protestant  missionaries.  As 
early  as  1736  we  find  Protten  trying  to  found  a  school 
among  the  slaves  of  the  Gold  Coast.  But,  during  the 
first  thirty-five  years  of  their  mission,  eleven  mission- 
aries died  and  the  work  had  to  be  abandoned. 

Next  in  order  came  the  Society  for  the  Propagation 
of  the  Gospel  in  1752,  sending  Thompson,  a  fellow  of 
Christ's  College,  Cambridge,  to  the  Gold  Coast.  As 
the  fruit  of  his  work  Philip  Quaque,  a  Negro,  was 
ordained,  and  laboured  as  his  successor  for  "  upwards 
of  fifty  years  "  as  a  missionary  and  a  chaplain.  No 
permanent  work,  however,  was  established  there. 

In  1795  the  English  Baptists  entered  Sierra  Leone, 
and  the  year  after,  the  London,  Glasgow,  and  Edinburgh 
societies  united  to  open  up  work  amongst  the  Fulahs. 
But  dissension  and  disease  brought  about  sad  failure. 

Coast  Settlements  (1800-20) — There  were  no 
missionaries  left  when  the  Church  Missionary  Society 
began  its  now  world-wide  missions,  by  sending  two 
men  to  the  Susu  country,  near  Sierra  Leone  (1804). 
The  Wesleyan  Methodists  soon  followed  them  in  1811, 
and  have  extended  their  work  from  the  Gambia  to  the 
Niger  almost  {pari  passu  with  the  C.M.S.     In  1816  the 


64  APR  ICA     IF  A ITING 


C.M.S.  established  work  in  Sierra  Leone  itself,  and 
concentrated  missionary  force  upon  it.  In  those  early 
days  it  pleased  God  to  pour  out  His  blessing,  and 
thousands  of  liberated  slaves  were  brought  under 
Christian  instruction.  Johnson's  work  at  Eegent  was 
especially  blessed,  for  within  three  years  of  his  arrival 
he  had'  1200  worshippers  every  Sunday,  and  500  at 
daily  prayers,  260  communicants,  and  500  scholars 
of  all  ages  at  school.  Independent  testimonies  also 
came  from  the  Chief  Justice  and  Naval  Officers  as  to 
the  permanent  transformation  that  had  taken  place. 

1821-42. — The  year  1821  saw  the  American  Baptists 
enter  the  new  founded  colony  of  Liberia.  Within  fifteen 
years  five  churches  had  been  set  up  with  250  members, 
drawn  from  coloured  immigrants  from  America. 

A  terrible  season  of  trial  met  the  C.M.S.  at  Sierra 
Leone  (1823-5),  for  out  of  eleven  missionaries  and  their 
wives  who  landed  in  1823,  six  died  in  that  year,  and 
three  more  within  eighteen  months  afterwards.  By 
the  beginning  of  1826,  twenty-two  years  after  the  first 
party  sailed  for  West  Africa,  only  fourteen  (mission- 
aries, schoolmasters,  and  wives)  remained  out  of 
seventy-nine  who  had  been  sent  out.  It  was,  there- 
fore, at  once  a  courageous  and  a  wise  step  to  found 
the  Fourah  Bay  College  at  Sierra  Leone  during  the 
very  next  year  (1827).  This  College  has  now  had  the 
honour  of  being  affiliated  to  Durham  University  for 
twenty  years. 

The  same  year  the  noble  Basle  Mission  entered 
Liberia,  and  later  on  the  Gold  Coast,  only  to  suffer  as 
terrible  mortality  among  its  workers  ao  overy  other 
mission.  During  the  first  fifty  years  of  their  work,  out 
of  127  missionaries,  thirty-nine  died  after  an  average  of 
two  years'  service,  and  fifty  returned  home  invahded ! 

In  1832  both  the  American  Presbyterians  and  the 
American  Methodists  arrived  in  Liberia.  The  Presby- 
terians soon  decided  to  substitute  coloured  ministers 
for  white.  The  Methodists  sent  Melville  Cox  as  their 
pioneer,  who  became  the  author  of  his  own  epitaph. 
**  Write,"  said  he,  '*  let  a  thousand  fall  before  Africa  be 


NEGRO-LAND  :    THE  GREAT  SUDAN  ^5 

given  up."  He  soon  died,  but  others  entered  into  his 
labours,  and  the  missionaries  are  now  under  the  super- 
vision of  Bishop  Taylor,  assisted  by  fifty  native  local 
preachers.  The  churches  have  upwards  of  3400  com- 
municants, and  there  are  at  least  3000  pupils  in  schools. 
In  1834  the  American  Episcopalia7is  followed,  and 
Bishop  Payne  laboured  there  for  thirty- four  years  with 
manifest  blessing.  The  present  Bishop,  Ferguson, 
of  African  descent,  was  the  third  coloured  clergy- 
man to  be  consecrated  to  the  Episcopate  (1884). 
The  sixth  American  mission  was  started  in  1842.  It 
was  first  called  the  Mendi  Mission,  and  settled  down 
in  the  Sherbro  country.  Whites  had  again  to  be 
changed  for  coloured  missionaries  from  the  United 
States.  In  1883  this  work  was  handed  over  to  the 
United  Brethren,  who  had  long  been  labouring  close 
by.  The  Christians  there  outnumber  those  of  every 
other  American  Mission  in  Africa. 

Extension  (1841-60). — The  first  advance  into  the 
interior  was  that  of  the  First  Niger  Expedition,  fitted 
up  by  the  British  Government  (1841)  to  aim  a  fresh 
and  effectual  blow  at  the  slave  trade,  and  to  promote 
legitimate  commerce.  J.  F.  Schon,  the  experienced 
linguist,  and  Samuel  Crowther,  the  African,  were 
allowed  to  ajccompany  the  expedition.  It  closed  with 
many  disasters,  and  for  some  years  was  a  byword  as 
a  hopeless  failure.  The  second  step  in  this  direction 
was  taken  by  Henry  Townsend  (of  Sierra  Leone),  who 
paid  a  visit  to  Aheohuta,  the  largest  town  in  Yoruba, 
and  the  refuge  city  of  the  Egbas,  100,000  strong.  He 
arrived  in  January,  1843,  and  was  warmly  received. 
His  visit  resulted  in  his  going  there  to  start  a  mission 
with  Samuel  Crowther.  After  many  delays  they 
entered  Abeokuta  in  August,  1846,  and  within  three 
years'  time  a  remarkable  awakening  took  place. 

About  the  same  time  the  Cameroons  Mission  was 
begun  by  Enghsh  and  West  Indian  Baptists  (1844). 
Alfred  Saker,  the  great  industrial  missionary,  proved 
also  to  be  a  good  linguist,  and  translated  the  New 
Testament  into  the  Dualla  language,  and  the  mission 


66  AFRICA    WAITING 


grew,  until  asked  to  withdraw  when  the  Germans 
annexed  that  territory.  Two  years  after  this  (1846) 
the  United  Presbyterians  of  Scotland  started  work 
in  Old  Calabar,  just  to  the  west  of  the  Cameroons 
Mission.  Their  design  from  the  first  has  been  to  man 
it  with  Africans.  They  have  so  far  succeeded  in 
gaining  two  native  ministers  and  twenty-three  native 
agents.  Yet  again,  the  (North  German)  Bremen  Mis- 
sion occupied  Evheland  (now  part  of  Togoland)  in  1847. 
But  out  of  160  labourers,  sixty-seven  died  at  their 
work  or  immediately  after  their  return  home.  The 
special  feature  of  its  work  is  the  system  of  training 
young  natives  (Evheer)  in  a  small  village  in  Wur- 
temberg. 

Rapidly  passing  on,  we  find  Lagos  occupied  by 
the  veteran  Gollmer,  immediately  after  a  British 
Protectorate  had  been  established  over  it  by  Lord 
Palmerston  (1851).  Here  we  see  the  greatest  slave- 
market  on  the  coast  converted  into  a  native  settlement 
and  put  under  Christian  influences.  Meanwhile  the 
older  settlement  at  Sierra  Leone  had  become  ready  for 
the  appointment  of  its  first  Bishop  (1852).  The  Rev. 
O.  E.  Vidal,  "  a  Sussex  clergyman  who  had  been  led 
to  devote  rare  linguistic  talent  to  the  study  of  the 
Yoruba  and  other  African  languages,"  was  appointed, 
only,  however,  to  labour  for  two  years.  He  was  soon 
to  be  succeeded  by  Bishops  Weeks  and  Bowen,  but  all 
three  men  of  God  lay  buried  in  Kissey  churchyard  in 
less  than  seven  years. 

Twelve  years  passed  away,  and  a  Second  Niger 
Expedition,  of  one  steamer,  the  Pleiad,  under  Dr. 
Baikie,  was  sent  out  in  1854,  and  proved  a  signal 
success.  The  river  Benu6  was  ascended  for  350  miles 
above  the  confluence  and  not  one  death  was  re- 
corded. This  expedition  was  again  accompanied  by 
Samuel  Crowther,  then  a  clergyman  of  eleven  years' 
standing;  and  Baikie  afterwards  wrote  personally  to 
him  and  thanked  him  for  his  great  assistance.  He 
found  the  kings  and  chiefs  everywhere  ready  to  receive 
Christian  teachers,  SO  two  further  attempts  were  made 


NEGRO-LAND :     THE  GREAT  SUDAN  67 

by  steamer  in  1857  and  1859  to  start  a  Niger  Mission. 
But  the  difficulties  of  communication  were  too  great 
to  allow  of  a  permanent  occupation.  In  the  former, 
the  steamer  was  wrecked  at  a  point  more  than  400 
miles  from  the  sea,  and  Crowther,  only  after  long 
delay,  reached  Lagos  overland  through  the  Yoruba 
country.  During  the  year  (1859)  the  United  Metho- 
dists entered  Sierra  Leone,  and  their  Mission-work 
dates  from  this  period.  Once  more  the  American 
Lutherans  founded  another  small  settlement  in  Liberia 
(1860)  for  the  families  of  some  recaptured  slaves. 
Among  other  small  societies  must  not  be  forgotten  the 
American  Baptist  Convention  (S.)  which  has  its  chief 
stations  at  Lagos  and  Abeokuta. 

Native  Churches  (1861-90).  —  The  next  thirty 
years  saw  a  great  development  among  the  native 
churches.  The  Sierra  Leone  Native  Church  was 
organized  in  1862  to  be  "  self-governing,  self-sup- 
porting, and  self -extending."  Other  chmxhes  soon 
followed,  so  that  the  year  1864  marks  the  consecra- 
tion of  the  first  Negro  to  be  a  Bishop.  Samuel 
Crowther,  the  first  Bishop  of  the  Niger,  was  **  A 
Yoruban  by  birth,  had  been  shipped  at  Lagos  as  a 
slave  boy  in  1822,  rescued  by  H.M.S.  Myrmidon, 
taken  to  Sierra  Leone,  educated  by  the  C.M.S.  mis- 
sionaries, baptized  in  1825,  employed  as  a  school 
teacher,  ordained  in  1843,  sent  to  Abeokuta  in  1844, 
and,  having  been  a  member  of  both  the  earlier  Niger 
Expeditions,  was  appointed  leader  of  the  new  Niger 
Mission  in  1857.  After  thirty-four  years  of  labour  on 
the  Niger,  aod  twenty-seven  as  a  Bishop,  he  died 
December  31st,  1891,  at  Lagos  where  his  remains 
were  interred  with  every  mark,  of  reverence  and 
afi'ection  from  Europeans  and  Natives  alike." 

Crowther  returned  to  the  Niger  as  Bishop,  to 
begin  missions  in  the  Delta.  The  occupation  of 
Bonny  (1866)  and  Brass  (1868)  meant  work  begun 
amongst  the  most  degraded  of  Pagans.  Cannibahsm 
was  not  then  extinct,  human  sacrifices  were  still 
offered    at   the  burial   of   chiefs,   and  ju-ju   (or   gin- 

p  2

bottle)  feasts  were  only  too  common.  Slowly  the 
Gospel  took  effect,  till  twenty  years  later  we  find 
Christians  from  both  places  carrying  the  Gospel  to 
others  a  hundred  miles  away.  Several  other  stations 
have  since  been  occupied,  but  of  late  years  the  zeal 
and  purity  of  the  congregations  has  suffered  a  decline, 
from  contact  with  Europeans  and  the  appalling 
importations  of  gin,  which  has  actually  become  the 
currency  of  the  country. 

The  history  of  the  Yoruba  and  Abeokuta  Mission  has 
also  been  a  chequered  one.  Between  1851  and  1876 
seven  invasions  were  made  by  Dahomians  into  the 
Yoruba  country,  attended  by  shocking  cruelties  and 
tortures.  Not  less  disastrous  have  been  the  inter- 
tribal wars  between  different  sections  of  the  Yoruba 
people,  principally  caused  by  jealousies  and  disputes 
regarding  trade-routes  to  the  coast.  In  1862  several 
missionaries  barely  escaped  with  their  lives,  and  Mr. 
and  Mrs.  Hinderer  were  shut  up  in  Ibadan  for"  four 
years,  suffering  great  privations.  After  this,  all  mis- 
sionaries and  white  men  were  expelled  from  Abeokuta 
for  twelve  years  (1867-79),  only  Mr.  Townsend  being 
allowed  to  pay  two  short  visits  during  that  time.  The 
Christian  congregations,  however,  went  on  increasing 
under  native  pastors,  and  now  they  have  2  assistant 
native  Bishops,  4  native  clergy  and  24  native  teachers. 

The  same  story  has  to  be  told  about  the  Basle 
Mission  to  the  Gold  Coast.  The  great  Ashanti  wa 
(1869)  broke  up  their  mission,  and  Messrs.  Eamseyer 
and  Kiihne  were  kept  in  Kumasi  as  prisoners  for  four 
years.  However,  the  British  campaign  in  Ashanti 
(1874)  resulted  in  their  release,  and  now  there  are 
mission  stations  and  out-stations  all  the  way  from  the 
coast  to  Kumasi,  and  across  the  Volta  into  Togoland ; 
and  besides  this,  there  are  16  native  pastors  and  112 
native  helpers  and  teachers.  Not  only  here,  but  also 
in  Togoland,  the  Germans  are  most  successful  in 
raising  up  a  native  ministry. 

Lastly,  in  the  Cameroons,  we  find  the  Basle  Mission 
taking  over  the  premises  and  congregations  of  the 
Baptist  Mission  (1886)  and  introducing  a  strong  church 


NEGRO-LAND  :     THE   GREAT   SUDAN  69 

discipline.  This  unfortunately  led  to  the  separation 
of  some  of  the  former  adherents.  In  spite  of  this, 
however,  the  work  has  spread  far  into  the  interior, 
especially  on  the  Upper  Wuri  and  Abo,  where  a  native 
prince,  Koto,  opened  the  way  by  preaching  the  Gospel. 
Leagues  have  been  formed  there  by  "  the  men  of 
God  "  against  Heathenism  and  uncleanness. 

Education. — The  leading  Protestant  educational 
institutions  in  West  Africa  are — the  C.M.S.  Fourah 
Bay  College,  Grammar  School,  and  Female  Institution 
at  Sierra  Leone  ;  the  Wesleyan  schools  in  Gambia, 
Sierra  Leone,  and  the  Gold  Coast ;  the  German 
teachers'  seminaries  in  Togoland  and  the  Cameroons ; 
and  the  C.M.S.  Training  Institution  at  Lagos. 

Translational  work  is  still  in  its  infancy.  The  mul- 
titude of  Negro  tongues  have  so  far  defied  any  attempts 
to  obtain  a  few  widely-spoken  languages.  Dr.  Koelle 
and  J.  F.  Schon  have  been  by  far  the  ablest  linguists 
in  the  past,  and  were  duly  recognized  as  such  respec- 
tively at  the  French  Institute  and  at  Oxford. 

The  S^cdan  Problem. 

Till  1890  we  see  that  little  had  been  done  to  preach 
the  Gospel  in  the  interior.  The  travels  of  Europeans, 
especially  those  of  Barth,  had  revealed  to  us  a 
perfectly  new  world,  with  large  towns  and  populations, 
and  a  thriving  trade  ;  above  all,  with  three  dominant 
languages — Arabic,  the  sacred  language  of  religion  ; 
Hausa,  the  medium  of  commerce ;  and  Fula,  the 
emblem  of  conquest. 

The  three  Niger  expeditions,  organized  by  the  British 
Government  in  1841,  1854,  1857,  had  secured,  till  the 
fall  of  Khartum,  British  influence  over  Upper  Niger 
territories.  Moreover,  in  1879,  the  first  Henry  Venn 
steamer  successfully  ascended  the  Benu6  for  more  than 
500  miles,  showing  it  to  be  a  wonderful  highway  into 
the  far  interior.     Still  little  further  was  done. 

In  the  years  1890  and  1893  respectively,  however, 
two  parties  of  missionaries  went  forth  to  the  Sudan. 
Of  these  noble  men  only  two  now  survive,  but  the 
graves  of  G.  Wilmot  Brooke,    J.  A.  Bobinson,   and 


70  AFRICA    WAITING 


C.  E.  Watney  at  Lokoja,  of  Bishop  Hill  at  Lagos, 
and  of  E.  W.  Mathias  at  Forcados  and  Dobinson  on 
the  Niger,  point  to  the  fields  of  the  great  Sudan. 
Further  particulars  of  their  work  is  found  in  the 
volumes  of  the  CM.  Intelligencer  and  Gleaner  for 
1890,  '91,  '92.  In  memory  of  J.  A.  Eobinson,  a 
Hausa  association  has  been  founded,  which  undertakes 
to  further  the  study  of  the  Hausa  language  in  Britain, 
and  to  promote  the  commercial  and  spiritual  interests 
of  the  country. 

Now  Hausa  is  to  Northern  Africa  to-day  what  Greek 
was  to  the  Eoman  world.  It  is  the  medium  of  com- 
munication between  the  states  of  the  Sudan.  It  has  a 
literature  of  its  own,  and  though  its  origin  is  not  yet 
defined,  it  is  at  any  rate  a  combination  of  three  groups 
of  languages.  Surely  it  wiU  be  a  privilege  to  give  the 
Bible  to  the  whole  Sudan.  This  God-sent  means  of 
reaching  all  the  neediest  parts  of  Africa  must  be  used 
at  once. 

Recent  political  events  have  still  further  turned 
attention  to  these  important  fields.  In  the  east  the 
steady  downfall  of  the  Mahdi's  power  has  revived 
public  interest,  while  the  recent  British  victories  in  the 
west  have  established  British  prestige  over  an  area  one- 
half  the  size  of  India.  "  By  the  vigorous  action  of  the 
Boyal  Niger  Company,"  Bishop  Tugwell  states  that 
"  an  oppressed  people  (theBunus)  have  been  delivered, 
a  devastated  country  will  be  repopulated,  a  slave-raiding 
kingdom  has  been  brought  into  subjection.''  And  Mr. 
Eobinson  adds  : — ''  Few  people  at  home  can  realize  the 
enormous  population  existing  in  Hausa-land.  It  is  esti- 
mated to  be  at  least  1  %  of  the  world's  population." 

There  is,  therefore,  an  open  door  to-day  into  the 
Central  Sudan,  and  a  challenge  has  been  sent  by  Bishop 
Tugwell  to  the  Christian  world  to  send  forth  labourers. 
In  response  to  his  appeal  some  thousands  of  pounds 
have  been  subscribed  to  start  the  work.  He  now  asks 
for  20  to  30  men  to  step  in  at  once,  and  has  decided 
to  visit  Yakoba,  a  place  which  is  reputed  to  be 
healthy,  and  to  stand  upon  a  plateau  of  some  2500  feet 
above  the  sea.

BANTU-LAND  :     CENTBAL   AFEICA. 

Portuguese    "West    and    East    Africa. — The 

history  of  the  Portuguese,  and  Eomish,  Missions  in 
Central  Africa  form  a  natural  beginning  to  this  chapter. 
No  sooner  had  Diego  Cam  discovered  the  Congo  (1485), 
than  the  native  chief  of  the  country  south  of  the  Congo 
became  a  nominal  convert  to  Christianity,  and  the  head- 
quarters of  his  dominion,  under  the  name  of  San  Sal- 
vador, rose  to  be  a  flourishing  town  with  churches  and 
other  buildings.  Soon,  however,  St.  Paul  de  Loanda 
took  its  place  as  the  centre  of  Portuguese  influence. 
Other  settlements,  such  as  Benguela,  were  also 
formed,  the  farthest  being  the  village  of  Kasange, 
about  300  miles  inland.  The  name  Angola  is  now 
given  to  the  whole  region  of  Portuguese  influence, 
which  includes  five  provinces. 

In  East  Africa,  as  early  as  1505,  Sofala  was  taken 
from  the  Arabs  ;  while  the  ports  of  Mozambique  and 
Kilimani  soon  followed.  Sena,  Tete,  and  Zumbo 
still  mark  their  route  into  the  interior  along  the  lower 
course  of  the  Zambesi,  but  no  footing  was  obtained  in 
the  highland  plateaux. 

Romish  Missions  in  Central  Africa. — No 
missionaries  were  ever  more  zealous  than  the  Jesuit 
and  other  priests  who  poured  into  Central  Africa  in 
the  16th  century ;  and  no  outward  and  temporary 
success  was  ever  more  remarkable.  But  hardly  any 
parts  of  Africa  are  so  degraded  to-day.  Not  even 
nominal  Christianity  remains  among  the  natives  of 
the  Congo,   or  of  Loango,   while  the  Christians  in 


BANTU-LAND  :    CENTRAL    AFRICA  73 

Loanda  are  as  heathenish  as  the  Heathen.  Mr.  H. 
Eowley,  late  of  the  Universities'  Mission,  gives  a 
sad  picture,  as  an  eye-witness,  of  the  Mozambique  and 
Zambesi  districts,  and  says  : — "  I  fear  they  are  a  shame 
to  humanity — to  say  nothing  of  Christianity." 

He  attributes  the  "  utter  relapse  of  the  Christians 
into  heathenism  "  and  the  "  melancholy  deterioration 
of  the  Europeans,"  to  the  wholesale  administration  of 
baptism,  the  unholy  accommodation  of  Christian  truth 
and  observances  to  heathenish  superstitions  and 
customs,  the  neglect  of  education  for  the  young,  the 
attempts  to  prop,  up  waning  influence  by  a  pretended 
exercise  of  miracles,  the  cruel  punishment  inflicted 
for  the  slightest  deviation  from  the  prescribed  rules  of 
the  Church,  and  lastly,  the  close  connexion  that 
Eomanism  in  Central  Africa  has  had  with  the  slave- 
trade,  as  illustrated  by  the  marble  chair  to  be  seen 
until  lately  on  the  pier  at  Loanda,  from  which  the 
Bishop  used  to  bless  the  slave-ships. 

Tine  Work  of  Krapf  and  Livingstone. 

On  the  other  hand,  no  brighter  page  in  the  history 
of  modern  progress  can  be  found  than  that  entitled 
"  Central  Africa."  Two  missionaries,  above  all  others, 
have  given  us  a  vision  of  these  regions  as  one  mission- 
field;  men  who  simultaneously  opened  Africa  from 
different  sides.  It  is  impossible  not  to  notice  here,  in 
brief,  their  aims  and  lifework. 

Krapf  had  meant  to  penetrate  the  continent  from 
the  north — from  Abyssinia.  Foiled  in  this,  he 
sought  to  open  Africa  from  Mombasa  on  the  east. 
Landing  in  Mombasa  (1844),  he  seems  to  have  seen  a 
vision  of  Africa's  conversion,  for  he  speaks  propheti- 
cally, at  the  lonely  grave  of  his  wife  and  child  :  "  This  is 
a  sign  that  you  have  commenced  the  struggle ;  the 
hour  is  at  hand  when  you  are  summoned  to  the  con- 
version of  Africa  from  its  eastern  shore."  Again  but 
six  years  later  he  wrote  triumphantly  : — "  The  idea  of 
a  chain  of  missions  will  yet  be  taken  up  by  succeeding 


74  AFRICA    WAITING 


generations,  and  carried  out.  This  idea  I  bequeath  to 
every  miscionary  coming  to  East  Africa." 

Livingstone's  overmastering  thoughts  began  to  grow 
upon  him  in  1845.  We  find  him  saying :  "  Who 
will  penetrate  through  Africa?"  And  only  four 
years  afterwards  he  was  led  himself  across  the 
Kalahari  desert  by  Chief  Sech^le  to  see  the  great 
Sebituan^  in  the  unknown  regions  beyond.  After- 
wards when  ''the  spectre  of  the  slave-trade  had  en- 
larged his  horizon,  and  shown  him  the  necessity  of  a 
commercial  revolution  for  the  whole  of  Africa,"  we 
find  him  writing  home  in  confidence  to  the  L.M.S.  :— 
"  I  will  go,  no  matter  who  opposes."  So  David 
Livingstone  lived  to  see  the  eyes  of  Christendom 
begin  to  turn  upon  Africa  "  to  help  to  heal "  its  open 
sores. 

We  shall  see  how  Krapf's  suggestion  of  a  mission 
chain  is  being  realized  at  several  points  across  the 
continent,  also  how  Livingstone  prepared  the  way 
for  Africa's  redemption  from  social  sins.  But  every 
library  should  contain  the  treasured  volumes  of  Krapf's 
and  Livingstone's  "  Missionary  Travels." 

East  African  History. 

"  East  Africa,"  which  ordinarily  means  only  the 
middle  section  of  the  east  coast,  from  Cape  Guardafui 
to  the  mouth  of  the  Zambesi,  stretches  inland  to  30°  E. 
longitude,  and  includes  the  highest  mountains  and  the 
largest  lakes  in  the  whole  continent,  and  gives  rise  to 
three  out  of  the  four  great  African  rivers. 

The  East  Coast  has  enjoyed  for  many  ages  frequent 
intercourse  and  active  trade  with  Arabia  and  India. 
The  Portuguese  navigators  of  the  16th  century  found 
there  fairly  civilized  and  stable  Arab  governments. 
Under  Portuguese  rule  piracy  and  the  slave-trade  de- 
stroyed everything  else  ;  but  within  this  century  their 
influence  has  greatly  waned.  In  their  stead  sprang  up 
another  maritime  power,  with  its  centre  at  Muscat  on 
the  Persian  Gulf.     This  was  the  independent  and  enter- 


BANTU-LAND  :     CENTRAL   AFRICA  75 


prising  Mohammedan  st^.e  of  Oman  in  Eastern 
Arabia.  Seyyid  Said,  one  vi  their  Imams,  or  leaders 
(1804-56),  extended  his  power  over  the  East  African 
Coast,  and  transferred  the  seat  of  his  government 
from  Muscat  to  Zanzibar.  At  his  death  his  two  sons 
quarrelled  over  their  inheritance,  so  that  their  power  was 
divided,  and  consequently  weakened.  Lately  events 
have  happened  rapidly,  so  that  since  the  Berlin 
Conference  ^  the  Seyyid  (or  Sultan)  has  been  relieved  of 
all  his  possessions  on  the  mainland  and  the  adjacent 
islands,  except  Zanzibar  and  Pemba.  Lastly,  the 
Sultanate  itself,  reduced  to  a  total  area  of  less  than  1000 
square  miles,  was  declared  a  British  Protectorate  in 
July,  1890 ;  and  the  rest  of  East  Africa  was  divided 
between  Germany,  England,  and  Italy,  the  Portuguese 
retaining  the  coast  regions  south  of  the  Eovuma  river. 

Central  African  Exploration. 

Although  many  travellers  had  explored  the  Dark 
Continent  from  the  north,  south  and  west  coasts, 
none,  except  the  two  C.M.S.  missionaries,  Krapf 
and  Bebmann,  attempted  to  reach  the  interior  from 
the  eastern  side.  On  the  other  hand,  almost  all 
subsequent  great  journeys  of  discovery  were  begun 
from  Zanzibar.  Confessedly,  therefore,  the  chief 
impulse  given  to  "  Central  "  African  discovery  came 
from  the  travels  and  researches  of  missionaries. 

East  Africa. — When  Krapf  was  expelled  from 
Abyssinia  (March,  1838),  and  not  allowed  to  return  to 
Shoa  (Nov.,  1842),  he  sailed  from  Aden  in  an  Arab 
vessel  for  the  Zanzibar  coast,  and  landed  at  Mombasa 
on  Jan.  3rd,  1844.  After  paying  a  flying  visit  to 
Zanzibar,  he  returned  to  Mombasa,  armed  with  a 
letter  of  introduction  from  Seyyid  Said  to  his  governors 
and  people,  which  described  him  as  "  a  good  man  who 
wishes  to  convert  the  world  to  God."  Within  two 
months,  however,  he  laid  his  beloved  ones  in  a  lonely

grave — near  to  where  Frere  Town  stands  to-day. 
After  being  joined  by  Eebmann,  he  decided  to  make 
annual  journeys  into  the  interior.  First,  Eebmann 
discovered  Mount  KiHma-Njaro  (1848),  then  Krapf 
Mount  Kenia  (1849),  both  mountains  over  18,000  feet 
high,  and  perpetually  topped  with  snow.  Meanwhile, 
among  many  other  discoveries,  Krapf  heard  tell  from 
the  natives  of  "  a  great  lake  in  the  country  of  Unia- 
mesi."  "  Three  different  reports  being  given,  which 
spoke  of  it  as  the  Uker^we  to  the  north,  the  Tanganika 
or  Uniamwesi  in  the  centre,  and  the  Nianja  or  Niassa 
in  the  south,"  led  Eebmann  and  Erhadt  to  sketch  one 
gigantic  inland  sea,  800  miles  in  length.  A  copy  of 
the  map  can  be  seen  in  the  library  of  the  Eoyal  Geo- 
graphical Society.  This  astounding  revelation  led  to 
the  expedition  of  Burtoji  and  Spehe  (1858),  who 
discovered  this  sea  to  consist  of  at  least  two  parts — 
Lake  Tanganyika  in  the  centre  of  the  continent,  and  a 
northern  lake  called  Ukerewe,  which  Speke  visited  on 
the  return  march.  The  latter  he  named  Victoria 
Nyanza,  and  pronounced  to  be  the  principal  source  of 
the  Nile.  A  second  expedition  was  therefore  under- 
taken by  Spehe  and  Grant  (1861)  to  verify  this  asser- 
tion. It  was  then  that  the  western  shores  of  Lake 
Victoria  were  skirted,  and  the  Nile  was  proved  to  flow 
out  of  it  towards  the  north.  Eumanika,  king  of 
Karagwe,  and  the  greater  Mtesa,  king  of  Uganda,  now 
received  their  first  visit  from  white  men,  and  were 
anxious  to  further  their  acquaintance.  But  it  was 
twelve  years  before  another  European  stood  on  the 
shores  of  Lake  Victoria.  Meanwhile  Mr.  (afterwards 
Sir  Samuel)  Baker  had  advanced  to  meet  the  travellers 
from  the  north.  Having  met  them,  and  heard  from 
them  of  a  second  Nile  lake  unvisited,  he  and  his  wife 
continued  their  journey  southwards,  and  were  rewarded 
by  the  discovery  of  the  Muta  Nzige,  now  known  as  the 
Albert  Nyanza.  Thus  the  main  facts  about  the  sources 
of  the  Nile  were  made  known,  after  over  2000  years  of 
inquiry  and  conjecture. 
The  Congo  Basin.— The  western  half  of  Equa- 


BANTU-LAND  :    CENTRAL    AFRICA  77 

torial  Africa,  however,  still  remained  almost  a  blank 
on  the  map.  Livingstone  therefore  pet  out  again  on 
what  proved  to  be  his  last  journey.  Unfortunately  he 
clung  to  the  belief  that  the  ultimate  sources  of  the 
Nile  were  to  be  found  west  and  south  of  Lake  Tangan- 
yika. So  from  1866  till  his  death  in  1873  he  was 
endeavouring  to  find  a  connexion  between  the  rivers 
in  this  region,  which  all  flowed  northward,  and  the 
river  Nile.  The  furthest  point  north  which  he  dis- 
covered on  the  stream  Lualaba,  was  the  Arab  market 
of  Nyangwe,  then  their  chief  slave  depot  in  Central 
Africa;  for  to  the  north  of  this  was  an  exceedingly 
dense  forest  region,  into  which  he  felt  unable  to  pene- 
trate before  death  overtook  him.  Latterly  doubts  had 
sprung  up  in  his  mind  whether  he  had  not  struck  the 
head-waters  of  the  Congo,  the  great  size  of  which  had 
long  before  been  remarked  on.  This  view  was  adopted 
by  Cameron,  who  was  chosen  in  1873  to  carry  aid  to 
Livingstone.  Thus  when  he  had  met  Susi,  Chuma, 
and  Jacob  Wainwright  bearing  Livingstone's  embalmed 
remains  to  the  East  Coast,  he  pursued  his  journey  with 
.the  help  of  Livingstone's  instruments,  and  discovered 
an  outlet  to  the  lake  Tanganyika  among  the  wall  of 
mountains  on  its  west  shore.  Like  Livingstone,  he 
was  advised  at  Nyangwe  not  to  penetrate  the  northern 
forests,  and  so  made  his  way  in  a  south-westerly 
direction  to  Benguela  on  the  west  coast,  striking  the 
Congo  watershed  on  the  way. 

Then  followed  Stanley's  journeys — first  toUjiji(1871) 
to  relieve  Livingstone,  who  had  for  some  years  been 
lost  sight  of;  next,  in  1875,  to  solve  the  remaining 
problems  of  Central  African  geography.  In  the 
course  of  his  travels  he  circumnavigated  the  Victoria 
Nyanza,  presented  King  Mtesa  of  Uganda  with  a 
Swahili  New  Testament,  discovered  what  eleven  years 
afterwards  he  called  Lake  Albert  Edward,  re-examined 
Lake  Tanganyika  and  its  outlet,  reached  Nyangwe, 
and  determined  at  all  costs  to  follow  the  river  Lualaba 
northward  through  the-  forests.  With  only  a  few  of 
his  faithful  followers,  he  therefore  journeyed  through 


78  AFRICA    WAITING 


the  trackless  forests,  past  cataracts  and  warlike 
cannibals,  and  traced  the  Lualaba  round  its  great 
Dorthern  bend  until  it  brought  him  at  last  to  the 
known  part  of  the  Congo  close  to  the  Atlantic  Ocean. 
By  this  journey,  of  1000  days  save  one,  across  the  last 
really  important  unknown  area  on  the  surface  of  the 
globe  (excepting  only  the  polar  regions),  he  made 
known  1600  miles  of  the  course  of  Africa's  greatest 
river,  and  disclosed  the  second  greatest  fluvial  system 
m  the  world. 

Among  the  host  of  other  travellers  in  the  Congo 
regions,  Du  Chaillu,  an  American,  was  the  first  man  in 
modern  times  to  set  eyes  on  the  man-gorillas  and  the 
pigmy  dwarfs.  His  travels  were  confined  to  the  Gaboon 
and  (French)  Congo-land.  A  few  years  later  (1869-71) 
Schweinfurth  also  saw  some  Akka  pigmies,  studied 
the  lie  of  the  Nile-Congo  water-parting,  and  discovered 
the  river  Welle.  Junker's  travels  in  the  Bahr-el-Ghazal 
and  Nyam-Nyam  countries  were  of  equal  value,  but 
the  Mahdist  rising  in  1884  closed  the  upper  Nile 
region  to  him,  and  he  only  just  managed  to  escape  vid 
Uganda  to  the  East  Coast.  Grenfell,  the  Baptist 
missionary,  however,  navigated  the  Mobangi  (1884-5), 
and  Van  Gele  finally  showed  that  it  and  the  Welle  (of 
Schweinfurth)  were  one  and  the  same  (1887) ;  while 
Stanley  traced  the  Aruwimi  from  the  Congo  to  the 
highlands  west  of  the  Albert  Nyanza  (1887-8).  Turn- 
ing next  to  the  south  of  the  basin,  we  note  the  dis- 
coveries of  the  magnificent  Kassai-Sankuru  system  of 
rivers,  especially  those  by  Wissmann,  Von  Frangois, 
and  Grenfell,  while  Arnot  succeeded  in  opening  a  west 
and  east  route  from  the  Garenganze  highlands  to  the 
coast. 

Of  Other  East  African  explorers  the  late  Joseph 
Thomson  was  undoubtedly  the  ablest,  for  on  his  first 
journey  he  was  able  to  supplement  the  work  of  Living- 
stone, by  discovering  the  countries  to  the  north  of 
Nyasa  and  the  south  of  Tanganyika  (1878-80). 
In  1883-4  he  mapped  out  the  country  lying 
between  Mombasa  and  the  north-east  corner  of  the 


BANTU-LAND  :    CENTRAL   AFRICA  79 

Victoria  Nyanza,  including  the  northern  slopes  of 
Kilima-Njaro,  the  plateaux  of  Kikuyu,  and  the  lakes 
Naivasha,  Nakuro,  and  Baringo.  Thus  he  holds  the 
honour  of  having  opened  the  north  road  to  Lake 
Victoria,  which  is  now  being  covered  by  the  new 
railway. 

Water  Communication  in  Central  Africa. — As 
a  result  of  the  above  explorations,  Mr.  James  Stevenson 
tells  us  that  for  "6,000,000  square  miles  of  Central 
Africa,  there  are  three  main  lines  of  water  communi- 
cation actually  available,  each  reaching  directly  into 
the  centre  of  the  continent."  And  these  water  high- 
ways and  byways  extend  nearly  to  10,000  miles  as 
follows : — 

In  the  first  route,  starting  at  Chinde  and  the  mouth 
of  the  Zambesi,  there  are  over  200  miles  of  navigable 
river  up  the  Zambesi  and  the  Shir6.  Then  65  miles 
by  road  from  Katunga  to  Matope,  and  thence  over 
300  miles  on  Lake  Nyasa  to  Karonga.  Finally  210 
miles  by  road  to  Lake  Tanganyika,  which  itself  is 
400  miles  long.  In  all,  1000  miles  by  water  and  275 
by  road  are  open  for  trade  and  missionary  enter- 
prise. An  alternative  route — inland — is  that  via  the 
Zambesi  and  Kafue  rivers  to  Kayinga  in  the  Barotse 
country. 

In  the  second,  starting  at  Suakin,  we  reach  Berber 
by  camel  in  ten  to  thirteen  days  (280  miles).  Thence 
steamers  can  travel  for  1200  miles  to  Lado,  where  we 
are  within  5°  of  the  equator. 

In  the  third,  navigation  up  the  Congo  can  be  carried 
on  by  ocean  steamers  for  110  miles  to  Matadi.  Then 
come  200  miles  of  cataracts,  now  being  overcome 
by  a  railway  as  far  as  Stanley  Pool.  From  here  the 
main  stream  is  navigable  for  1100  miles  alone, 
besides  thousands  of  miles  of  tributaries,  among 
which  the  Lomami  and  the  Mobangi  are  the 
longest. 

Each  of  these  main  lines  of  waterway  have  now  been 
bridged  by  steamers,  and  each  of  them  are  being  kept 
open  to  all  nations  by  international  agreement. 


8o  AFRICA    WAITING 


The  Partition  of  Central  Africa. 

Livingstone's  travels  awakened  such  a  lively  and 
universal  interest  in  Africa,  that  the  International 
African  Association  was  established  in  1876,  and 
the  King  of  Belgium,  its  founder,  became  its  chosen 
head.  Stanley's  great  journey  down  the  Congo  re- 
sulted still  further  in  riveting  the  attention  of  Europe 
upon  "the  Dark  Continent."  In  Germany,  also,  an 
African  Association  was  formed  to  find  new  outlets 
to  the  growing  trade  and  emigration  from  Germany. 
This  led  to  the  annexation  of  Damara-land,  the 
Cameroon  country,  and  Togo-land  (1884).  Because  of 
this  Great  Britain  hastened  to  secure  control,  without 
delay,  over  the  Lower  Niger  and  the  Guinea  coast, 
where  British  traders  had  long  been  settled.  France 
also,  began  to  press  towards  the  Congo  from  the 
Gaboon,  to  which  Portugal  objected.  Therefore,  an 
International  Conference  at  BerHn  was  called  (1884) 
to  regulate  rules  for  the  "  Partition  of  Africa."  A 
"Free-trade  area"  was  defined,  embracing  a  zone  of 
the  continent  from  sea  to  sea,'  and  including  the  Congo 
basin,  with  the  adjacent  parts  of  the  Nile  and  the 
Zambesi.  At  this  time  also  the  Congo  Free  State 
was  formed,  but  it  has  since  completely  lost  its  inter- 
national character,  and  practically  become  a  Belgian 
dependency  under  the  rule  of  King  Leopold.  So  too 
in  East  Africa  British  and  German  spheres  of  influence 
were  mapped  out,  which  are  now  known  as  Imperial 
British  and  German  East  Africa. 

East  Africa  has  two  most  important  centres  to- 
day in  Zanzibar  and  Mombasa.  Each  name  stands 
for  an  island  and  a  town.  Zanzibar  Island  is  the 
largest  on  the  whole  coast,  50  miles  by  27,  with  a 
population  of  about  100,000.  The  town  of  Zanzibar 
faces  the  mainland  to  the  west,  distant  about  thirty 
miles,  and  now  enjoys  a  British  protectorate.  Mom- 
basa Island  is  less  than  three  miles  across,  and  close  to 
the  coast.  It  has  lately  become  the  depot  of  British 
East  Africa  and  the  starting  point  of  the  Uganda  rail-

way ;  hence  it  is  already  growing  in  importance,  and 
at  present  contains  about  40,000  people.  Like  Zan- 
zibar, Mombasa  is  peopled  mainly  by  Waswahili, 
Arabs,  Hindu  Banian  traders,  and  emancipated  slaves. 
They  are  also  both  of  special  interest,  because  Zanzibar 
is  the  headquarters  of  the  Universities'  Mission,  and 
Mombasa  of  the  C.M.S.  Mission. 

In  both  German  and  British  spheres  active  and 
costly  efforts  have  been  made  to  develop  the  country. 
A  German  East  Africa  Company  has  established  a 
chain  of  stations,  along  one  of  the  great  trade  routes 
into  the  interior,  from  Bagamoyo  to  the  Arab  mart  of 
Tabora  in  Unyanyembe.  Here  the  path  forks,  south- 
west to  Ujiji,  on  Lake  Tanganyika,  and  north-west 
round  the  west  shore  of  Lake  Victoria  to  Uganda. 
But  the  recent  decline  in  the  slave  and  ivory  trade  has 
made  this  route  less  important,  whereas  Dar-es-Salaam 
has  come  to  the  front,  and  will  soon  be  the  chief  port 
of  German  territory. 

The  Imperial  British  East  Africa  Company,  in 
1888-9,  opened  up  a  new  route  from  Mombasa  to 
the  north  of  Lake  Victoria — the  same  route  by  which 
Bishop  Hannington  travelled  (1885),  when  he  was  put 
to  death.  Forts  have  now  been  erected  as  far  as  the 
slopes  of  Mount  Euwenzori,  and  treaties  made  with 
interior  tribes.  The  railway  which  has  been  surveyed 
and  begun  at  Mombasa,  is  to  extend  as  far  as  the  lake, 
and  the  effect  of  these  extensions  of  British  and 
German  influence  have  already  done  much  to  arrest 
the  East  African  slave  trade  {vide  ch.  vii.). 

Native  Life  in  Central  Africa. 

The  Sparseness  of  Population. — Nothing  is 
more  striking  in  such  fertile  lands  as  Central  Africa 
contains,  than  the  small  population.  It  suggests  an 
endless  catalogue  of  evils  as  prevalent.  Mr.  Hoste, 
after  twelve  years  on  the  Congo,  thinks  that  "the 
whole  Congo  Free  State — a  territory  thirty  times  the 
size  of  England — contains  only  double  as  many  in- 
habitants as  London.     But  it  is  easy  to  under-estimate 

ft 


83  AFRICA    WAITING 

the  population  of  vast  forest  regions.  The  cHmate, 
also,  deadly  alike  to  foreigner  and  to  native,  presents  a 
problem  so  great  and  difficult  as  almost  to  defy  solu- 
tion. Draining  and  cultivation  is  needed  on  so  vast  a 
scale,  and  so  great  a  revolution  in  manner  and  habits 
of  living  is  demanded,  that  any  decided  improvement 
can  only  be  viewed  as  the  distant  result  of  a  spiritual, 
moral,  and  mental  renovation." 

Cannibalism. — There  can  be  no  doubt  that  canni- 
balism is  generally  abhorred  by  the  Africans,  and 
nearly  a  whole  tribe  has  been  known  to  die  of  hunger, 
without  a  single  instance  of  cannibalism  occurring. 
But  there  are  also  very  many  tribes  in  West  Central 
Africa  that  are  out-and-out  cannibals.  In  the  west  we 
find  that  the  Fangs  of  the  Gaboon  country  are  addicted 
to  this  habit,  and  Livingstone  describes  the  Manyema 
of  the  Lualaba  as  cannibals  also.  Many  tribes  up  the 
Mobangi  refuse  to  trade  in  any  other  article  except 
human  flesh,  while  a  Httle  further  north  Schweinfurth 
found  the  practice  terribly  prevalent  among  the  Nyam- 
Nyams.  This  is  all  the  more  remarkable  since  this 
race  is  such  an  exceedingly  fine  one,  and  great  affec- 
tion exists  between  husband  and  wife.  Another  tribe, 
called  the  Batetlas,  near  the  Welle  Biver,  habitually 
devour  their  parents  on  the  first  sign  of  decrepitude. 
Wars  are  constantly  undertaken  on  purpose  to  obtain 
meat.  While  in  the  recent  struggle  between  the 
Congo  Free  State  and  the  Arabs — a  war  practically  for 
the  mastery  of  the  interior  i  — the  native  auxiliaries  on 
each  side,  numbering  many  thousands,  fed  almost 
entirely  upon  the  killed  and  wounded. 

Superstition  devastates  the  land.  A  cardinal 
point  of  the  native  creed  is  that  sickness  and  death  are 
seldom,  if  ever,  due  to  natural  causes ;  therefore,  pro- 
tracted sickness  or  the  death  of  any  one  of  the  smallest 
importance  generally  involves  the  death  of  one  or 
more  victims,  who  are  accused  by  the  fetish  man  of 
using  magic  arts  for  the  invalid's  destruction.  Forms 
of  fetishism  are  to  be  found  everywhere,  which  are 
1  Cf.  Hinde  -FaU  of  the  Congo  Arabs  (1896). 


JANTU-LAND  :    CENTRAL   AFRICA  83 

used  either  to  propitiate  the  spirits,  or  to  enhst  their 
protection,  even  their  aid  in  designs  against  the  wel- 
fare of  others. 

Polygamy,  youthful  marriages,  and  so  on,  also 
militate  against  an  increase  in  population.  The 
marriage  bond  is  merely  a  financial  affair,  to  be  broken 
as  soon  as  a  husband  wearies  of  his  wife.  He  then 
returns  her  to  her  relatives  with  a  demand  for  repay- 
ment, with  interest,  of  the  presents  customarily  given 
on  the  occasion  of  marriage. 

Tribal  Political  Organization. — The  form  of 
government  indigenous  to  Africa  is  certainly  patri- 
archal, the  chief  being  the  lineal  descendant  of  the 
great  ancestor  of  the  tribe,  whose  spirit  is  worshipped. 
The  chief  is  also  high  priest.  Central  African  chiefs 
have  a  few  civil  officials,  who  are  honoured  with  such 
titles  as  "  the  king's  mat,"  "  the  king's  food  taster,"  or 
"■  the  king's  pipe  Hghter."  But  most  of  his  officials  are 
military  sub-chiefs,  and  the  country  is  divided  between 
them. 

Until  comparatively  recent  times  these  small  states 
were  all  able  to  keep  one  another  within  reasonable 
bounds.  All  being  equally  armed  with  spears  and 
clubs,  the  balance  of  power  was  maintained.  But 
when  some,  by  means  of  their  position  near  the  coast, 
or  by  their  enterprise  and  intelligence  in  entering 
into  friendly  relations  with  the  European  or  Arab 
trader,  were  able  to  secure  a  monopoly  of  the  gun  and 
powder  trade,  they  carved  out  for  themselves  large 
empires.  Muata-Yamvo,  king  of  the  Lunda  empire, 
and  Msidi,  of  the  Garenganze  country,  were  men  of 
this  kind.  The  latter  appointed  many  sub-chiefs, 
who  were  all  related  to  him  by  marriage,  and  they  in 
turn  were  looked  after  by  Msidi' s  Kalamas  (district 
officers).  Meanwhile  the  female  relative  of  the  district 
chief,  who  was  married  to  Msidi,  was  supposed  to 
represent  him  and  his  district  at  court.  Ingenious 
semi-Arabic  or  semi-Portuguese  organizations  were 
also  brought  into  existence  by  some  of  these  mush- 
room empires.

Absence  of  Caste  in  most  parts  of  Central  Africa 
is  very  marked.  A  slave,  though  liable  to  be  sold  at 
any  time,  suffers  no  personal  degradation  by  the  fact 
of  being  a  slave.  The  domestic  slavery  of  Central 
Africa,  in  spite  of  its  attendant  evils,  has  much  in  it 
to  commend  it  as  a  useful  institution  in  an  uncivilized 
Pagan  community ;  the  element  of  protection  for 
the  weak  by  the  strong  is  quite  the  salient  feature  of 
the  system.  Slaves  born  in  the  house  have  a  firm 
standing  in  the  family,  and  it  is  not  the  custom  to  sell 
such  except  under  very  pressing  circumstances  of  need 
or  debt.  The  bought  slave  is  less  secure,  liable  to  be 
sold  at  convenience  and  often  to  be  substituted  for 
punishment  in  the  event  of  his  owner  committing  a 
capital  crime.  The  recognition  of  a  slave's  right  to 
desert  and  seek  a  new  master  if  ill-treated  protects 
slaves  from  ill-usage.  The  above  remarks  are,  how- 
ever, exactly  the  reverse  of  the  truth  where  Islam  and 
Arab  slavery  prevail. 

The  Position  of  Women  in  Central  Africa  is 
quite  enviable  compared  with  the  lives  of  drudgery 
from  morning  till  night  of  hundreds  of  thousands  in 
Europe  and  America.  They  labour  in  the  field  as  a 
rule  from  choice,  not  compulsion.  Their  influence  in 
the  home  over  their  children,  and  often  over  their 
husbands  also,  is  very  great.  It  is  not  uncommon  to 
find  women  chiefs  of  tribes  and  villages,  and  the 
succession  always  runs  through  the  sister  to  the  king's 
nephew  rather  than  to  his  son.  Children  are  members 
of  their  mother's  family,  and  when  old  enough  to  shift 
for  themselves  are  handed  over  to  their  maternal 
relations. 

Africans  are  also  very  hospitable.  They  will  share 
the  last  morsel  with  their  friends,  and  often  provide 
for  the  entertainment  of  travellers  as  long  as  they 
are  in  their  country.  They  are  also  exceedingly  fond 
of  play,  and  full  of  spirits.  They  have  their  tops, 
balls,  kites,  slings,  and  rattles ;  they  race  and  wrestle 
and  are  born  mimics. 

Love  of  dancing  is  universal,  and  is  invariably 


BANTU-LAND  :    CENTRAL   AFRICA  85 

connected  with  an  affection  for  music.  Musical 
instruments  are  certainly  of  a  rough  order,  and  the 
sense  of  harmony  may  be  crude,  but  their  sense  of 
time  is  accurate,  even  to  performing  upon  drums 
and  thumping  away  by  day  and  hour.  In  a  dance 
a  hundred  feet  will  move  invariably  at  the  same 
instant.  Dances  are  of  two  kinds — those  playfully 
religious  and  those  seriously  religious.  But  the 
tendency  of  both  is  bad. 

Love  of  sublimity. — Africans  find  simple  deUght 
in  all  the  creatures  and  insects  of  the  universe  in  a 
way  unknown  among  the  peasantry  of  England.  In 
many  places,  however,  they  have  as  yet  no  words  to 
express  deUcate  shades  of  colour. 

Central  African  Missions. 

I.  East.  Early  C.M.S.  Efforts  (1844-74).— Krapf 

and  Eebmann,  like  Livingstone,  were  pioneers.  Like 
him  they  saw  little  direct  fruit  of  their  labours,  though 
Eebmann  remained  in  East  Africa  for  twenty-nine 
years  (1846-74)  without  once  coming  home.  The 
latter  was  found  by  Sir  Bartle  Frere  in  1873  at 
Kisulutini,  quite  blind,  but  immersed  in  his  diction- 
aries and  translations,  and  surrounded  by  a  few  faithful 
Wanika.  The  indirect  results,  however,  of  their  work 
have  been  immense,  for  they  have  led,  as  we  have 
seen,  to  all  Central  African  exploration.  Both  retired 
to  live  at  Kornthal  (in  Germany)  ;  Eebmann  living 
long  enough  to  hear  of  Stanley's  "  appeal  to  Christen- 
dom "  written  from  Uganda,  Krapf  even  witnessing 
the  occupation  of  Uganda  and  the  Congo  river  by 
missionaries. 

The  C.M.S.  Frere  Town  Settlement.— The 
year  1873  marks  the  date  of  the  death  of  Livingstone, 
and  the  request  from  Sir  Bartle  Frere  to  the  C.M.S. 
to  found  a  settlement  for  liberated  slaves  upon  the 
coast.  The  scheme  was  heartily  taken  up  during  the 
next  year,  as  soon  as  the  news  of  Livingstone's 
death  had  reached  the  world,  and  had  given  an  impetus 


86  AFRICA    WAITING 


to  all  missionary  enterprise.  An  experienced  Indian 
missionary,  Mr.  Price,  formerly  in  charge  of  the 
"  Nasik  Boys,"  was  sent  out  to  found  a  settlement 
near  Mombasa.  Some  150  African  Christians  were 
collected  to  form  the  nucleus  of  an  industrial  colony ; 
and  close  to  the  grave  of  Mrs.  Krapf  on  the  main- 
land, a  spot  was  chosen,  purchased,  and  named  Frere 
Town.  At  different  times  this  colony  has  been  in- 
creased by  the  introduction  of  slaves  rescued  by  H.M. 
cruisers.  Several  colonists  have  now  moved  on  to  the 
more  fertile  district  of  Eabai  (Kisulutini),  and  on  the 
whole  remarkable  progress  is  being  made. 

Since  then  the  work  has  extended  from  Mombasa 
with  varying  fortunes  into  the  Giryama  country  to  the 
north,  and  as  far  as  the  Sabaki  River ;  also  to  Taita, 
and  to  Taveta  on  the  southern  slopes  of  Kilima-Njaro. 

The  C.M.S.  Uganda  Mission. — On  November 
15th,  1875,  appeared  Stanley's  famous  letter  to  the 
Daily  Telegraph,  describing  his  intercourse  with  King 
Mtesa,  and  challenging  Christendom  to  send  mission- 
aries to  Uganda.  The  C.M.S.  at  once  responded,  and 
a  well- equipped  mission  party  went  forth  in  the  spring 
of  1876.  Nobody  thought  of  any  route  into  the  interior 
but  that  followed  by  Burton,  Speke,  Grant  and 
Stanley.  It  was  therefore  planned  that  the  highlands 
of  Usagara  should  be  occupied  permanently,  as  being 
on  the  way  to  Lake  Victoria ;  so,  about  180  and  220 
miles  inland,  Mamboia  and  Mwapwa  were  chosen  as 
stations.  The  first  missionaries  to  enter  Mtesa's  capital 
in  July,  1877,  were  Shergold  Smith  and  Wilson,  but 
the  early  and  chequered  history  of  Uganda  cannot  be 
dwelt  upon,  save  to  give  a  grateful  tribute  to  Alexander 
Mackay  for  his  life-work  (1878-90).  For  ten  years  he 
laboured  in  Uganda  (1878-87),  as  builder,  carpenter, 
smith,  wheelwright,  sanitary  engineer,  farmer,  gardener, 
printer,  surgeon  and  physician.  He  also  vigorously 
prosecuted  linguistic  work,  and  set  a  high  standard 
for  all  future  translations.  There  he  lived  till  Mtesa's 
death  in  1884,  through  Mwanga's  persecution  of  the 
early  converts  in  1885,  and  alone  from  1886-7  when 


BANTU-LAND :     CENTRAL   AFRICA  87 

not  allowed  to  leave  Uganda,  by  order  of  the  king. 
And  all  the  while  he  was  laying  deep  the  foundations 
of  the  Uganda  Mission.  In  1887,  he  left  Uganda  for 
Usambiro  on  the  southern  shores  of  the  lake,  full  of 
plans  for  future  work.  And  during  troublous  times, 
Mohammedan  conquests,  Mwanga's  banishment  and 
reinstatement,  he  laboured  on,  refusing  to  return  to 
England  till  other  men  came  out  to  take  his  place. 
In  1890  he  died  at  Usambiro,  and  was  buried  in  "  God's 
Acre  "  by  the  side  of  Bishop  Parker  and  other  pioneers. 

Three  Missionary  Bishops. — In  1880  the  diocese 
of  Eastern  Equatorial  Africa  was  formed.  It  has  since 
had  three  missionary  bishops  — Hannington,  Parker  and 
Tucker.  Bishop  Hannington  was  cruelly  murdered 
on  the  north  road  to  Uganda  (1885)  by  order  of  King 
Mwanga.  Bishop  Parker  died  at  Usambiro  (1887) 
only  four  months  after  his  arrival  at  the  south  of  Lake 
Victoria.  Bishop  Tucker,  since  his  appointment  (1890), 
has  paid  three  visits  to  Uganda,  and  round  his  diocese, 
which  takes  a  year  to  compass. 

Uganda  as  a  Missionary  Church. — The  kingdom 
of  Uganda  is  the  most  powerful,  the  best  organized, 
and  most  civilized  state  in  Central  Africa.  Its  position 
is  doubly  remarkable,  as  bordering  the  greatest  lake  in 
Africa,  and  forming  the  meeting  ground  of  three  great 
African  races  in  their  various  migrations.  The  ruHng 
race  in  Uganda  (known  as  Wahuma)  are  of  Hamitic 
descent.  The  Kavh^ondos  are  certainly  Negroes,  while 
all  the  other  tribes  are  members  of  the  Bantu  family  of 
the  Negro  race.  To  this  superior  race  the  Divine  call 
has  come  to  be  the  chief  evangelists  of  Central  Africa. 
With  a  population  about  the  same  as  Wales,  Uganda 
has  become  the  greatest  wonder  of  modern  Missions. 
Only  twenty  years  after  the  first  missionaries  set  foot 
in  the  country,  we  find  that  the  people  have  built 
27  large  and  400  small  churches,  have  sent  forth  700 
natives  to  be  teachers  in  the  country  districts  and 
missionaries  in  the  regions  beyond.  They  have  now 
the  whole  Luganda  Bible  in  the  hands  of  the  people, 
120,000  of  whom  are  learning  both  to  read  and  write. 


88  AFRICA    WAITING 


The  Native  Church  since  1893  has  become  fully 
developed  with  church  councils,  native  clergy,  com- 
municants, baptized  Christians  and  catechumenate, 
women's  work,  monthly  missionary  meetings,  and  now 
a  hospital  in  Mengo. 

Prior  to  the  death  of  Livingstone,  the  work  on  the 
East  Coast  was  shared  with  the  C.M.S.  by  Three 
Other  Missions  —  the  Universities'  Mission,  the 
Swedish  Mission,  and  the  United  Methodist  Free  Church. 
The  third  of  these  began  in  1861,  and  despatched  four 
men,  with  Krapf ,  the  German  apostle,  as  leader.  'They 
chose  the  Galla  country  as  their  field,  and  though 
murder,  sickness  and  death  has  visited  them,  their 
stations  at  Golbanti  and  Eib^  are  now  full  of  promise. 
The  Swedish  Mission  (1865)  was  also  started  upon 
the  advice  of  Dr.  Krapf.  A  Medical  and  Industrial 
Mission  is  carried  on  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Lamu 
on  the  Tana  river,  in  addition  to  direct  evangelistic 
work. 

The  Universities'  Mission  to  Central  Africa 
owes  its  origin  to  Livingstone's  appeals  to  Oxford  and 
Cambridge  in  1857.  The  next  year  Bishop  Gray,  of 
Cape  Town,  on  a  visit  home,  kindled  the  growing  zeal, 
and  in  1859  a  devoted  leader  for  the  Mission  was  found 
in  Archdeacon  Mackenzie,  of  Natal,  a  very  able  Cam- 
bridge man.  Under  Mackenzie,  who  was  consecrated 
Bishop  at  Cape  Town  on  his  way  out,  a  strong  party 
ascended  the  Zambesi  and  Shire,  accompanied  by 
Livingstone  himself,  in  1860.  Following  his  advice, 
the  site  of  Magomero,  on  the  Shire  highlands,  was 
selected,  and  slaves  released  then  formed  a  nucleus 
for  a  Mission.  Tribal  wars,  and  the  climate,  however, 
proved  very  serious  obstacles,  so  that,  within  two 
years,  the  Bishop  and  three  of  his  companions  were 
dead,  and  all  but  one  were  invalided  home. 

The  next  Bishop,  Dr.  Tozer,  abandoned  the  Zambesi 
and  established  the  Mission  at  Zanzibar,  as  being  more 
central  (1864).  He  devoted  ten  years  to  the  founda- 
tion work  of  training  released  slave-children  for  future 
usefulness.     The  master-builder  of  the  Mission  was 


BANTU-LAND  :    CENTRAL   AFRICA  89 

Bishop  Steere.  He  had  aheady  worked  with  Tozer 
from  the  beginning,  and  altogether  this  wonderful  and 
determined  man  spent  nearly  twenty  years  (1863-82) 
at  translational  work.  During  this  time  he  translated 
the  whole  New  Testament,  a  large  part  of  the  Old 
Testament,  and  the  Book  of  Common  Prayer  into 
Swahili,  besides  a  primer,  stories,  dictionaries,  the 
"  Pilgrim's  Progress,"  and  theological  books.  He  just 
completed  the  Prophet  Isaiah  on  his  death-bed. 

Steere  also  witnessed  a  transformation  scene  on 
the  island  of  Zanzibar.  It  was  his  inspired  idea  to 
purchase  the  great  slave-market  (1873),  and  to  build 
thereon  the  first  East  African  Cathedral  with  its  coral 
roof.  Its  clock,  the  Sultan's  gift,  strikes  Eastern  time. 
He  it  was  that  planned  the  extension  of  the  Mission 
to  the  mainland.  First  Magila,  in  Usambara,  was 
planted  (1867),  till  now  five  other  stations  cluster 
round  this  Christian  settlement  and  industrial  centre 
for  freed  slaves.  Second,  Masasi,  a  half-way  house  to 
Lake  Nyasa,  was  founded  (1876),  and  to-day  the 
traveller  meets  with  several  Christian  villages  along 
the  banks  of  the  Eovuma. 

The  year  1882  brought  the  death  of  Bishop  Steere, 
and  Chuma,  one  of  Livingstone's  pall-bearers.  But 
1883  opened  more  brightly,  for  David  Susi  was  bap- 
tized at  Zanzibar — at  last  become  a  Christian,  more 
than  twenty  years  after  he  first  met  Livingstone. 
Nothing,  too,  is  more  remarkable  than  the  wisdom  of 
the  choice  of  Steere's  successor.  Bishop  Smythies 
was  just  the  kind  of  leader  needed  in  1883.  Within  four 
years  his  staff  of  workers  had  doubled,  and  was  being 
wisely  guided  to  develop  all  the  work.  The  very  year 
after  reaching  Zanzibar,  he  succeeded  in  placing  the 
Charles  Janson  on  Lake  Nyasa,  and  opened  work  there 
at  Likoma  Island.  Five  times  he  visited  this  lake 
between  1885  and  1891,  until  a  separate  Bishop  of 
Nyasaland  was  appointed  (1892).  In  1887  he  saw  a 
Theological  College  founded  at  Kiungani  in  memory  of 
Bishop  Steere,  and  in  1891  a  Mission  hospital  in 
Zanzibar.     Ten  natives  are  now  in  Holy  Orders,  all 


90  AFR ICA    JVA ITING 


trained  at  this  college.  Work  among  girls  is  carried 
on  by  ladies  in  Zanzibar,  while  others  reached  Likoma 
Island,  on  Nyasa,  in  1888.  More  recently  Bishop 
Smythies  died  at  sea,  and  was  buried  in  the  Indian 
Ocean  on  a  summer's  eve  (1894),  while  Bishop  Maples 
was  drowned  in  Lake  Nyasa  (1896).  In  spite  of 
all  this  sacrifice  of  lives,  God  has  raised  up  more 
labourers.  Thus  nearly  300  workers  have  gone  forth 
in  less  than  forty  years,  and  sixty-six  of  these  have 
died  in  harness. 

German  Missions, — In  recent  years  Germany  has 
begun  to  enter  East  Africa,  till  it  is  now  represented 
by  four  missionary  societies.  The  Evangelical  Mission 
(Berlin  III.)  started  work  in  Dar-es-Salaam  (1886). 
The  stations  have  extended  in  two  directions  from  two 
starting  points  on  the  coast.  From  Dar-es-Salaam 
advance  has  been  made  into  Usaramo,  where  at 
Kisserawe  a  liberated  slaves'  station  was  founded. 
From  Tanga,  the  coastal  terminus  of  a  short  railway, 
the  Mission  has  extended  to  the  hill-country  of 
Usambara,  where  several  stations  are  founded.  But 
disease  and  death  have  caused  great  losses  to  this 
flourishing  Mission. 

In  1891  the  Berlin  (I.)  Mission  and  the  Moravians 
both  began  to  occupy  German  territory,  on  the 
northern  side  of  Lake  Nyasa,  in  Kondeland.  The 
former  have  picked  an  idyllic  spot  for  their  work 
under  the  guidance  of  their  able  leader,  Mr.  Merensky. 
They  have  now  five  stations  and  nine  agents  on  the 
slopes  of  the  Livingstone  mountains  and  among  Konde 
tribes — with  their  *'  extensive  banana-groves,  well-kept 
roads,  homely  comfortable  cottages,  and  large  cow- stalls 
all  clean  and  neat."  The  latter  have  settled  further  to 
the  north-west  of  the  lake,  and  have  been  most  success- 
ful in  teaching  the  natives  to  build  houses  and  cultivate 
the  fields.  They  are  now  also  taking  over  Urambo, 
the  isolated  L.M.S.  station  in  Unyamesi,  on  the  old 
caravan  route  from  Ujiji  to  the  coast. 

Lastly,  the  Evangelical  Lutheran  (Leipzig)  Mission 
have  occupied  the   southern   slopes   of  Kilima-Njaro 


BANTU-LAND  :   CENTRAL   AFRICA  9 1 

in  the  Chagga  country  (1893).  They  have  three 
stations  close  to  the  old  C.M.S.  station  of  Mochi, 
which  was  vacated  by  Mr.  Steggall  (1892),  at  the 
advice  of  Sir  Gerald  Portal,  owing  to  some  misunder- 
standing of  German  officers  as  to  Steggall's  intentions. 
Two  young  missionaries  were  murdered  on  Meru  hill 
(1897),  when  trying  to  found  a  fourth  station  in  the 
Arooshi. 

The  Swahili  People  and  Language. 

All  along  the  East  Coast,  from  Magadosha  in  the  north 
to  Mozambique  in  the  south,  the  dominant  people  are  a 
mixed  race.  They  are  called  Swahili,  from  Sahel,  the 
Arabic  for  ''coast,"  and  are  zealous  Mohammedans. 
The  Swahili  language  is  of  Bantu  origin,  but  has 
been  largely  modified  by  the  influence  of  Arabic, 
Persian,  and  Portuguese,  and  holds  a  somewhat 
similar  position  throughout  East  Africa  to  that  of  Urdu 
in  North  India.  It  is  spoken  by  three  groups  of  peoples, 
around  Lamu,  Mombasa,  and  Zanzibar.  Until  quite 
recently  the  last  had  the  greatest  influence,  because 
nearly  all  porters  up  country  were  Zanzibaris,  and  they 
carried  the  language  wherever  they  went.  Cameron 
found  that  Swahili  took  him  almost  across  the  con- 
tinent, and  the  Gospel  was  preached  in  it  at  Mtesa's 
court.  But  since  the  British  Government  have  made 
Mombasa  their  headquarters  in  East  Africa,  the  Mom- 
basa dialect — acknowledged  to  be  the  most  beautiful 
of  all — will  probably  become,  in  time,  as  widely  spoken. 

Swahili  Scripture  Versions. — Krapf  was  the 
first  to  translate,  though  not  to  publish,  parts  of  the 
Scriptures  into  Swahili,  but  his  work  has  been  largely 
superseded  by  Bishop  Steere  and  his  successors. 
Zanzibar  has  now  the  whole  Bible  in  a  revised  form 
of  Steere's  version,  chiefly  due  to  the  labours  of 
Messrs.  Hodgson  and  Madan.  This  version  has 
hitherto  been  used  both  by  the  C.M.S.  and  the 
German  Missions  in  East  Africa.  Now,  however,  Mr. 
Taylor  has  found  it  necessary  to  make  a  more  idio- 
matic  version   of    St.    Luke   and    St.    John,    in  both 


9,2  AFRICA    WAITING 


Boman  and  Arabic  character,  for  the  Mombasa 
Mission.  The  Swahih  language  is  therefore  an  ex- 
cellent example  of  what  has  been  going  on  all  over 
Africa.  Already  it  seems  that  this  language  of 
modern  date  is  hkely  to  develop  into  two  distinct 
types. 

2.  West.  Gaboon  Missions. — In  the  north- 
west corner  of  Central  Africa  the  French  Evangelical 
Mission  and  the  American  Presbyterians  are  now  at 
work.  The  work  of  the  former  is  confined  to  French 
territory,  and  is  small  at  present.  That,  however,  of 
the  latter  is  excellent.  Notwithstanding  the  badness 
of  the  climate,  one  lady,  Mrs.  Eeutlinger,  has  just 
completed  36  years  of  service. 

Batanga,  the  starting  point  for  the  interior,  is  in- 
cluded in  German  territory.  Near  to  this  place  Mr. 
Eoberts  has  visited  some  (pigmy)  dwarfs  in  eight 
places.  An  account  of  these  dwarfs  written  by  Mr. 
Good  in  "  The  Church  at  Home  and  Abroad  "  has  led 
Miss  Maclean,  of  Glasgow,  to  give  ample  funds  towards 
evangelizing  them.  Three  promising  dwarf  lads  are 
already  to  be  found  in  the  Batanga  boarding-school. 

The  whole  N.T.  and  parts  of  the  O.T.  are  now 
translated  into  the  Benga  tongue.  And  Mr.  Marling 
(1880-96)  had  just  given  Genesis  and  Matthew  to  the 
powerful  Fang  tribe  before  he  died.  The  standard  of 
Christian  hfe  among  the  converts  is  still  very  low,  but 
there  are  signs  of  a  coming  harvest.  The  Kombe 
king  is  a  Christian,  and  has  already  made  some  better 
marriage  laws.  A  converted  Balingi  woman  has  also 
become  a  winner  of  souls,  while  the  inquirers  at 
Efalen  have  decided  to  send  out  Christian  lads  by  two 
and  two  into  the  villages  preaching. 

Missions  on  the  Congo. — Mission  work  in  face 
of  indescribable  difficulties  has  been  undertaken  and 
nobly  maintained  in  the  Congo  Free  State.  In  1877 
the  English  Baptist  Missionary  Society  and  the 
Livingstone  Inland  Mission,  started  by  Mrs.  Grattan 
Guinness,  responded  to  the  cry  which  came  forth 
from  this  newly  unveiled  world.    Both  these  Missions 


BANTU-LAND  :    CENTRAL   AFRICA  93 

successfully  accomplished  the  arduous  task  of  throw- 
ing lines  of  transport  stations  across  the  Cataract 
region  of  the  Congo,  and  are  now  firmly  established 
in  the  interior.  We  are  thankful  to  add  that  these 
stations,  in  addition  to  fulfilling  their  original  purpose, 
have  become  bright  centres  of  Christian  work.  St. 
Salvador,  Banza  Manteka,  Lukunga,  and  Wathen, 
have  been  notable  as  scenes  of  glorious  works  of 
grace.  The  English  Baptist  Mission  have  now  a  line 
of  8  stations  reaching  right  away  to  Stanley  Falls. 
The  Livingstone  Inland  Mission  (subsequently  handed 
over  to  the  American  Baptist  Missionary  Union)  has  a 
line  of  10  stations  extending  to  the  point  where  the 
Congo  crosses  the  Equator  on  its  southern  course. 
These  Missions  have  been  almost  swept  away,  time 
and  time  again,  by  the  ravages  of  climate.  Thirty  per 
cent,  of  the  missionaries  sent  out  have  succumbed, 
but  God  has  rapidly  raised  up  fresh  men,  who  have 
gladly  filled  the  diminished  ranks. 

The  Seventh-day  Baptists  have  1  station  at  the 
mouth  of  the  river  with  2  missionaries.  The  Swedish 
Mission  Union,  originally  affiliated  with  the  Livingstone 
Inland  Mission,  have  a  prosperous  work  above  the 
north  bank  of  the  river  in  the  Cataract  region.  They 
have  established  4  stations  with  a  working  staff  of 
33  missionaries.  This  Mission,  in  common  with 
all  others,  has  suffered  severely  from  the  climate  by 
death  and  sickness,  having  lost  17  workers  during 
the  last  10  years.  The  International  Missionary 
Alliance,  under  the  direction  of  A.  B.  Simpson,  of 
New  York,  is  working  in  the  same  region  as  the 
above,  and  has  a  staff  of  58  missionaries  working  at 
9  stations.  Bishop  Taylor's  Mission  has  2  stations 
with  3  missionaries.  One  station  at  the  mouth 
of  the  river,  among  the  creeks  in  the  vicinity  of 
Banana,  has  been  held  single-handed  for  about  10 
years  by  a  lady  named  Miss  Kildare,  and  does  a 
flourishing  little  work.  Ascending  once  more  to  the 
upper  river,  we  find  the  American  Southern  Presby- 
terian   Mission  working    on  the  Kassai  amongst  the 


94  AFRICA    WAITING 


Baluba  tribe  with  1  station  and  9  missionaries.  A 
little  higher  up,  just  in  the  centre  of  the  great  horse- 
shoe bend  of  the  Congo,  the  Co7igo  Balolo  Mission 
is  working.  This  Mission  was  established  in  1889, 
and  has  now  4  stations  on  the  Lulanga  Eiver  and  its 
tributaries,  with  a  staff  of  31  missionaries.  It  is  not 
confined  to  any  one  denomination.  Stations  established 
and  used  purely  as  transport  stations  have  been  omitted 
from  the  above  statement,  as  the  railway  across  the 
Cataract  region,  which  is  rapidly  advancing  towards 
completion  at  Stanley  Pool,  will  render  them  useless. 
It  should  be  mentioned  that  besides  smaller  boats, 
there  are  4  large  mission  steamers  in  the  interior,  two 
of  which  belong  to  the  English  Baptist  Mission,  one 
to  the  American  Baptist  Missionary  Union,  and  one 
to  the  Congo  Balolo  Mission. 

The  above  statistics  will  tend  to  mislead,  unless  it 
is  kept  in  view  that  in  addition  to  losses  by  death,  a 
large  percentage  of  missionaries  are  always  of  necessity 
on  sick  leave,  and  again,  that  through  the  special 
exigencies  of  these  missions,  so  many  of  the  members 
are  always  new  men  sent  out  to  fill  up  the  ranks  left 
open  by  the  victims  of  the  climate  ;  therefore  out  of  the 
212  missionaries  cited  above,  probably  never  more  than 
100  are  really  effective.  Quite  half  of  these  are  work- 
ing in  the  Cataract  or  Lower  Congo  region  below 
Stanley  Pool,  leaving  only  50  missionaries  at  the  most, 
effectively  reaching  all  those  millions  inhabiting  the 
country  which  we  are  accustomed  to  call  the  new 
world  of  Central  Africa. 

Again,  in  the  region  beyond  Stanley  Falls,  there  is  a 
country  400,000  square  miles  in  area  without  one  single 
Protestant  missionary,  and  as  yet  no  attempt  is  on  foot 
to  reach  this  country  with  the  Gospel.  The  poverty  and 
the  possibilities  of  Central  Africa  are  both  very  great. 
On  the  one  hand,  it  is  a  world  going  to  pieces,  physi- 
cally, mentally,  morally  and  spiritually,  through  neglect. 
On  the  other  hand,  though  rotting  before  our  eyes,  it 
is  the  most  fertile  country  in  the  world,  and  in- 
habited by  a  most  prolific  race. 


BANTU-LAND  :    CENTRAL    AFRICA  95 

Angola  Missions. — Lastly,  we  turn  to  missions  in 
the  South-west  corner  of  Central  Africa.  Here  the 
American  Board  of  Foreign  Missions  started  work 
on  the  healthy  highlands  of  Bailundu  and  Bihe  in 
1880.  Messrs.  Stover  and  Sanders  have  been  espe- 
cially successful  in  translational  work,  as  Umbundu, 
the  language  of  Bihe,  is  understood  inland  both  in  the 
Luvale  and  Garenganze  countries.  The  work  of  Mr. 
Currie,  a  Canadian,  at  Chisamba  has  also  been  re- 
markable. 

After  the  Methodist  Episcopal  Conference  of  1884 
Bishop  Taylor  led  out  a  party  of  forty-four  men, 
women,  and  children  to  Angola.  A  few  stations  were 
opened  in  the  interior,  the  idea  being  for  the  mission- 
aries to  support  themselves  by  some  trade — educational, 
agricultural,  or  medical.  But  the  Mission  has  by  no 
means  proved  to  be  a  success. 

No  Mission  has  been  more  scientifically  begun 
than  the  work  of  Mr.  Arnot  and  his  fellow-labourers  in 
Bihe  and  Garenganze.  Mr.  Arnot  himself  started 
from  Natal,  in  1881,  into  the  interior,  with  the  object, 
first  of  discovering  the  healthiest  part  of  the  continent, 
and  second,  of  getting  beyond  the  line  of  work  of 
other  missionaries.  When  he  reached  Benguela  he 
therefore  turned  back  again  eastward  along  the  water- 
shed dividing  the  Zambesi  and  Congo  river  systems, 
till  he  arrived  at  Garenganze,  or  Katanga  country. 
Here  two  stations  have  been  started  in  the  very 
heart  of  the  continent,  in  the  healthy  highlands,  with 
a  prospect  of  a  great  ingathering  of  souls.  The  diffi- 
culties of  transport  have  been  overcome  by  training  the 
native  porters  to  principles  of  free  labour.  Communi- 
catioDS  and  supphes  to  Garenganze  come  via  the 
Zambesi  and  Lake  Nyasa,  while  westerly  stations 
in  the  Bihe  and  Luvale  countries  receive  their  supplies 
via  Benguela.

CHAPTEE  VI. 

SOUTH   AFRICA  AND   BRITISH   CENTRAL   AFRICA. 

*'  The  story  of  South  Africa  is  unique  in  the  chronicles 
of  colonization.  For  a  century  and  a  half  (1487 — 1652) 
it  is  a  barren  record  of  a  landmark — the  Cape.  For 
another  century  and  a  half  (1652 — 1805)  it  is  Uttle 
more  than  the  story  of  a  port  of  call,  round  which  a 
small  settlement  gathered.  It  is  now  the  unfinished 
tale  of  a  wide  dominion."  ^ 

These  three  periods  mark  the  duration  of  Portuguese, 
Dutch  and  British  ascendency  in  these  southern 
regions.  The  Portuguese  did  nothing  further  than  to 
discover  the  Cape  of  Good  Hope  and  Saldanha  (now 
Table)  Bay.  The  Dutch,  considering  the  size  of  the 
Netherlands,  have  made  a  wonderfully  permanent 
impression  upon  the  religion,  the  language,  the  laws 
and  the  customs  of  this  land  of  the  South.  The 
British  have  opened  up  the  wealth  and  resources  of 
the  continent,  and  were  the  first  to  show  how  rightly 
to  protect  and  appreciate  the  Native  Eaces.  They 
have  also  led  the  way  in  exploration  of  the  interior. 

The  history  and  geography  of  South  Africa  are  too 
closely  studied  nowadays  to  need  space  in  such  a  book 
as  this.     We  pass  on  therefore  to  notice 

The  Native  Races  of  South  Africa. — There 
are  three  native  races  in  South  Africa,  the  Bantus,  the 
Hottentots,  and  the  Bushmen.  The  many  tribes  of 
the  great  Bantu  family  extend  from  the  Equator  to 

*  Lncas:  Hist.  Geog.  of  the  British  Colonies.  Vol.  IV., 
Part  I.,  p.  1. 


98  AFRICA    WAITING 

the  south-eastern  shores  of  the  Cape  Colony.  The 
southern  offshoots  of  their  stock,  commonly  known  as 
Kaffirs,  Zulus,  Matabele,  Bechuanas,  Basutos,  Pondos, 
Tembus,  and  others,  are  all  now  familiar  to  Europeans  ; 
but  in  the  seventeenth  century  they  had  not  crossed 
the  white  man's  path.  They  were  moving  down  from 
north  and  east,  while  the  Dutchmen  were  slowly 
coming  in  from  the  south,  and  the  meeting  and 
conflict  of  races  had  not  yet  come. 

The  sphere  of  the  Hottentots  was,  and  is,  the  south- 
west corner  of  Africa,  including  the  Cape  peninsula. 
Between  and  among  the  Hottentots  and  the  Kaffirs, 
mainly  in  the  desert  regions,  roamed  the  Bushmen,  a 
diminutive  aboriginal  race,  the  outcasts  of  South  Africa, 
untameable  savages  dwelling  in  holes  and  corners  of 
the  land.  They  lived  by  hunting  and  plunder. 
Hottentots  and  Kaffirs  alike  sought  to  kill  them  when- 
ever they  came  within  their  reach,  and  in  the  eyes 
of  the  white  men  they  were  mischievous  vermin  that 
literally  poisoned  the  soil. 

It  was  with  the  Hottentots  that  the  Dutch  had  to 
deal.  Though  higher  in  the  scale  of  humanity  than 
the  Australian  aborigines,  they  were  distinctly  below 
the  level  of  the  North  American  Indians.  In  character, 
they  were  neither  a  warlike  nor  a  working,  but  a 
thievish  race,  so  that,  by  being  brought  into  contact 
with  such  a  race,  the  Dutch  settlers  of  necessity 
deteriorated  in  course  of  time.  When,  however,  the 
Hottentots  resented  the  appropriation  of  their  lands 
by  an  alien  race,  it  is  important  to  notice  that  two 
agreements  were  signed  by  which  the  Cape  was 
bought  from  them  by  the  Dutch. 

The  Huguenot  Immigration. — The  first  Dutch 
commander  to  make  South  Africa  his  home  was  Simon 
Van  der  Stel,  and  the  wish  of  his  heart  was  to  make 
the  Cape  a  great  Dutch  colony.  It  was  he  who 
settled  at  the  spot,  now  so  well  known  as  Stellenbosch. 
It  was  his  representation  which  brought  several 
French  and  Piedmontese  fugitives,  all  of  the  reformed 
religion,  only  eight  years  later  (1687).     South  Africa, 


SOUTH  AFRICA    AND   BRITISH  CENTRAL   AFRICA       99 

as  well  as  Protestant  Europe,  has  gained  by  the  French 
persecution  of  Huguenots,  who  were  some  of  her  best 
citizens  that  France  might  have  kept.  They  brought 
with  them  better  modes  of  husbandry  and  a  knowledge 
of  arts  and  manufactures.  They  taught  the  Dutch  ex- 
soldiers  and  sailors  the  art  of  agriculture,  and  helped 
to  raise  the  standard  of  the  colonists.  They  made 
South  Africa  their  home,  and  at  the  same  time 
became  rapidly  absorbed  with  the  Dutch.  So  that 
to-day  French  names  are  borne  by  many  leading 
families  in  South  Africa. 

Trekking  has  been  the  main  feature  of  South 
African  colonization,  and  consists  in  perpetual  emigra- 
tion from  settled  to  unsettled  districts.  The  geography 
of  the  country  has  been  partly  responsible  for  this, 
but  it  has  also  arisen  from  a  desire  to  obtain  cheaper 
and  better  land.  It  has  been  further  fostered  by 
the  actions  of  the  Government.  Thus  from  early 
times  men  began  to  wander  from  headquarters,  and 
a  race  of  farmers  grew  up,  accustomed  to  isolation, 
strong,  and  independent,  but  losing  in  great  measure 
the  power  of  cohesion  for  political,  social  and  rehgious 
purposes. 

Contact  with  the  Natives. — The  farther  the 
colonists  went  afield,  the  more  they  came  into  oollisioQ 
with  the  Bushmen  on  the  west,  and  the  Kaffir  tribes 
on  the  east.  As  to  the  Bushmen,  no  people,  black  or 
white,  befriended  them.  But  the  Kaffirs,  like  the 
Dutchmen,  were  constantly  pressing  forward,  exter- 
minating the  Bushmen  as  they  went,  and  crushing  or 
assimilating  the  Hottentots.  They  were  bound,  there- 
fore, very  soon  to  come  into  contact  with  the  colonists, 
and  the  last  twenty  years  of  the  eighteenth  century 
saw  the  commencement  of  those  border  wars  which, 
once  begun,  lasted  for  exactly  a  hundred  years. 

Scmth  African  Missions. 

The   missionary  history  of  South  Africa   defies   all 
efforts  at  condensation.     It  is  so  full  that  it  is  only 
H  2

possible  in  general  to  give  a  short  introduction  to  the 
work  of  the  leading  missionary  societies.  Christian 
colonization  will  be  treated  only  in  its  relation  to 
evangelistic  work.  It  is  necessary  therefore  to  begin 
by  explaining  the  bearing  that  South  African  Missions 
have  had  upon  the  history  of  European  immigration. 

Protestant  Missionary  Enterprise. — It  has 
been  exceedingly  well  pointed  out  that  ''  South  Africa 
is  a  Teuton  colony  and  a  Protestant  land."  As  we 
have  seen,  Dutchmen,  Englishmen,  and  to  a  small 
extent  Germans,  have  entered  and  multiplied  here. 
The  only  other  strain  of  any  importance  has  been  that 
of  the  French  Huguenots.  Opinions  may  differ  as  to 
whether  or  not  South  Africa  will  be  the  better  for 
this,  but  it  is  well  to  remember  the  fact.  Again,  Dutch 
and  French  Calvinism,  British  Evangelical  Protes- 
tantism, and  German  Lutheranism  have  been  the  main 
creeds.  The  chief  missionaries  have  been  Moravians, 
members  of  the  London  Missionary  Society,  Wes- 
leyans,  Scotch  Presbyterians,  Enghsh  Episcopalians, 
French  Protestants  in  Basutoland,  Rhenish  mis- 
sionaries amongst  the  Namaquas  and  Damaras,  Berlin 
missionaries  all  over  South-East  Africa,  and  Norwegian 
missionaries  amongst  the  Zulus.  Only  of  late  years 
have  any  Eoman  Catholic  missionaries  been  in  the 
field.  Whoever  therefore  wishes  to  study  and  to 
record  the  missionary  efforts  of  Protestantism,  will 
certainly  turn  his  attention  to  South  Africa. 

The  Missionary  and  the  Colonist. — Further, 
whoever  wishes  to  study  and  to  record  the  share  which 
missionaries  have  had  in  making  history,  will  likewise 
turn  to  Africa.  Protection  of  the  natives  has  been 
their  aim ;  so  that,  before  the  Dutchmen  trekked  into 
the  interior,  their  voice  was  against  further  annexation 
of  territory  by  the  Government,  but  latterly  they  have 
felt  that  security  for  the  natives  would  best  be  gained 
by  extension  of  British  rule. 

It  is  not  for  us  to  judge  between  colonist  and 
missionary,  save  to  deplore  the  fact  that  in  the  past  so 
much  bad  feeling  between  the  two  has  existed.     We 


SOUTH  AFRICA    AND    BRITISH  CENTRAL    AFRICA      lOI 

cannot  but  feel  great  admiration  for  the  long  and  noble 
line  of  missionaries,  who  almost  without  exception 
were  able  as  well  as  enthusiastic  men.  They  repre- 
sented the  new  spirit  of  philanthropy  and  religious 
zeal  which  had  begun  to  be  aroused  in  Europe.  They 
were  Bible  Christians  like  the  colonists,  and  so  only 
pleaded  that  the  preaching  to  the  natives  should  be 
of  the  same  type  of  Christianity  as  they  found 
already  planted  in  the  land. 

On  the  other  hand,  rightly  or  wrongly,  to  the 
influence  of  the  missionaries  has  been  attributed  the 
trekking  of  the  Dutch  Boers,  principally  between 
1834  and  1854.  These  farmers  felt  that  they  had 
been  maligned  and  ill-treated  in  their  old  homes, 
because  the  Government,  inspired  by  missionary 
prejudice,  had  dealt  with  them  hardly.  This  resulted 
in  a  long-standing  ill-feeling  towards  the  missionaries. 
It  is  also  questionable  whether  the  Boer  emigration 
was  a  gain  or  a  loss.  It  certainly  carried  European 
settlement  and  influence  far  inland,  and  led  to  the 
founding  of  new  colonies  and  the  occupation  of  new 
territories.  But  it  also  weakened  the  older  colony 
itself,  and  caused  fresh  complications  with  Native 
races.  Surely  considerable  sacrifices  should  have 
been  made  to  the  Dutch  to  avoid  producing  a 
growing  discontent  and  feeling  of  isolation  among  so 
many  of  them. 

The  Missionary  and  South  Africa. — But  the 
missionary  movement  has  brought  some  great  and 
good  results.  It  has  attracted  attention  to  South 
Africa,  so  that  to-day  this  of  all  the  provinces  of 
the  British  Empire  receives  the  greatest  notice.  It 
brought  about  the  discovery  of  the  present  trade  route 
to  the  Zambesi,  through  British  Bechuanaland  and 
the  Bechuanaland  Protectorate.  It  began  the  move- 
ment by  which  the  history  of  Cape  Colony  widened 
into  that  of  South  Africa;  until  eventually,  David 
Livingstone  passed  on  into  Central  Africa,  and  linked 
the  story  of  the  southern  peninsula  to  the  record  of 
an  opening  continent.      To  use  a  well-known  term, 


I02  AFRICA    VTA/TING 

the  expansion  of  the  Cape  Colony  and  the  expansion 
of  South  Africa  were  in  great  measure  the  work  of 
missionaries. 

Further,  missionaries  taught  white  and  black  men 
to  live  together,  the  importance  of  which  can  only- 
no  w  be  clearly  seen.  Their  views  and  their  dealings 
may  have  been  in  some  cases  premature,  but  they 
were  at  least  the  views  and  the  dealings  of  the  coming 
time.  Once  more,  missionary  enterprise  ennobled 
South  African  history.  Men  to  be  revered  have  won 
their  fame  in  Africa  and  by  Africa.  The  record  of  a 
man  like  Moffat  will  never  be  forgotten,  and  schoolboys 
turn  from  old  world  romance  to  the  heroism  of  later 
days,  and  dream  to  mould  their  lives  on  that  of 
Livingstone. 

A  Summary  of  South  African  Missions. 

The  Moravians  were  again  the  first  to  enter 
South  Africa,  and  the  six  years  spent  by  George 
Schmidt  single-handed,  from  1737-44,  form  an  undying 
example  of  industry  to  every  future  missionary.  He 
was  determined  to  raise  the  Hottentot  to  the  same 
level  as  the  European,  even  though  it  meant  life-long 
banishment  from  Africa  and  his  Hottentot  flock  of 
forty-seven.  Thus  he  returned  to  Germany  to  earn 
his  living  as  a  sexton  at  Herrnhut,  until  his  noble 
death  with  a  prayer  for  Africans  upon  his  lips. 

No  wonder  we  find  his  successors  permitted  to 
return  to  where  he  had  laboured,  and  still  was  un- 
forgotten  fifty  years  after.  At  last  they  gathered 
around  them  the  largest  settlement  outside  Cape 
Town,  and  re-christened  this  *' glen  of  apes,"  as  the 
"valley  of  grace  "  or  Gnade^ithal.  But  this  was  only 
the  beginning,  for  the  news  of  this  Christian  settlement 
spread  across  the  Zak  river  (600  miles  away)  and  led 
to  all  future  Missions  in  South-West  Africa.  Again, 
eastern  stations  were  planted  later  among  the  Kaffirs, 
and  Shiloh,  which  was  founded  in  1828,  grew  to  be  the 
mother  church  in  the  east,  just  as  Gnadenthal  was  in 


SOUTH  AFRICA    AND   BRITISH   CENTRAL    AFRICA      I03 

the  west.  So  that  now  we  find  nineteen  stations 
instead  of  one,  among  Bushmen,  Kaffirs,  and  Hotten- 
tots, with  the  work  spreading  even  as  far  as  the  N.W. 
of  Lake  Nyasa  {vide  ch.  v.). 

The  second  to  enter  South  Africa  was  The  London 
Missionary  Society.  Above  all  others  this  Mission 
in  South  Africa  is  famous  for  great  men,  and  notable 
converts.  Its  very  first  leader  was  a  genius.  Dr. 
Vanderhemjg,  at  first  a  sceptic  and  a  cavalry  officer, 
then  an  accomplished  scholar  at  Leyden  and  medical 
at  Edinburgh,  acquired  sixteen  languages  between  his 
conversion  and  his  call  to  go  abroad.  He  was  also  the 
means  of  starting  two  Dutch  Missionary  Societies 
before  leaving  Holland.  His  first  attempt  to  start  a 
Kaffir  Mission  (1799-1800)  proving  a  failure,  he  fell 
back  to  work  among  the  Hottentots  at  Graaf  Eeinet, 
till  he  was  given  Bethelsdorp  as  a  station  by  the 
Government. 

Not  less  remarkable  were  John  Campbell  as  con- 
solidator  and  Dr.  Phillips  as  administrator  of  L.M.S. 
Missions.  It  was  the  latter  who  stirred  up  French 
Protestants  to  start  the  Basuto  Mission.  He  also 
guided  the  Ehenish  and  Berhn  missionaries  as  to 
the  best  centres  in  which  to  establish  their  missions. 

At  the  same  time  Bohert  Moffat  was  coming  into 
notice.  Whether  teaching  the  recently  converted 
Africaner,  who  had  once  been  a  famous  border 
robber  and  outlaw,  or  taming  the  tribes  beyond 
the  Orange  Eiver;  or  translating  the  Bible  into 
Sechuana,  founding  the  Kuruman  institution  for 
native  teachers,  and  thrice  visiting  Moselikatse  (the 
father  of  Lobengula),  the  Matabele  king — this  man's 
life  of  fifty  years'  missionary  service  is  one  long  study. 
His  story  thrills  the  boys  of  every  generation,  and 
beckons  them  to  Africa. 

But  David  Livingstone  was  the  greatest  of  them 
aU.  No  one  can  properly  understand  how  Central 
Africa  has  been  opened  within  the  last  fifty  years, 
without  first  gaining  an  insight  into  his  life.  He 
was   "  the  incomparable    missionary    traveller,  with 


I04  AFRICA    WAITING 

amazing  energy  and  patience,  indomitable  com^age  and 
great  observational  powers;  whose  method  of  travel 
is  so  superior  to  any  other — by  seeking  to  conciliate 
and  win  the  poor,  ignorant,  wretched  savage  to  the 
cause  of  civilization  and  Christianity."  Of  many  hfe- 
iike  pictures.  Dr.  Blaikie's — "  Personal  Life  of  Living- 
stone " — is  the  best,  while  for  a  fuller  study,  his 
"  Missionary  Travels  in  South  Africa  "  are  a  mine  of 
information  and  illustration.  He  must  be  studied  in 
every  phase  of  life  ;  as  the  plodding  South  African 
missionary  (1840-9)  ;  as  the  champion  of  native  races  ; 
as  one  divinely  guided  to  become  a  missionary  explorer ; 
as  the  pioneer  of  travel,  science,  and  commerce 
in  Central  Africa ;  as  the  awakener  of  Christendom 
to  the  horrors  of  the  Arab  slave-trade ;  and  last  of 
all  as  the  instrument  used  to  turn  all  eyes  on  Central 
Africa,  for  its  speedy  evangelization  and  development. 

Among  many  native  triumphs  of  the  Gospel, 
perhaps  Africaner,  SechSle  and  Khama  are  the  most 
well-known.  Africaner  has  already  been  mentioned 
in  connexion  with  Moffat.  Sech^le  owed  his  conver- 
sion to  Livingstone.  Khama  embraced  Christian 
teaching  from  the  very  first.  All  should  be  acquainted 
with  what  took  place,  when  Khama  became  paramount 
chief  of  the  Bamangwato  (1872)  ;  how  he  pubHcly 
disavowed  heathen  usages  and  superstitions,  and 
proclaimed  his  beHef  in  the  Word  of  God.  Quite 
recently  he  removed  his  capital  to  Palapye,  because 
water  was  scarce  in  Shoshong,  and  built  there  a 
Christian  church  that  cost  £3000.  But  more  wonderful 
still  have  been  his  latest  achievements,  namely,  the 
consolidation  of  the  wandering  Bakalaharis  into  a 
happy  pastoral  people,  and  the  resolute  protection  of 
his  people  from  the  drink. 

The  L.M.S.  holds  a  high  place,  indeed,  among 
South  African  Missions.  This  is  due,  first  of  all,  to  the 
fact  that  it  is  a  pioneer  agency.  It  prepared  the  way 
for  the  Ehenish  Mission  in  Namaqualand,  and  the  Ber- 
lin Mission  among  the  Korannas.  It  generously 
bequeathed  the  field  of  Basutoland  to  the  French  and 


SOUTH  AFRICA    AND   BRITISH   CENTRAL   AFRICA      1 05 

Kaffraria  to  the  Scotch.  Elsewhere  it  was  the  first  to 
reach  the  Bushmen,  Griquas,  Bechuanas,  and  Makololo. 
Secondly,  as  a  mission,  it  pursues  an  evmigelis  tic  policy, 
and  afterwards  gives  freedom  and  independence  to  its 
Native  Churches.  Thus  the  call  to  self-support  and 
extension  (1867-8)  soon  led  to  the  establishment  of  a 
Congregational  Union  for  South  Africa  (1888),  to 
which  the  census  of  1891  assigned  70,000  members. 

The  first  English  Wesleyan  Methodist  missionary 
set  foot  in  South  Africa  in  1814.  The  Wesleyan 
doctrine  was  then  in  bad  repute  in  Cape  Town,  so 
Barnabas  Shaw,  the  pioneer,  made  his  way  north- 
wards, seeking  guidance  from  above  as  to  where  to  go. 
After  300  miles  journey  he  met  a  Hottentot  chief  who 
had  travelled  200  miles  in  search  of  white  men  to  teach 
his  people.  Together,  therefore,  they  settled  in  Little 
Namaqualand.  Then  the  work  spread  to  the  Orlams, 
Bastards  and  Griquas  in  the  west.  In  1820  Cape  Town 
and  Grahamstown  were  occupied,  but  it  has  been  in 
the  eastern  half  of  the  colony  that  Methodism  has 
most  progressed.  Ever  since  1820  it  has  settled 
British  emigrants  in  the  eastern  districts.  Originally 
these  colonies  were  meant  to  act  as  peaceful  outposts  to 
Kaffir  aggression,  but  they  have  also  brought  about  the 
extension  of  Christianity,  until  now  the  whole  east  of 
the  colony  owes  much  of  its  importance  religiously, 
materially  and  morally  to  Methodism. 

In  1882  Methodism  was  found  to  be  so  widespread 
that  a  South  African  Conference  was  formed,  and  all 
the  stations  and  societies  south  of  the  Vaal  Eiver  were 
committed  to  its  care.  To  the  north  of  the  Vaal 
recent  extension  has  been  rapid,  so  that  the  English 
Society  now  works  in  the  Transvaal,  Swaziland,  Zulu- 
land,  Stellaland,  and  British  Bechuanaland.  As 
recently  as  1891  the  Society  was  ofi'ered  assistance  by 
the  British  South  African  Company  in  starting  work 
in  Mashonaland  and  Ehodesia,  where  seven  stations 
have  since  been  formed  under  the  guidance  of  Mr. 
Isaac  Shimmin. 

The  Anglican  Church   in   South   Africa. — In 


I06  AFRICA    WAITING 

early  times  occasional  Church  of  England  chaplains 
were  found  in  Cape  Town,  Henry  Martyn  amongst  them. 
But  not  till  the  Colonization  movement  of  1819-20  was 
the  Society  for  the  Propagation  of  the  Gospel  connected 
with  South  Africa.  In  1832  Bishop  Wilson,  on  his 
way  to  Calcutta,  held  the  first  Anglican  ordination, 
but  until  the  year  1846  the  Enghsh  Church  neglected 
these  her  colonists.  At  last  in  1847  Dr.  Gray  was  con- 
secrated Bishop  of  Cape  Town.  His  diocese  was  twice 
the  size  of  the  British  Isles,  and  took. a  whole  year  to 
visit.  He  had  to  travel  900  miles  before  he  found  one 
English  church  ;  there  were  only  fourteen  clergymen 
and  eleven  churches  altogether.  More  than  once  he 
officiated  at  Holy  Communion  in  a  Dutch  chapel,  and 
in  his  closing  letters  he  spoke  most  highly  of  the 
Moravians,  the  Methodists  and  the  Dutch  Church. 
*'  If  the  restoration  of  unity,"  he  said,  ''  be  the  condi- 
tion of  the  conversion  of  the  world,  every  sacrifice  but 
that  of  truth  must  be  made  to  attain  it." 

So  great  was  the  change  wrought  during  the  twenty- 
five  years  of  his  episcopate,  that  by  the  year  of  his 
death  (1872),  ''  A  vast  Ecclesiastical  Province  had  been 
created,  containing  five  dioceses  complete  with  Syno- 
dical,  Parochial  and  Missionary  organizations,  ad- 
ministered by  127  clergymen,  besides  lay  teachers." 
This  venerable  Society  carries  on  large  operations 
among  the  natives  in  the  east  of  Cape  Colony  (around 
Grahamstown  and  in  Kaffraria).  Also  in  Natal,  Zulu- 
land,  Basutoland,  Bechuanaland,  Griqualand  West, 
Orange  Free  State,  the  Transvaal,  Swaziland,  and 
Mashonaland.  It  has  over  100  stations  and  16,000 
communicants. 

Like  the  Methodists,  "its  colonial  ministry  is  also 
missionary,"  and  some  of  "  its  missionaries  are  also 
colonial  ministers."  The  result  has  been  that  many 
"  European  members  take  a  deep  interest  in  Missions 
to  the  heathen."  These  African  Churches  are  becom- 
ing more  and  more  missionary  in  their  spirit  and 
action,  while  colonially  they  hold  a  position  of  the 
highest  importance. 


SOUTH   AFRICA    AND   BRITISH   CENTRAL   AFRICA      lO? 

On  the  other  hand,  the  course  pursued  by  L.M.S., 
Presbyterian,  American  and  other  European  societies 
has  undoubtedly  produced  greater  missionary  results  ; 
while  it  is  to  be  regretted  that,  in  so  wide  a  field, 
greater  consideration  was  not  always  from  the  first 
given  to  societies  already  in  occupation. 

Presbyterians  in  South  Africa. — The  Dutch 
Church  of  South  Africa  is  as  old  as  the  colony  itself, 
besides  being  the  largest  and  most  influential,  "  From 
the  Church  of  Holland,"  writes  Dr.  Andrew  Murray, 
**  it  has  its  general  framework,  with  its  Confession  and 
Liturgies,  and  its  forms  of  service.  ...  To  the  Church 
of  France  it  owes  much  of  its  best  spiritual  life.  The 
influence  of  Scotland  may  be  traced  in  its  theology,  its 
view  of  the  relation  to  the  State,  its  pastoral  work,  as 
well  as  its  religious  life  as  seen  in  Sabbath  observance, 
prayer  meetings  and  missions." 

In  1862  it  commenced  its  battle  with  Liberalism 
introduced  from  Holland.  In  1875  a  Bill  in  the  Cape 
Parliament  made  an  end  of  State  support,  so  that  the 
Dutch  Church  is  now  disestablished,  and  there  are 
now  three  Dutch  Churches  in  South  Africa— the 
Dutch  Beformed  Church  of  the  Cape,  the  Beformed  Free 
Church  (or  Church  of  the  Doppers),  and  the  Beformed 
Church  of  the  South  African  Bepicblic.  The  first  has 
eleven  Missions  and  stations  among  the  natives  of 
South  Africa,  and  the  South  African  Dutch  Missionary 
Society  shows  increasing  signs  of  life. 

It  seems  quite  possible  that  a  Federation  of  Dutch 
and  Anglo-Saxon  Evangehcal  Churches  will  soon  be 
made.  "  The  Presbyterian  Church  of  South  Africa 
should  one  day  include  them  all,  and  become  more  and 
more  than  hitherto  a  living  Missionary  Church."  ^ 

The  seat  of  Scotch  Presbyterian  Missions  is  in 
Kaffraria.  The  Glasgow  Missionary  Society  entered 
in  1821  (a  Scottish  Society  based  on  principles  similar 
to  the  L.M.S.).  In  1844,  due  to  divisions  in  the 
Church  at  home,  the  work  was  separated  into  United 
Presbyterian  and  Free  Church.  This  has  led  to  good 
results     and    increased    resources.      These    Scottish 


108  AFRICA    WAITING 

Missions  have  aimed  at  a  very  high  ideal  in  their 
plantation  of  Native  Churches,  so  that  they  have 
developed  an  excellent  native  ministry.  The  U.P. 
Church  works  exclusively  among  the  Kaffirs,  that  is, 
among  the  Galekas,  Gaikas,  and  Fingoes.  Their  first 
Native  minister  was  the  Eev.  Tyo  Soga,  who  had  great 
influence  among  the  Native  chiefs. 

Lovedale  (South  Kaffraria)  is  the  great  educational 
institution  of  the  Free  Church,  and  holds  an  unique 
position  in  the  Colony.  It  is  an  attempt  in  South 
Africa  to  follow  an  adapted  form  of  Duff's  Mission 
system.  Brought  into  existence  by  Mr.  Govan,  and 
inspired  by  a  personal  visit  from  Dr.  Duff,  it  has  of 
late  years  been  very  ably  developed  by  Dr.  Stewart. 
It  has  an  industrial  character,  for  it  trains  and  educates 
blacksmiths,  carpenters,  waggon-makers,  printers,  book- 
binders, telegraphists,  and  even  farmers.  It  is  for 
this  reason  that  the  Government  gives  it  an  annual 
grant-in-aid  of  £2000.  ''  Nothing  but  Dr.  Stewart's 
knowledge  of  farming  and  unusual  capacity  for  super- 
intendence could  keep  it  going." 

During  1895  its  membership  increased  to  457,  and 
the  number  of  candidates  to  127. 

Blythswood  (North  Kaffraria)  has  sprung  out  of 
Lovedale  at  the  request  of  the  Fingoes,  and  is  affiliated 
to  it.  It  is  largely  supported  by  the  Fingoes  them- 
selves, a  tribe  but  recently  sunk  in  degradation  and 
slavery.  Sunday  after  Sunday  its  Boys'  Missionary 
Society  meets  for  prayer,  and  sends  out  ten  or  twelve 
of  its  members  to  preach  the  Gospel  to  the  surrounding 
kraals.  The  recent  prosperity  of  the  Fingoes  is  already 
leading  to  an  overcrowding  of  population.  This  is  a 
grave  problem  which  calls  for  a  speedy  solution. 

Another  result  of  Duff's  visit  to  South  Africa  has 
been  the  Free  Church  Zulu  Mission  (1867).  It  has 
three  centres — Maritzburg,  Impolweni,  and  Umsinga 
(Gordon  Memorial  Mission).  There  is  a  band  of 
thirty  unpaid  local  preachers,  to  whom  the  entire 
success  of  the  work  in  the  country  is  due. 

The  French  Huguenots  are  represented  by  the 


SOUTH  AFRICA   AND   BRITISH  CENTRAL  AFRICA       1 09 

French   Evangelical    Basuto    Mission. — It   is 

one  of  the  most  concentrated  and  successful  Missions  in 
South  Africa,  and  Christianity  is  now  the  predominating 
influence  in  the  country.  How  this  has  all  come  about 
since  1829  is  worth  reading.  The  story  of  the  intel- 
ligent Basuto  Chief,  Moshesh,  with  *'his  humanity,  his 
mildness,  his  love  of  peace  and  justice,  his  horror  of 
war  " — is  splendid.  He  only  became  a  Christian  three 
months  before  he  died,  saying  on  his  deathbed, 
**  I  have  only  just  been  born."  This  Mission  is  con- 
spicuous for  its  high  standard  of  missionaries.  Men 
like  Casalis,  Prochet,  Dyke,  and  Eolland  would  be  an 
ornament  to  any  Christian  Church.  They  have 
introduced  some  excellent  Normal  and  Training  Insti- 
tutes for  girls  and  boys. 

The  name  of  Aser  must  never  be  forgotten, — a  Native 
Christian,  who  pioneered  the  way  to  the  Zambesi  for 
his  countrymen,  and  set  a  bright  example  to  other 
Missions  in  South  Africa.  With  an  ardent  love  for 
souls,  he  made  his  way  through  the  Transvaal,  and 
across  the  Limpopo  to  the  Banyai  tribe  on  the  southern 
banks  of  the  Zambesi.  Having  made  friends  with  them, 
he  returned,  and  appealed  to  his  countrymen  to  come 
forward  to  evangelize  this  region.  Disasters  befell  the 
first  two  parties  on  the  way,  for  the  Banyai  proved 
treacherous,  and  the  Matabele  were  suspicious.  But 
in  1884  the  French  Mission  found  its  way  at  last  to 
the  river  Zambesi,  and  the  Barotse  country.  Here, 
after  ten  years  of  sowing,  a  great  ingathering  took 
place  (1895).  Pastor  Coillard  is  the  brave  leader  of 
this  Barotse  Mission,  and  of  all  the  missions  to  South 
Africa,  there  seem  to  be  none  that  come  nearer  to  a 
correct  ideal,  in  dealing  with  native  social  questions, 
than  these  French  Evangelical  Missionaries. 

One  more  Presbyterian  Mission,  though  late  in  the 
field,  must  be  mentioned  here.  The  Swiss  Free  Church 
Mission  came  into  existence  in  1875,  as  a  result  of 
offers  for  foreign  service  from  MM.  Creux  and 
Berthoud  during  their  theological  course.  Their  chief 
station  is  called  Valdezia,  and  they  also  work   on  the 


no  AFRICA    WAITING 

eastern  coast  near  Laurenzo  Marquez.  Since  the  year 
1883  the  Free  Churches  of  Neuchatel  and  Geneva  have 
joined  in  a  federation  w^ith  that  of  the  Canton  de  Vaud 
for  the  direction  of  the  Mission. 

German  Missions  in  South  Africa.— After  the 
Moravians,  the  Ehenish,  Berlin  and  Hermannsburg 
Missions  entered  South  Africa  in  1829, 1834,  and  1854. 
A  few  special  features  of  German  mission  v^ork  should 
be  noted. 

'*  First,  German  missionaries  follow  Evangelistic  lines. 
They  have  a  very  clear  and  decided  idea  of  missionary 
work  as  being  purely  and  solely  religious,  in  other 
words  to  preach  the  gospel  for  the  salvation  of  souls. 
They  always  devote  their  powers  therefore  to  purely 
Evangelistic  effort.  This  gives  to  German  Mission 
work  an  appearance  of  simpleness,  as  compared  with 
English  Missions.  Consequently  the  gospel  is  abun- 
dantly preached,  and  every  young  missionary  is  com- 
pelled to  master  the  native  tongue  almost  as  well  as 
his  ovm  language  ;  in  fact,  no  missionary  is  officially 
recognized,  and  ordained,  before  proving  that  he  has  a 
thorough  knowledge  of  the  language.  Secondly,  Cate- 
chumens are  instructed  in  the  rudiments  of  Christian 
truth  as  thoroughly  as  possible,  with  the  object  of 
training  up  a  Native  Christian  community.  Thirdly, 
they  are  very  careful  about  Church  discipline  ;  they 
see  in  the  Native  convert  only  a  new-born  child  in  the 
faith,  who  needs  perpetual  education  in  order  to 
become  a  full  man  in  Christ.  Perhaps  the  difference 
between  German  and  other  Mission  work  is  nowhere 
more  striking  than  in  this  unwearied  and  patient 
education  of  their  flock.  Fourthly,  they  spend  much 
time  and  energy  in  translating  Holy  Scripture  and 
other  religious  literature,  so  that  even  such  an  intricate 
and  difficult  language  as  that  of  the  Hottentots  has 
been  mastered.  It  is  significant  that  the  final  revision 
of  the  Kaffir  and  Sesuto  Bible  was  laid  in  the  hands 
of  German  missionaries.  Fifthly,  they  give  compara- 
tively little  attention  to  those  spheres  of  missionary 
labour,  which  in  their  opinion  are  only  subordinate  to 
the  main  Evangelistic  work.     Women's  work  in  Africa 


SOUTH  AFRICA    AND   BRITISH   CENTRAL    AFRICA      III 

is  only  just  becoming  recognized  ;  Medical  Missions 
are  only  established  in  unhealthy  climates,  and 
specially  for  the  sake  of  the  missionaries  themselves. 
But  every  young  missionary  goes  through  some  medical 
training  before  going  out,  somewhat  on  the  lines  of 
Livingstone  College  in  London.  Sixthly,  Industrial 
Missions  are  never  undertaken  as  a  separate  missionary 
agency,  but  only  when  they  can  be  of  help  to  the 
spiritual  work.  The  Moravians  win  a  great  deal  of 
their  income  from  their  shops  in  the  mission  stations. 
The  Ehenish  Mission  has  spent  a  good  deal  of 
money  and  energy  in  introducing  useful  handicrafts  in 
its  South  African  Mission,  Dr.  Hugo  Hahn  being 
famous  for  his  industrial  ability;  while  the  Berlin 
mission  station  of  Botchabelo  (near  Middleburg)  in 
South  Transvaal  is  one  of  the  finest  specimens  of 
industrial  stations.  Last  of  all,  in  the  use  of  Native 
agents,  German  Missions  are  slow  to  make  Native 
Christians  independent,  either  as  Native  pastors  or 
as  superintendents.  Instead  of  the  independent  theory 
of  self-government,  Native  agents  work  under  close 
European  supervision,  and  this  with  excellent  results." 

German  South- West  Africa  contains  three  great 
mission-fields,  the  Bhenish  Mission  to  Bastards  in 
Great  Nama  Land,  and  to  Hereros  in  Damara 
Land,  and  the  Bhenish  and  Finnish  Missions  in 
Ovambo  Land.  From  the  Orange  Eiver  in  the  south 
to  the  Cun^ne  in  the  north,  the  whole  length  and 
breadth  of  the  land  is  covered  with  a  network  of  stations 
and  out-stations,  perhaps  the  most  perfect  specimen  of 
systematic  missionary  work  in  the  whole  of  Africa. 
The  Wesleyan  and  London  missionaries  opened  the 
way  in  these  large  and  desolate  tracts  ;  and  since  1840 
the  Ehenish  missionaries  have  worked  with  indefatig- 
able zeal.  The  whole  south  of  the  sparsely  populated 
Great  Nama  Land  is  in  course  of  Christianiza- 
tion.  In  one  or  two  decades  no  heathen  will  be  found 
there. 

The  Berlin  Mission  is  widely  extended  in  South 
Africa,  and  its  stations  form  a  right  wing  from  south 
to  north,  to  which  the  Ehenish  and  L.M.S.  form  the 


112  AFRICA    WAITING 

left  and  centre.  At  the  same  time  the  concentration  of 
the  work  is  seen  by  the  fact  that  it  has  organized  six 
synods  for  Transvaal  North  and  South,  Natal,  Kaffraria, 
Orange  Free  State,  and  Cape  Colony.  Its  stations  in 
Cape  Colony  are  now  really  '^  parishes  of  black  baptized 
people."  Its  latest  Mission  in  the  Transvaal,  founded 
under  the  able  leadership  of  Messrs.  Merensky  and 
Griitzner,  has  become  the  most  flourishing,  and  the 
story  of  the  persecution  of  the  Native  Christians  by 
Sekukuni  (1864),  and  of  the  foundation  of  Botchabelo, 
is  one  of  the  most  romantic  episodes  of  South  African 
Missionary  History. 

The  Hermannsburg  Mission. — For  the  unique  story 
of  Pastor  Harms  and  his  village  work  at  Hermanns- 
burg, the  reader  is  referred  to  the  late  Dr.  W.  Fleming 
Stevenson's  "  Praying  and  Working."  And  its  special 
features  and  methods  are  worth  a  careful  study.  The 
Mission  which  he  brought  into  being  by  his  faith- 
fulness, with  its  Lutheran  doctrine,  and  its  deep 
spirituality,  has  done  much  to  revive  German  Chris- 
tianity. Its  first  mission- band  was  gathered  from 
among  the  farmers  and  handicraftsmen  in  the  neigh- 
bourhood of  Hermannsburg,  where  a  great  spiritual 
awakening  had  taken  place.  They  were  specially 
trained  in  their  own  mission-house  by  a  brother  of 
Harms,  the  course  of  instruction  extending  over  four 
years,  and  a  great  range  of  subjects. 

Their  first  desire  was  to  start  a  Mission  to  the 
Gallas.  In  this  they  were  foiled  on  arrival  at  Zanzibar, 
by  the  Sultan  (1854).  The  ship  Candace,  specially 
built  for  the  outgoing  missionaries,  returned  therefore 
to  Natal,  where  a  basis  of  operations  was  made  with 
a  view  to  entering  Zululand  later  on.  They  founded 
a  "  Home  for  all  the  Missionaries  and  Colonists  where 
they  should  live  in  common,"  and  called  it  New 
Hermannsburg.  Here  they  began  educational  and 
industrial  missionary  work,  and  a  Christian  Colonial 
Boarding  School.  Soon  after  Zululand  was  opened 
by  gaining  favour  with  Panda,  the  father  of  Cetywayo, 
by  making  hiip  a  Urge  waggon-house.     Within   five 


SOUTH  AFRICA    AND   BRITISH   CENTRAL    AFRICA      I13 

years  100  German  labourers  were  in  the  field,  but  a 
separation  soon  took  place  between  the  Colonists  and 
the  Missionaries. 

Later  on,  the  Boers  invited  the  Hermannsburg 
missionaries  to  Bechuanaland  and  the  Transvaal.  In 
the  latter  they  have  been  much  blessed,  especially  at 
Bethanie. 

Scandinavian  Missions  in  South  Africa. — The 
Norwegian  Mission,  founded  in  1842  on  an  Evangelical 
basis,  has  its  training  college  and  headquarters  at 
Stavanger.  Its  most  interesting  character  is  Schreuder, 
who  pioneered  the  way  for  the  Mission  into  Zululand, 
by  curing  King  Panda  with  his  medicine.  He  started 
the  station  of  Umpomulo  just  to  the  south  of  the 
Tugela  Eiver,  till  in  1890  there  were  nine  Norwegian 
stations  in  Zululand  and  three  in  Natal.  Schreuder, 
after  he  was  made  Bishop,  seceded  from  the  society, 
having  developed  High  Lutheran  views.  His  work 
is  called  Schreuder's  Mission.  In  1889  the  Nor- 
wegian Free  East  African  Mission  began  a  station  on 
the  Tugela  Eiver. 

The  Swedish  State  Church  Mission  has  three  sta- 
tions in  Natal.  The  principal  feature  of  the  work  has 
been  the  establishment  of  homes  for  Native  children. 

The  Finland  Missionary  Society,  of  Helsingfors, 
is  working  in  the  little  known  region  of  Ovamboland. 
The  country  is  full  of  corn  and  gardens,  which  are 
cultivated  by  the  Ovambo,  a  Bantu  race,  which  is 
supposed  to  have  migrated  there  from  the  Zambesi. 
Hahn,  the  Ehenish  missionary,  twice  visited  the  land 
(1857  and  1866).  But  being  unable  permanently  to 
occupy  it,  he  invited  thither  the  Finns.  They  arrived 
in  1870,  but  only  on  Epiphany  day  (1883)  had  they 
the  privilege  of  baptizing  the  first  converts.  Since 
then  the  Native  community  has  grown  very  slowly, 
for  Mission  work  is  seriously  hindered,  both  by  the 
pernicious  fevers  that  lurk  in  the  swampy  plains  and 
the  unceasing  tribal  wars  of  the  twelve  Ovambo  tribes  ; 
in  1892  the  Ehenish  Mission  followed  its  Finnish 
brethren  into  this  remote  country.

114  AFRICA    WATTING 

The    American    Board   of  Foreign    Missions 

works  in  Natal,  and  is  valued  alike  by  Government, 
Colonists,  and  Natives.  The  six  missionaries  who 
reached  the  Cape  in  1835,  after  many  vicissitudes, 
settled  in  Natal  (1836).  For  ten  long  years  there  were 
no  converts,  but  only  trouble  after  trouble  between 
Zulu  and  Boer.  Dr.  Adams  and  Mr.  Lindley  rank 
among  the  very  first  South  African  missionaries.  The 
Mission  has  a  great  number  of  Native  pastors,  preachers 
and  catechists,  besides  a  normal  seminary,  a  female 
boarding-school,  and  an  excellent  system  of  "kraal 
visiting,"  which  is  akin  to  Zanana  work.  To  them  is 
due  the  translation  of  the  Zulu  Bible.  In  1883  they 
extended  work  to  Inhambane,  a  port  to  the  north  of 
the  Eiver  Limpopo,  and  from  1880-4  they  succeeded 
in  establishing  a  fruitful  mission  in  the  highlands  of 
Bailundu  and  Bihe  in  Central  Africa. 

The  South  African  General  Mission  was  formed 
in  1894  by  the  amalgamation  of  the  Cape  General 
Mission  and  South-East  Africa  Evangelistic  Mission. 
It  has  a  threefold  aim — to  evangelize  the  heathen,  to 
rouse  the  Christian  Church  to  a  holier  life,  and  to  aid 
existing  Evangelical  Missions  and  Churches.  The 
scope  of  its  work  has  rapidly  spread  among  Europeans, 
Natives  and  Jews  in  South  Africa,  until  it  has 
stations  in  almost  every  state  in  South-East  Africa. 
It  has  now  about  eighty  workers,  fourteen  of  whom 
work  in  connexion  with  the  Cape  Town  "  Nurses' 
Home,"  and  sixteen  in  Johannesburg,  which  for  many 
reasons  is  one  of  the  most  difficult  fields  in  South 
Africa  for  Christian  work.  The  publications  of  the 
Mission  are  exceptionally  attractive  and  up  to  date, 
while  persistently  emphasizing  the  spiritual  side  of 
mission  work. 


The  Work  of  David  Livingstone. 

The  above   short  review  of  Protestant  Missionary 
Enterprise  in  South  Africa  has  led  us  to  see  nation 


SOUTH  AFRICA    AND   BRITISH   CENTRAL    AFRICA      II5 

after  nation  entering  the  field.  We  have  seen  the 
sphere  of  missionary  operation  extending  from  the 
Cape  to  the  Cunene  on  the  west,  and  the  Zambesi  on 
the  east.  Moreover,  before  this  chapter  closes  we  shall 
see  how  British  influence  has  extended  even  beyond  the 
Zambesi,  till  it  includes  the  highlands  of  Nyasa  and 
Shire  and  reaches  the  southern  shores  of  Tanganyika. 

David  Livingstone  was  the  great  cause  of  this 
development.  If  the  Boers  were  bent  on  closing  the 
interior  to  Europeans,  Livingstone  was  equally  deter- 
mined to  open  it.  He  saw  that  the  true  plan  for 
Africa's  evangelization  must  be  broad  enough  to  take 
in  the  whole  continent  and  its  whole  future. 

Looked  at  from  our  present  standpoint  it  is  im- 
possible to  separate  David  Livingstone's  first  great 
journey  across  Africa,  extending  from  June  1852  to 
August  1856,  from  his  previous  'twelve  years  of  mis- 
sionary labours  and  travels  in  Bechuanaland.  For  it 
was  at  Chonuane  that  he  met  the  chief  Sechele,  who 
later  on  helped  him  to  cross  the  Kalahari  desert,  to 
discover  Lake  Ngami  (1849),  and  to  visit  Sebituane, 
King  of  the  Makololo  (1851).  It  was,  however,  Living- 
stone's trans-continental  journey  that  established  his 
reputation  as  an  explorer. 

His  second  great  expedition  (1858-64)  was  under- 
taken in  the  service  of  the  British  Government  and 
confined  to  the  Zambesi  waterway  and  the  Nyasa 
highlands.  It  has  since  been  fruitful  both  in  colonial 
expansion  and  in  the  establishing  of  missionary  settle- 
ments in  those  regions.  But  at  the  time  this  second 
journey  did  not  attract  much  attention,  dissensions 
among  the  European  members  of  the  expedition  rather 
tending  to  detract  from  the  glory  of  the  first  journey 
than  to  add  to  it. 

His  last  great  journeys  (1866-73)  have  undoubtedly 
been  fruitful  beyond  all  description  in  rousing,  not 
only  the  British  nation  but  the  whole  world  to  the 
real  state  of  the  African  Negro  ;  and  his  death  at  Ilala 
in  1873  was  the  last  note  of  the  bugle  call  that  rallied 
Europe  really  to  care  for  the  African.

Il6  AFRICA    WAITING 


South  African  Evangelization  in  Central  Africa. 

As  a  direct  result  of  Livingstone's  life  work  "  there 
are  now  five  Central  African  Missions  which  have 
their  basis  properly  in  South  African  evangelism." 
These  comprise  the  Free  Church  of  Scotland,  the 
L.M.S.,  the  French  Evangelical  Mission,  and  the 
Moravian  and  Berlin  missions  of  Germany. 

The  story  of  the  African's  part  in  opening  up  the 
continent  has  been  told  already  in  the  case  of  Sech^le 
and  Aser.  Eecent  extension  of  German  missions  into 
Konde-land  has  also  been  touched  on  in  ch.  v.  We 
are,  therefore,  now  concerned  with  efforts  of  the  Scotch 
Presbyterians  and  the  L.M.S.  to  occupy  the  Lake 
Eegions  of  Central  Africa. 

It  was  really  in  1861  that  the  movement  began, 
for  the  Eev.  (now  Dr.)  James  Stewart  offered  his 
services  to  commence  missions  '*  somewhere  in  those 
internal  territories  laid  open  by  Livingstone.  He 
actually  joined  Dr.  Livingstone  in  his  second  expedi- 
tion, and  penetrated  a  considerable  way  up  the 
Zambesi  and  Shire  rivers.  Dr.  Stewart  never  laid 
aside  the  hope  of  helping  to  establish  a  mission  in  or 
near  the  centre  of  Africa."  It  was  he  therefore  who 
strongly  recommended  Lake  Nyasa  as  a  mission-field, 
and  the  name  Livingstonia  to  be  given  to  the  mission. 

It  was  however  the  news  of  the  death  of  Livingstone, 
upon  his  knees  at  Ilala  (May  1st,  1873),  that  brought 
all  Scotland  to  unite  in  sending  out  to  the  heart  of 
Africa  that  philanthropic  expedition,  which  resulted  in 
the  Livingstonia  and  Blantyre  missionary  settlements. 
When  the  time  came  (1875),  Dr.  Stewart  was  too 
engrossed  in  his  work  at  Lovedale  himself  to  pioneer 
the  new  mission.  But  the  services  of  the  late  Edward 
D.  Young,  E.N.,  were  lent  by  H.M.  Admiralty,  as 
he  had  spent  two  years  with  Livingstone,  and  also 
commanded  the  **  Livingstone  Search  Expedition." 
The  other  chief  members  of  this  first  party  were 
Dr.  Laws,  the  present  leader  and  veteran  of  the 
mission,  and  the  late  Mr.  Henderson,  the  founder  of 


SOUTH   AFRICA    AND    BRITISH    CENTRAL    AFRICA      II7 

Blantyre.  The  next  year  (1876)  a  second  expeditioa 
brought,  among  others,  Dr.  Stewart  and  four  Native 
Christian  agents  trained  at  Lovedale.  The  original 
site  of  Cape  Maclear,  selected  by  E.  D.  Young,  was 
now  abandoned  in  favour  of  Bandawe,  about  the  middle 
of  the  western  shore  of  Lake  Nyasa.  We  may  date 
the  beginning  of  the  Livingstonia  Mission  from 
this  time.  *'  More  recently  the  Dutch  Eeformed 
Church  of  South  Africa,  co-operating  with  Livingstonia, 
have  occupied  much  of  south-west  Nyasaland,  taking 
over  Chikusi's  country,  and  Cape  Maclear.  This  has 
enabled  the  Free  Church  of  Scotland  to  push  away 
northward  along  the  Stevenson  Eoad  to  Mwenzo. 
There,  where  the  great  rivers  rise  that  feed  the  Congo 
and  the  Zambesi,  two  missionaries  are  seeking  to  reach 
the  dreaded  Awemba.  This  is  the  last  of  the  jQghting 
tribes  to  be  tamed  by  the  Christian  teacher  and  doctor, 
now  that  Drs.  Laws  and  Elmslie  and  the  lamented 
Dr.  Steele  have  led  those  once  wild  Zulus,  the  Ngoni, 
to  beat  their  assegais  into  ploughshares." 

"  After  twenty  years  the  permanent  centre  of  the 
Livingstonia  Mission  has  been  fixed  in  the  north-east 
of  Ehodesia.  The  time  of  pioneering  and  founding 
seems  over,  when  at  five  stations  there  are  Christian 
congregations ;  when  seven  languages  have  been 
reduced  to  writing,  and  the  Bible  and  a  pure  literature, 
well  illustrated,  are  printed  on  the  spot  by  the  converts ; 
when  forty  schools  train  8000  j^ouths  ;  when  almost 
every  convert  is  a  missionary  to  others  in  some  form 
or  other ;  when  the  industrial  arts  have  been  intro- 
duced, and  not  least,  the  art  of  heahng;  and  when 
slave-hunting  and  the  poison  ordeal  have  ceased  out  of 
the  land." 

Again,  it  is  just  twenty  years  since  the  steam-launch 
Ilala  was  built  the  second  time,  and  floated  on  Nyasa 
waters,  to  discover  Likoma  Island  and  the  Livingstone 
Mountains.  Now  all  along  the  western  shore  the 
Nyasa  inhabitants  are  children  of  civilization.  The 
gentler  natives  of  the  lowlands  who  were  then  un- 
accustomed to   do   more  than   four  days'  work  at  a; 


Il8  AFRICA    WAITING 

time,  will  now  undergo  a  five  years'  apprenticeship. 
From  Chinde  to  Karonga,  natives  who  have  been  taught 
in  the  schools  now  act  as  stores-men,  boat-captains, 
and  gang-leaders  under  the  seventy  Scottish  employes 
of  the  African  Lakes  Corporation.  Not  a  few  who 
were  savages  the  other  day,  are  now  cooks  and  domestic 
servants.  Ambulance  and  medical  assistants,  able  to 
administer  chloroform  and  nurse  surgical  patients, 
were,  a  few  years  ago,  either  on  the  war-path  with  the 
slave-raider,  or  the  victims  who  feared  his  approach. 
Still  more  recently  several  lads  have  been  trained 
in  telegraphy  awaiting  the  extension  of  the  telegraph 
wire  from  Blantyre  to  the  new  Livingstonia.  Nations, 
in  fact,  are  being  born  in  a  day  in  this  new  colony, 
which  owes  its  origin  and  its  development  to  those  two 
Scottish  expeditions  organized  in  1875  and  1876.  At 
the  same  time  the  whole  of  this  mission  only  costs 
£7000  a  year. 

Dr.  Laws  is  now  taking  steps  to  found  an  Institu- 
tion in  Nyasaland,  similar  to  Lovedale  and  Blyths- 
wood  in  South  Africa,  "  to  be  the  most  advanced  post  of 
civilization  from  the  south  towards  Uganda  and  Cairo, 
and  eventually  to  form  a  half-way  house  on  the  great 
African  central  rift  of  rivers  and  lakes." 

Two  or  three  days'  journey  to  the  South  of  Lake 
Nyasa  lies  the  mountainous  district,  now  known  as  the 
Shire  highlands.  It  was  here  in  a  splendid  and 
healthy  situation  that  Henderson  founded  the 
Blantyre  Mission  of  the  Church  of  Scotland.  The 
peoples  inhabiting  these  lands  are  partly  the  descend- 
ants of  Livingstone's  servants,  the  Makololo.  These 
by  their  determined  character  have  become  chiefs 
over  the  gentle  Manganja.  Some,  however,  of  the 
Wa-Yao  chiefs  still  maintain  their  independence.  The 
Ngoni  used  to  be  the  terror  of  their  neighbours,  and 
in  1884  a  Ngoni  raid  upon  the  Yao  was  only  just 
diverted  from  the  region  of  Blantyre  by  the  bravery  of 
Mr.  and  Mrs.  Scott,  who  journeyed  300  miles  in 
person  to  the  Ngoni  court  to  dissuade  the  king. 

Now  Blantyre   is    approached    by   an   avenue    of

eucalyptus  trees,  and  contains  one  of  the  most  hand- 
some churches  in  South   Africa,    all  built   by  native 
labour  within  three  years.     The  gardens  are  filled  with 
European  flowers  and  vegetables,   and  the  Yao  and 
Manganja  have    become  bricklayers   and  carpenters, 
while  the  Ngoni  serve  as  hewers  of  wood  and  drawers  of 
water.  They  have  thus  learnt  to  Hve  together  peaceably. 
Further,  the  Shire  highlands  boast  of  regular  publica- 
tions, such  as  the  Blantyre  Life  and  Work,  the  British 
Central  Africa  Gazette,  and  the  Central  African  Planter. 
The  Nyasa  News  was  issued  by  the  Universities'  Mis- 
sions till  Bishop  Maples'  death,  and  this  year  a  mis- 
sionary bi-monthly — The  Aurora — has  been  started  by 
the  Scotch  Free  Church.     Lastly,  the  time  for  adopting 
Nyanja  as  the  general  language  of  Nyasaland  seems 
to   be  approaching.     Dr.  Laws    has  approached  the 
different   Nyasa   missions  to  secure  a   representative 
Board  of  Translation.     The  desirability  of  having  a 
uniform  language  for  the   Holy  Scriptures,  and  other 
educational  text  books  is  obvious,  if  it  can  be  attained. 
The  Tanganyika  Mission  of  the  L.M.S.  was  the 
third   great   benefit   to   Central   Africa    derived   from 
Livingstone's  death.     It  was  the   magnanimous  offer 
of  Mr.  Arthington,  of  Leeds,  to  give   £5000    "  towards 
the    purchase   of    a   suitable  steamer   and  the  estab- 
Hshment  of  a  mission  on  the  shores  of  Lake  Tangan- 
yika," that  spurred  the  society  on  to  do  its  part  toward 
the  conquest  of  the   very  heart  of  Africa — for  Christ. 
But  few  missions   have   met   with   more   discourage- 
ments all  along,  for  in  less  than  ten  years  after  its 
commencement  ten  had  fallen  victims  to  the  climate. 
Among   these  was   the    honoured    secretary   of     the 
mission,  Dr.  Mullens.     The  hero  of  the  work  has  been 
Captain  Hore,  R.N.,  who   has  thoroughly  navigated 
this  inland  sea.     It  is  found  to  be  "  400  miles  long, 
and  from  fifteen  to  fifty  miles  broad,  having  a  coast- 
line of  1000  miles,   and  a  surface  of  13,000  square 
miles."    Graphic  descriptions  of  the  inhabitants  of  the 
lake,  of  the  scenery  of  the  country,  and  the  possibilities 
of  the  land  are  given  in  Captain  Hore's  "Tanganyika."

CHAPTER  VII. 

THE   SLAVE    TRADE   AND    THE   DRINK    TRAFEIO. 

Domestic  slavery,  of  a  mild  character,  is  com- 
mon all  over  Africa.  Every  country  and  every  race 
on  earth  have  at  some  stage  in  their  existence  groaned 
under  the  curse  of  slavery.  And  it  is  only  when  men 
have  recognized  the  dignity  of  manhood  and  the 
strength  of  freedom,  that  they  have  been  able  to  break 
their  fetters  and  stand  up  for  their  rights.  Though 
slavery  does  not  now  exist  in  Europe,  except  in  the 
Turkish  dominions,  nor  yet  in  the  New  World,  which 
has  abolished  it,  once  and  for  all,  it  is  still  prevalent 
in  many  advanced  Asiatic  states.  Africa  is  the  last 
continent,  as  a  continent,  where  it  exists. 

The  Slave  Trade. — Domestic  slavery,  however, 
is  lost  in  the  shadow  of  a  great  and  international 
wrong,  which  we  are  pledged  for  conscience'  sake 
to  remedy,  and  which  the  late  Professor  Henry 
Drummond  rightly  called  "the  heart  disease  of 
Africa."  Let  it  be  understood  that  there  have  been 
two  distinct  kinds  of  traffic  in  slaves,  the  Atlantic 
or  Colonial  Slave  Trade  of  the  West  Coast  and  the 
Arab  Slave  Trade  of  the  Sudan,  the  valleys  of  the 
Nile,  and  the  East  Coast  of  Africa. 

The  Atlantic  Slave  Trade. 
The  story  of  the  rise  and  growth  and  final  abolition 
of  this  inhuman  traffic  has  been  often  told.  Not- 
withstanding, we  doubt  whether  its  gigantic  evil  and 
sad  results  are  fully  realized.  A  thorough  under- 
standing of  its  history  is  as  essential  now  as  ever. 
We  purpose  therefore  speaking  of  its  character  in 
full  outline. 


122  AFRICA    WAITING 


1.  Cause  of  the  Trade. — The  fifteenth  century  wit- 
nessed the  final  break  up  of  the  old  Roman  Empire  in 
tho  East,  and  the  fuller  growth  of  states  in  Western 
Europe.  Of  these  young  states,  Professor  Freeman 
says  "  Portugal  led  the  way  to  conquest  and  coloniza- 
tion out  of  Europe.  She  had  a  geographical  and 
historical  call  so  to  do."  Modern  history  therefore 
dates  from  the  close  of  the  fifteenth  century — that 
age  of  discovery.  It  v^is  then  that  America  was  dis- 
covered by  Columbus  uie  Spaniard,  and  the  Cape  was 
rounded  by  Yr^sco  di  Gama  the  Portuguese.  Now 
for  the  first  time  the  peoples  of  Western  Europe 
came  face  to  face  with  multitudes  of  human  beings 
of  an  inferior  race.  On  the  one  hand  a  demand 
for  a  labour  supply  came  from  America,  a  supply  of 
Negroes  seemed  ready  to  hand  in  Africa  on  the 
other.  This  made  the  importation  of  the  strong 
black  race  to  the  New  World  an  absolute  necessity. 
For  the  well-developed  system  of  Indian  coolies  was 
then  unknown. 

2.  Beginnings  of  the  Trade. — As  far  back  as  1441 
a  few  slaves  had  been  imported  from  Africa  into 
Europe  and  given  as  first-fruits  to  the  Pope.  Before 
Prince  Henry  the  Navigator's  death  these  had  risen 
in  number  to  700  a  year.  It  is  clear,  however,  that  the 
guilt  and  shame  of  the  trade  rests  on  nations  rather 
than  on  rulers.  For  Pope  Leo  X.,  Charles  V.,  and 
Queen  Ehzabeth  are  all  said  to  have  declared  against 
the  traffic.  But  as  soon  as  America  was  discovered,  in 
1492,  the  trade  inevitably  increased.  *'  The  papal- 
decree,  which  divided  the  world  between  Spain  and 
Portugal,  closed  Africa  to  the  Spaniards,"  only  to  give 
the  Portuguese,  English,  French,  and  Dutch  slave- 
traders  a  two-fold  object — "  at  once  to  find  workmen 
for  their  fellow-countrymen  in  America  and  the  West 
Indies,  and  to  secure  the  gainful  monopoly  of  carrying 
slaves  to  the  dependencies  of  Spain." 

3.  Growth  of  the  Trade. — The  first  English  traders 
to  Africa  would  have  nothing  to  say  to  enslaving  the 
natives,  and  Sir  John  Hawkins  was  almost  a  solitary 


THE   SLAVE    TRADE   AND    THE   DRINK    TRAFFIC       1 23 

instance  of  an  English  slave-trader  for  many  long 
years.  Before  1600  the  Portuguese  had  the  monopoly, 
but  they  soon  had  their  power  broken  in  pieces  by  the 
Dutch.  It  was  a  Dutchman  that  introduced  the  art 
of  sugar-making  into  Barbadoes,  from  Brazil.  The 
sugar  plantations  absorbed  an  ever-growing  number  of 
Negro  slaves.  Hispaniola,  St.  Domingo,  and  Jamaica 
all  grew  in  wealth  and  power,  and  Kingston  harbour 
became  a  great  distributing  centre  of  the  slave  trade. 
By  1660  the  British  slave  trade  became  an  established 
fact,  and  chartered  companies  were  started,  while 
from  the  Peace  of  Utrecht,  in  1713,  England  received 
the  Assiento  contract  for  thirty  years.  So  quickly  did 
she  then  take  the  lead,  that  within  a  hundred  years 
over  two  million  negroes  had  been  imported  into  British 
Colonies — 610,000  to  Jamaica  alone.  The  total  number 
deported  to  the  New  World  in  the  eighteenth  century 
is  estimated  by  Mr.  Keltie  at  six  millions.  In  1830, 
twenty- three  years  after  the  final  act  of  abolition.  Sir 
Fowell  Buxton  estimated  that  150,000  slaves  were 
being  imported  into  the  New  World  every  year.  And 
it  is  a  sad  confession  to  make,  that  only  sixty  years 
ago  nearly  250,000  slaves  were  being  exported  every 
year  from  Africa  by  Christian  States  ! 

4.  Methods  of  ohtainiiig  Slaves. — Some  were  kid- 
napped by  a  party  in  ambush ;  others  were  purchased 
as  the  rightful  prisoners  or  criminals  of  a  tribe ;  and 
in  times  of  famine  slaves  would  sell  themselves  in 
order  to  be  fed ;  yet  again,  kings  and  individuals  would 
deliberately  capture  slaves  for  sale. 

5.  Horrors  by  the  Way. — At  least  one-third  of  those 
captured  died,  either  on  the  march,  on  in  the  barra- 
coons  waiting  for  the  slave  ships,  or  in  "the  middle 
passage."  Sometimes  700  would  be  stowed  away  on 
board  one  ship,  stark  naked,  to  be  fed  but  twice  a  day. 
Slavers,  when  chased,  have  been  known  to  throw 
slaves  overboard  in  casks,  to  give  them  to  the  sharks, 
or  in  extremities  to  blow  up  their  ship. 

6.  Price  of  a  Slave. — The  average  cost  price  of  a 
man  would  be  the  equivalent  of  four  yards  of  calico,  a 


124  AFRICA    WAITING 


flint-lock  musket,  a  6-lb.  keg  of  gunpowder,  a  2-gallon 
keg  of  rum,  with  beads  and  brass  wire.  Women  were 
a  quarter  cheaper  than  men.  The  selling  price  at 
Jamaica  averaged  £13  Is.  9<^.  two  hundred  years 
ago. 

7.  Decline  of  the  Trade. — The  traffic  did  not  pay, 
because  it  was  economically  unsound.  A  healthy 
trade  requires  peace,  but  the  slave  trade  imphed  a 
state  of  war.  No  monopoly  was  allowed  to  any  com- 
pany. Therefore,  each  was  faced  by  unlimited  com- 
petition. Worst  of  all,  the  West  Indian  planters 
demanded  cheap  labour. 

8.  Defence  of  the  Trade. — Eeasons  were  constantly 
urged  on  its  behalf.  The  seamen  pointed  out  truly 
enough  that  a  slave  would  be  killed  if  not  sold.  His 
absence  was  good  for  Africa,  and  the  better  for  the 
trade.  Members  of  Parliament  showed  that  it  found 
employment  for  several  classes,  alleging  that  it  was 
an  outlet  for  manufactures,  and  a  source  of  income  to 
the  S.P.G.,  which  was  spent  in  teaching  religion  to 
the  slaves !  Wilham  III.  and  George  11.  thought  it 
necessary  in  their  time,  while  Negro  potentates  and 
Bristol  merchants,  sea  captains  and  sugar  planters,  all 
agreed  as  to  its  benefit.  Did  not  the  slaves  like  it 
too? 

9.  Abolition  of  the  Trade. — Among  the  earhest 
English  protests  raised  against  the  trade  came  two 
from  Godwin,  a  Church  of  England  clergyman,  and 
Eichard  Baxter,  the  great  Nonconformist  divine. 
Montesquieu  led  the  way  in  France  in  1750.  The 
Quakers  and  Wesleyans  followed  ten  years  later.  And 
public  opinion  began  to  undergo  a  change  at  last,  when 
Lord  Mansfield  gave  his  memorable  judgment  from 
the  Bench  in  1772,  that  "  African  slavery  was  decided 
to  be  illegal  in  England."  The  efforts  of  Granville 
Sharp,  Clarkson,  Wilberforce,  and  Zachary  Macaulay 
are  well  known.  Pitt  and  Fox,  Burke,  Lord  Grey,  and 
Lord  Grenville,  all  pronounced  against  the  trade.  At 
last  the  Act  of  Abolition  of  the  Slave  Trade  was  passed 
in  1807,  and  the  noble  Act  of  Emancipation  in  1834, 


THE   SLAVE    TRADE   AND    THE   DRINK    TRAFFIC    1 25 

crowning  Buxton's  campaign  in  the  West  Indies  with 
success. 

But  Denmark  has  the  honour  of  being  the  first 
to  stop  the  traffic.  The  United  States  of  America 
followed  hard  in  1794,  by  forbidding  the  introduction 
of  slaves.  Next  in  order  came  Great  Britain,  Holland, 
France,  and  Portugal.  Of  special  importance  was  the 
Ashburton  Treaty  between  Great  Britain  and  the 
United  States  (1842),  when  it  was  decided  jointly  to 
maintain  a  naval  force  of  at  least  eighty  guns  on  the 
African  Coast.  Other  important  dates  to  remember  are 
the  annexation  of  Lagos  by  the  British  (1861),  the 
abolition  of  North  American  slavery  (1862),  the 
abolition  of  slavery  in  Brazil  (1888). 

Since  then  this  curse  to  Christendom  has  ceased, 
and  Africans  by  degrees  are  returning  to  Lagos,  and 
Liberia,  and  the  interior. 

The  Arab  Slave  Trade. 

The  moral  code  of  Islam  finds  a  place  for  slavery, 
undoubtedly,  and  all  Mohammedan  states  demand 
forced  labour.  Some  have  tried  to  show  that  "to 
associate  the  slave  trade  with  the  propagandism  of 
Islam  is  quite  as  unjust  as  to  couple  the  gin  traffic 
with  the  progress  of  Christianity."  But  the  fact 
remains  that  wherever  Islam  rules,  the  slave  trade 
continues  to  exist.  The  solution  to  the  problem  cannot 
finally  be  found  till  Arab  dominion  has  ceased  for  ever. 

The  regions  or  preserves  from  which  the  slaves  are 
drawn,  are,  broadly  speaking,  three  in  number : — 
1.  The  Sudan  (West  and  Central) ;  2.  The  Valley  of 
the  Nile  and  its  tributaries  ;  3.  East  Africa. 

The  Sudan  traffic  across  the  deserts  of  Sahara  has 
largely  increased  during  the  present  century,  and  for 
three  reasons.  Firstly,  the  Turkish  traffic  in  white 
men  has  ceased  for  ever.  Therefore  an  increasing 
demand  for  Negroes  has  arisen  instead.  Secondly, 
quite  recently,  a  powerful  sect  of  Islam,  named  after 
their  founder,  Mohammed  el-Senusi,  has  arisen  in 
Tripoli.     These  Senusi  are  a  large  religious  fraternity, 


126  AFRICA     WAITING 


and  make  proselytizing  wars  and  expeditions  far  and 
wide  Their  caravans  are  bringing  back  to  Jerbub 
(in  Tripoli)  yearly  trophies  of  the  faith.  Thirdly,  this 
century  has  seen  the  Fulah  shepherds  turn  into 
warriors,  and,  as  we  have  already  said,  Othman,  their 
prophet,  left  to  his  followers  the  great  empire  of 
Sokoto.  Heathen  unbelievers  in  Islam  may  be  en- 
slaved, and  so  the  trade  increased. 

Hitherto  the  region  raided  most  for  slaves  has  been 
Hausaland,  while  operations  have  extended  from  Lake 
Chad  almost  as  far  as  the  Guinea  Coast.  The  chief 
depots  have  been  Timbuctu  in  the  west,  and  Kuka  in 
the  east.  There  are  four  different  routes  across  the 
desert :  that  followed  by  Caille  when  he  entered  Tim- 
buctu; another  avoiding  Algeria,  and  coming  out  at 
Ghadames ;  a  third  from  Kuka  via  Murzuk ;  and, 
lastly,  a  secret  route,  known  only  to  the  Senusi,  from 
Wadai  to  their  capital.  The  ports  of  embarkation  for 
Turkey  are  both  in  Tripoli,  and  slaves  are  still  con- 
veyed to  Canea,  Salonica,  Constantinople,  and  Smyrna. 
Never  less  than  fifteen  caravans,  which  bring  out  ten 
thousand  captives  alive  to  tell  the  tale,  cross  the  desert 
every  year.  Mr.  Spont  estimates  that  40,000  victims 
fall  en  route,  and  it  is  said  you  cannot  lose  your 
way,  the  way  is  lined  with  human  skulls.  Cardinal 
Lavigerie  indignantly  speaks  of  "  women  tied  together 
in  lots,  some  with  children  in  arms,  all  laden  with 
cloth  and  plunder,  weary,  covered  with  weals  and 
scars.  Famine,  fever,  and  small-pox  claiming  victim 
after  victim,  the  fainting  ruthlessly  butchered  !  " 

The  Nile  Valley  traffic  is  due  to  different  causes. 
The  expansion  of  Egypt  under  Mehemet  Ali  was  one, 
for  it  increased  Egypt's  demand  for  domestic  servants. 
Moreover,  Europeans  successfully  prepared  the  way 
for  the  Arab  slave  trade  by  opening  up  the  Nile  water- 
ways. The  trade  then  became  a  commercial  venture. 
Arabs  poured  in  with  open-handed  villainy,  and  zeribas 
were  founded  everywhere.  Tribe  after  tribe  was 
instigated  to  tribal  war,  by  dint  of  promises  of  slaves 
and  ivory  from  the  profits.     Until  about  'thirty  years 


THE  SLAVE    TRADE   AND    THE    DRINK   TRAFFIC    1 2') 

ago  it  was  found  that  30,000  slaves  were  being  im- 
ported annually  into  Cairo.  But  since  the  Mahdi's 
rise  in  1882,  and  the  ruin  of  the  East  Sudan,  Meccrj, 
and  not  Cairo,  has  become  the  goal  of  every  gang.  For 
pilgrims  are  glad  to  purchase  slaves  in  Mecca  to  rid 
them  in  their  arduous  journey  home. 

Most  of  these  slaves  come  from  W.idai,  now  the  chief 
hunting-ground,  for  the  basin  of  the  Nile  hc^c  been 
almost  depopulated  by  these  ravages.  Darfur  and 
Kordofan  are  slave  centres,  Dongola,  Berber,  and 
Kassala,  up  till  recent  years,  have  been  the  ra  ying 
points.  From  thence  they  find  their  way  across  the 
Nubian  desert  and  the  Eed  Sea  under  cover  of  night, 
and  are  landed  at  or  near  to  Jedda,  the  port  of  Mecca. 
The  rest  are  gathered  from  the  Galla  races,  this  practice 
having  been  sanctioned  by  Menelik  of  Shoa,  the  Abys- 
sinian king.  Here  again  extension  of  his  empire  causcci 
the  trade.  His  victims  cross  the  Eed  Sea  further  south 
at  Tajurra  or  Eaheita,  and  are  landed  at  Hodeida, 
notwithstanding  the  vigilance  of  British  ships.  I  take 
Mr.  Spont's  moderate  estimate  in  1888  that  ove?^ 
60,000  have  been  made  victims  every  year,  making  this 
hideous  traffic  larger  than  that  of  the  Sudan, 

Schweinfurth  and  Baker,  Gordon  and  Felkin,  have 
all  testified  to  the  hopeless  ruin  of  these  lands.  Where 
on^e  there  stood  prosperous  villages  and  plots  of 
cultivated  lands,  now  forest  wastes  remain,  and  only 
one-third  of  a  former  population. 

East  African  Traffic. — The  origin  of  this  trade 
cannot  be  traced.  We  only  know  that  the  Portuguese 
had  a  considerable  share  in  it.  Linschoten,  the 
Dutchman,  just  three  hundred  years  ago,  spoke  of 
"great  numbers  of  Caffres^  (negroes)  carried  from 
Mozambique  into  India."  The  former  existence  of  a 
great  slave  market  at  Goa  is  well  known.  Between 
1820  and  1845  four  treaties  were  made  by  the  British 
Government  with  former  rulers  and  Sultans  of 
Zanzibar,  but  all  these  measures  are  shown  by  Sir

Bartle  Frere  to  have  failed  in  effecting  their  object. 
David  Livingstone  was  the  first  to  rouse  Britain, 
Europe,  and  America  to  some  sense  of  the  awful 
miseries  being  inflicted  upon  Africa.  Harrowing 
are  the  sober  accounts,  in  *'  The  Zambesi  and  its 
Tributaries"  and  his  "  Last  Journals,"  of  the  horrors 
of  the  capture  and  the  march,  the  cruelty  of  the 
slave-stick,  and  the  barbarous  treatment  by  half- 
caste  Arabs  of  men  women,  and  children — while 
wholesale  devastation,  and  even  depopulation  of  large 
districts,  by  murder  and  slave-hunting,  was  taking 
place. 

But  let  three  trans -African  travellers  speak  for 
themselves.  Cameron  tells  of  "■  bleached  skulls  by  the 
roadside,  skeletons  of  human  hands  attached  to  poles." 
Stanley  adds,  "  My  eyes  catch  sight  of  that  continual 
lifting  of  the  hand  to  ease  the  neck  in  the  collar.  .  .  . 
Many  have  been  months  fettered,  their  bones  stand  out 
in  bold  relief  in  the  skin,  which  hangs  in  wrinkles  and 
puckers."  And  Livingstone  quietly  remarks,  "  It 
was  wearisome  to  see  the  skulls  and  bones  scattered 
about  everywhere  ;  one  would  fain  not  notice  them, 
but  they  are  so  striking  as  one  trudges  along  the  sultry 
path  that  it  cannot  be  avoided." 

**  Europe  awoke  to  pity  and  to  heal." — In  1872  Sir 
Bartle  Frere  was  sent  on  a  special  mission  to  Zanzibar. 
After  a  thorough  investigation  into  the  reasons  why 
former  treaties  were  inefficient,  he  prepared  the  way 
for  Dr.,  now  Sir  John,  Kirk,  to  make  a  better  treaty 
with  the  Sultan  in  1873.  All  carrying  of  slaves  by 
sea  was  to  be  abolished,  and  all  public  markets  for 
buying  and  selling  imported  slaves  were  to  be  closed. 
Further  edicts,  notably  one  of  great  stringency  in  1890, 
forbade  all  traffic  in  slaves  and  allowed  any  slave  to 
purchase  his  freedom.  At  the  same  time  the  Sultan 
accepted  the  protectorate  of  Great  Britain.  Latest 
legislation  has  abolished  the  legal  status  of  slavery  in 
Zanzibar  and  Pemba  (1897),  but  this  has  by  no  means 
solved  the  problem.  Would  that  all  the  complications 
to  complete  emancipation  could  be  removed ! 


THE   SLAVE    TRADE   AND    THE   DRINK    TRAFFIC    1 29 

There  have  always  been  three  main  routes  followed 
by  the  slave-dealer,  (a)  From  the  Albert  Lake  vi& 
Lake  Eudolph  to  Magadosha  ;  (6)  from  the  tributaries 
of  the  Congo  mob  Nyangwe,  Ujiji,  and  Unyanyembe  to 
the  East  Coast ;  (c)  from  the  Zambesi  and  its  tribu- 
taries to  Kilwa. 

Those  districts  which  have  been  most  ill-treated  are 
the  Manyema,  Msidi's  kingdom,  the  Nyasa  coasts,  and 
regions  round  the  Victoria  Nyanza.  But  the  fall  of 
the  Congo  Arabs  in  1893,  the  establishment  of  the 
British  Colony  of  Nyasaland,  and  the  British  and 
German  Protectorates  in  East  Africa,  have  made  the 
transport  of  slaves,  in  dhows,  a  risky  undertaking.  The 
settled  destination  of  these  slaves  has  been  to  Muscat 
and  the  Persian  Gulf,  but  also  to  Madagascar  and  the 
Comoro  Isles,  where  a  kind  of  forced  labour,  called 
Fanampoana,  is  expected  of  them. 

Difficulties  of  Suppression. — Avery  brief  review 
of  the  sorrowful  extent  of  African  slave  trade  has  been 
given.  From  this  we  have  proved  emphatically  that 
slavery  still  thrives. 

What  can  be  done  to  rid  Dark  Africa  from  this 
awful  curse  ?  There  are  great  difficulties  in  the  way 
of  any  quick  suppression. 

One  serious  obstruction  we  are  met  with  at  the  out- 
set. For  fifteen  years  the  greater  part  of  the  Sudan  has 
been  closed  to  Europe,  and  the  central  regions  are  a 
sphere  in  which  European  influence  must  be  insignifi- 
cant for  many  years  to  come.  The  eastern  regions 
have  been  lost  by  insurrection  and  apostasy,  only  now 
to  be  slowly  regained.  The  western  districts  seem 
most  full  of  hope.  For  British  influence  will  be 
established,  at  least  as  far  as  Lake  Chad,  by  the 
battle  of  Bida.  Let  us  then  pray  for  Christian 
statesmen  and  missionaries  to  occupy  these  lands. 

A  second  difficulty  has  been  due  in  part  to  an 
unfortunate  action  by  the  German  East  African 
Company,  resulting  in  an  Arab  rising  and  destruction 
of  European  influence  on  the  Bast  Coast.  Lastly,  the 
climate  is  against  us. 


130  AFRICA    WAITING 


Methods  of  Extirpation. — There  are  three  royal 
roads  to  the  final  emancipation  of  Africa — peace,  com- 
merce, and  Christianity. 

The  following  are  some  of  the  ways  that  are  being 
tried  to  lead  to  them.  The  blockade  of  the  coast,  firm 
bases  of  operation,  treaties  with  native  chiefs,  control 
of  importation  of  fire-arms,  armed  forces  of  police, 
improved  navigation  of  rivers  and  lakes,  railways 
where  necessary  to  render  transport  cheaper.  The 
introduction  of  new  kinds  of  trade,  the  development 
of  existing  commerce,  European  settlements  in  high- 
land districts,  Native  Christian  settlements  on  the 
coast. 

There  are  three  such  Native  Christian  settlements  on 
the  West  Coast,  in  Sierra  Leone,  Liberia,  and  Lagos, 
and  foui  upon  the  East  Coast,  at  Mombasa,  Zanzibar, 
Magila  and  Kisserawe.  These  have  for  long  been 
recognized  as  bases  of  operation  for  missions.  They 
are  exceedingly  valuable  centres  for  translational  and 
educational  work.  Already  numbers  of  evangelists 
have  been  trained  up  and  sent  back  to  their  native 
lands  to  preach  the  Gospel.  They  need  the  ablest 
African  missionaries  for  their  development.  ''For 
Africa's  redemption  the  Negro  is  the  chosen  instru- 
ment." 

The  Liquor  Traffic. 

The  facts  about  the  drink  trafi5c  are  these.  With 
the  extension  of  European  influence  in  Africa,  there 
has  come  an  increased  market  for  European  goods. 
From  the  very  first  traders  in  spirits  found  ready 
purchasers  among  the  natives.  Often  before  the 
natives  had  reaped  the  benefits  of  commerce,  spirit 
merchants  had  given  them  a  taste  for  intoxicating 
liquors,  and  liquors  which  in  many  cases  are  proved 
to  be  of  the  most  vicious  kind. 

Such  a  demand  has  now  been  created  that,  in 
the  Niger  Delta,  gin  has  become  the  currency  of  the 
country. 

Testimony     of    Travellers. — The    late    Joseph 


THE   SLAVE    TRADE   AND    THE    DRINK    TRAJ^FIC    I3I 

Thomson,  in  a  speech  at  Manchester  ten  years  ago, 
said  with  reference  to  the  gin  trade  : — *'  In  these  facts 
Hes  the  secret  of  the  astoundingly  small  progress  our 
West  Coast  settlements  have  made."  Sir  Eichard 
Burton  went  still  further  in  his  book  on  Abeokuta 
when  he  wrote  : — "■  It  is  my  sincere  belief  that  if  the 
slave  trade  were  revived  with  all  its  horrors,  and 
Africa  could  get  rid  of  the  white  man,  with  the  gun- 
powder and  rum  which  he  has  introduced,  Africa 
would  be  the  gainer  by  the  exchange."  Bishop 
Tugwell,  after  having  travelled  throughout  Yoruba 
and  the  Niger  Protectorate,  has  recently  spoken  most 
strongly  from  personal  knowledge,  as  to  the  mischief 
done  to  missionary  work,  and  the  demoralizing  effect  of 
the  liquor  traffic  upon  the  morals  of  the  people.  It  is 
also  the  testimony  of  British  and  German  merchants 
that  ''  the  working  capacity  of  the  Negroes  is  paralyzed 
by  its  influence." 

Native  Protests. — Khama,  paramount  chief  of  the 
Bamangwato,  in  his  speech  at  Grosvenor  House, 
London,  in  November,  1895,  said  : — "  I  do  not  rejoice 
to  see  drink  in  my  town  to-day.  Strong  drink  cannot 
travel  from  a  country  by  itself,  but  always  takes  with 
it  a  great  many  other  things,  things  which  bring  a 
man  into  the  fire.  Strong  drink  knows  war  wherever 
it  is.  You  are  the  people  who  give  us  missionaries 
to  teach  us,  yet  strong  drink  does  and  will  hinder  the 
work  of  missionaries." 

Bishop  Oluwole  tells  us  that  Christians,  Moham- 
medans, and  Pagans  in  Abeokuta  have  held  a  great 
meeting  in  the  largest  church  to  protest  against  the 
traffic  in  spirits.  A  similar  meeting  has  been  held  at 
Lokoja,  and  a  petition  signed  by  400  natives  in  Arabic 
and  Hausa. 

Prohibition  to  Natives  is  really  in  force  in  Natal, 
British  Bechuanaland,  Transvaal,  Zululand,  Basuto- 
land,  and  ^ths  of  the  Eoyal  Niger  Company's  Terri- 
tory. But  it  is  not  practicable  in  all  parts  of  Africa. 
Much  more,  however,  might  be  done  to  restrict  the 
liquor  traffic  by  heavy  dues.  This  is  being  done  with

great  success  by  Col.  Cardew,  the  present  Governor  of 
Sierra  Leone ;  and  to  counteract  a  temporary  decrease 
in  the  revenue,  the  trade  returns  have  already  begun  to 
increase. 

The  Native  Races  and  Liquor  Traffic 
United  Committee  1  was  founded  in  1887,  consisting 
of  delegates  appointed  by  twenty-six  Missionary  and 
Temperance  Societies  in  the  British  Isles.  It  has 
collected  and  pubhshed  a  large  amount  of  information 
from  traders,  travellers,  missionaries,  and  others  in 
support  of  its  statements,  and  has  from  time  to  time 
called  the  attention  of  the  British  and  other  Govern- 
ments to  the  matter.  It  has  also  secured  energetic 
action  from  Pastor  Miiller,  who  has  been  able  to  form 
a  German  United  Committee,  and  to  present  a  petition 
to  the  German  Chancellor. 

Legislation. — At  the  Brussels  Conference  of 
1890-91,  the  principle  of  International  Agreement  was 
estabhshed,  and  an  area  was  legislated  for,  equalHng 
one-fifth  of  the  habitable  portion  of  the  Globe,  from 
20°  N.  latitude  to  22°  S.  latitude.  It  was  unani- 
mously agreed  that  it  should  be  iUegal  almost  every- 
where within  this  region  for  intoxicating  liquors  to  be 
introduced.  The  Powers  pledged  themselves  to  assist 
those  kings  and  chiefs  who  desired  to  free  their  peoples 
from  the  influence  of  such  liquors,  and  in  already 
infected  countries  a  uniform  minimum  duty  was 
established  of  fifteen  francs  per  hectolitre  (about  6^d. 
per  gallon).  The  result  has  been  that  a  tariff,  far  from 
being  uniform,  has  been  instituted.  The  following 
Table,  as  prepared  by  the  Colonial  Ofl&ce  in  1896,  gives 
the  duty,  per  proof  gallon  (imperial),  in  each  of  the 
possessions  on  the  West  Coast.  The  names  of  the 
possessions  have  been  placed  in  geographical  order, 
going  from  north  to  south. 

It  should  be  noted  that  as  different  standards  prevail

The  Present  Crisis. — We  cannot  do  better  than 
close  with  this  the  latest  resolution  passed  at  Grosvenor 
House  on  May  25th,  1897,  by  those  interested  in  the 
welfare  of  the  Negro  race  : — 

*'  That  in  view  of  the  admitted  evil  of  the  Liquor 
Traffic  amongst  the  Native  Races  of  Africa,  and  of  the 
danger  which  now  exists  of  a  rapid  extension  of  the 
trade  into  the  interior  owing  to  the  development  of 
railways  in  various  parts  of  Africa,  and  seeing  that  the 
year  1898  is  the  date  that  was  fixed  by  the  Powers 
for  reconsidering  the  Liquor  Clause  of  the  Brussels 
General  Act  of  1890-91,  and  that  the  Governments  of 
Great  Britain  and  Germany  have  signified  their  readi- 
ness to  consider  the  possibihty  of  effectually  restricting 
the  trade;  this  meeting  feels  that  the  time  has  now 
come  for  further  and  more  effective  international  co-

operation  in  this  matter,  and  ventures  respectfully  to 
press  Her  Majesty's  Government  to  take  the  initiative, 
either  by  calling  together  a  Conference  of  all  the 
Powers  assembled  at  the  Brussels  Conference,  or  by 
obtaining  an  agreement  between  those  Powers  possess- 
ing territory  in  Africa,  as  may  seem  best,  in  order  that, 
wherever  possible,  the  trade  in  spirits  may  be  pro- 
hibited ;  and  where  this  is  not  deemed  possible,  this 
meeting  would  venture  to  urge  on  Her  Majesty's 
Government  that  there  should  be  a  constantly  in- 
creasing duty,  commencing  at  not  less  than  four 
shillings  per  gallon,  and  that  the  duty  should  be 
uniform  in  all  the  Colonies  and  Protectorates  on  the 
West  Coast.  This  meeting  would  press  this  matter  the 
more  strongly,  that  Her  Majesty's  reign  may  be  made 
even  more  illustrious  by  the  removal  of  what  has  long 
been  a  blot  upon  the  advancing  civilization  of  Africa." 


CHAPTEE  VIII. 

THE   EVANGELIZATION   OF   AFRICA. 

In  the  foregoing  chapters,  some  of  the  geographical, 
ethnological,  philological,  commercial,  and  religious 
problems  that  Africa  presents  have  been  touched  upon. 
Let  us  now  gather  up  some  of  the  facts  in  the  form  of 
a  mnemonic,  and  seek  to  face  the  task  of  Africa's 
evangelization  in  this  generation.

Further  scrutiny  of  these  and  the  former  tables  bring 
out  some  very  important  points.  It  will  be  seen  that 
there  are  two  black  men  to  every  white  man  (or 
Caucasian)  in  Africa.  Again,  the  northern  half  of  the 
Dark  Continent,  and  this  including  the  great  deserts  of 
Sahara,  contains  twice  as  many  inhabitants  as  the 
southern  half. 

Now  Christendom  has  never  dealt  fairly  with  the 
Continent.  Broadly  speaking,  there  are  twice  as  many 
missionaries  in  the  south  as  there  are  in  the  north, 
notwithstanding  the  north  having  double  the  population 
of  the  south.  This,  when  put  another  way,  reveals 
the  need  of  Northern  Africa  to  be  fourfold  that  of 
Southern  Africa. 

Field  and  Force. 

Further : — 

Northern  Africa  has  one  Protestant  missionary  to 
125,000  Mohammedans. 

The  Sahara  has  one  Protestant  missionary  to 
2,500,000  Mohammedans. 

The  Sudan  States  have  one  Protestant  missionary 
to  45,000,000  Mohammedans  and  Pagans. 

West  Africa  has  about  one  Protestant  missionary 
to  30,000  Pagans. 

Central  Africa  has  one  Protestant  missionary  to 
80,000  Pagans. 

Southern  Africa  has  one  Protestant  missionary  to 
14,000  Pagans. 

These  missionaries  come  from  forty  Protestant 
missionary  societies. 

A  Contrast.,  1837  ^^^  ^897. 

There  is  much,  however,  to  encourage  us,  on 
looking  back.  When  Queen  Victoria  ascended  the 
throne,  Krapf  had  not  yet  set  out  either  for  Abyssinia 
or  East  Africa,  nor  had  Townsend  thought  of  entering 
Yoruba  ;   and  Livingstone  had  just  completed  his  first 


THE  EVANGELIZATION  OF  AFRICA  I37 

session  at  Glasgow  in  the  study  of  medicine.  Now 
every  year  adds  colour  to  the  map  of  Africa,  and  all 
the  leading  features  of  the  continent  are  known. 

An  even  deeper  lesson  is  taught  us  by  Bible  transla- 
tion.^ In  1837  one  Bible  version  in  Amharic  was 
nearly  ready  for  Abyssinia.  Now  the  list  of  actually 
existent  translations  of  the  whole  Bible  into  African 
languages  stands  at  ten.  Besides  this,  there  are  ten 
New  Testaments  in  other  languages,  while  sixty 
beginnings  have  been  made  upon  some  Gospel  or  Old 
Testament  Book. 

In  South  Africa  the  Zulu  Bible  owes  its  existence  to 
the  American  Bible  Society,  and  the  Sechuana  was 
the  life-long  work  of  Eobert  Moffat,  the  Scotchman. 
French  missionaries  gave  the  Word  of  Life  to  the 
Basutos,  and  German  missionaries  revised  this  version 
and  the  Kaffir  Bible. 

In  Western  Africa  there  are  now  two  Bibles  on  the 
Gold  Coast,  and  one — the  Yoruba — in  the  interior. 
The  New  Testament  in  Hausa  is  out  of  print,  but 
other  New  Testaments  and  clusters  of  books,  or  at 
least  single  Gospels,  brings  the  West  Coast  total  up  to 
twenty-seven.  Still  greater  progress  has  been  made 
in  East  Africa,  where  the  Arab  element  somewhat 
lifts  up  their  mental  condition.  The  East  African  list 
now  includes  twenty-eight  names,  two  whole  Bibles 
standing  out  from  all  the  rest. 

The  Swahili  Bible  has  received  attention  already. 
Dr.  Cust  assigns  to  this  version  the  twelfth  place  in 
the  order  of  relative  importance  of  the  chief  Bibles  in 
the  world,  whether  viewed  from  the  point  of  view  of 
numerical  or  geographical  opportunity.  While  the 
Uganda  version  is  the  crowning  addition  of  1896  to 
the  Bibles  of  the  world.  And  it  was  the  Swahili 
Bible  that  prepared  the  way  for  this  translation  ;  so 
that  Bible  has  grown  out  of  Bible,  as  mission  out  of 
mission.  "  Our  works  and  its  results,"  says  Living- 
stone, "are  cumulative."  Lastly,  steps  are  being 
taken  in  Nyasaland  to  form  one  Bible  version  and  one

language  for  the  various  tribes  around.  The  Nyanja 
dialect  has  been  selected,  and  should  prove  a  unifying 
force  all  over  British  Central  Africa. 

Closed  Doors. — Two  regions  of  the  continent, 
however,  are  closed  to  Christendom.  They  call  for 
special  prayers.  Ever  since  the  campaign  of  Magdala 
(1868)  the  land  of  Abyssinia  and  of  Alexandrian 
Christianity  has  been  closed  to  missionaries.  More 
recently,  the  insurrection  of  the  Mahdi  (1882)  spread 
in  a  region  five  times  the  area  of  the  British  Isles, 
and  Egypt  only  gradually  regains  her  captured  terri-

Solution  of  the  African  Problem  by  A.  M. 
Mackay  of  Uganda. 

"How,  then,  is  Africa  to  be  Christianized?  The 
problem  to  be  solved  and  the  conditions  of  the  case 
were  pretty  much  the  same  in  Europe,  once  as  they 
are  now  in  Africa.  ...  In  endeavouring  to  span  the 
Continent  of  Africa,  we  must  keep  three  conditions 
constantly  in  mind.  (1)  The  nature  of  the  founda- 
tion. (2)  The  materials  at  disposal.  (3)  The  con- 
ditions under  which  the  workmen  will  have  to  build." 

"  The  Pier  Principle  is  that  hitherto  adopted  in  Africa 
in  Mission  work.  Lines  of  stations  have  been  planted, 
but  too  frequently  in  unhealthy  centres,  and  these,  like 
piers  on  a  bad  foundation,  have  frequently  collapsed, 
hence  gaps  are  constantly  occurring." 

"  Others  have  tried  the  suspension  principle,  but  with 
no  better  success.  A  tower  of  strength  has  been  built 
on  each  side  of  the  mighty  chasm — one  at  Freetown, 
the  other  at  Frere  Town — and  strong  links  have  been 
hung  out  from  either  side  'n  the  hope  of  uniting  in  the 
centre." 

*'  To  span  the  Firth  of  Forth  they  adopted  the 
principle  called  the  cantilever.  At  each  side  of  the 
jirth  a  high  tower  was  built.     Each  of  these  towers 


THE   EVANGELIZATION  OF  AFRICA  I39 


was  like  the  upright  stem  of  a  balance,  for  frora  each 
side  of  the  tower  an  arm  was  built  outwards,  one  to  the 
right  and  one  to  the  left.  For  every  foot  in  length 
that  was  added  to  the  seaward  arm,  a  similar  arm  was 
added  to  the  landward  arm,  so  as  to  make  the  balance 
even.  The  seaward  arms  on  each  side,  however,  were 
not  continued  until  they  met,  but  stopped  short  when 
their  extremities  were  several  hundred  feet  from  each 
other.  To  fill  this  gap  an  ordinary  girder  was  placed, 
having  its  ends  resting  on  the  seaward  ends  of  the  two 
cantilevers." 

"  Let  us  adopt  this  principle  by  analogy  as  our  solu- 
tion of  the  African  problem.  Let  us  select  particularly 
healthy  sites,  on  each  of  which  we  shall  raise  an 
institution  for  imparting  a  thorough  education,  even  to 
only  a  few.  Let  there  be  secured,  among  our  friends 
at  home,  a  guarantee  of  sufficient  amount  to  support 
every  man  added  to  the  staff  abroad.  .  .  .  This  is  the 
land-arm  of  the  cantilever,  and  the  man  in  the  field 
is  the  seaward  arm.  These  institutions  should  be 
placed  sufficiently  far  apart  so  as  not  to  interfere  with 
each  other.  Lovedale  and  Blythswood  in  South  Africa 
are  types  already  successful.  .  .  .  The  agency  by 
which,  and  probably  by  which  alone,  we  can  Chris- 
tianize Africa,  is  the  African  himself,  but  he  must 
first  be  trained  to  that  work  by  the  European  in 
Africa. 

This  scheme  is  much  the  same  as  that  adopted  by 
the  monks  for  the  Christianization  of  Europe,  and 
which  is  pursued  by  the  Eomanists  to  the  present 
day.

"  I  am  ready  to  go  to  Sierra  Leone  and  die  for  the 
name  of  the  Lord  Jesus." 

"  For  my  part  I  feel  just  like  a  bird  in  a  cage.  .  .  . 
My  mind  is  wandering  into  the  interior  of  Africa.     Is

this  mere  imagination  ?  Lord,  hast  Thou  designed  me 
to  proceed  from  hence  into  other  parts  of  Africa? 
Here  am  I ;  send  me." — W.  A.  B.  Johnson. 

"  The  resurrection  of  East  Africa  must  be  effected 
by  our  own  destruction." 

"  My  spirit  often  urged  me  to  go  behind  a  large  tree 
at  a  Httle  distance  from  the  village  ...  to  weep  and 
pray  that  the  Eedeemer's  Kingdom  might  soon  be 
established  in  these  heights,  and  that  His  songs  might 
be  heard  on  these  lofty  hills  ;  and  in  full  reliance  on 
the  promises  of  God  I  took  possession  of  the  Pagan 
land  for  the  mihtant  Church  of  Christ." — /.  L.  Krapf. 

*'  In  order  to  make  any  impression  on  the  Kaffir 
mind  there  must  be  much  self-denial." — Bishop  Gray. 

*'  Others  will  not  go,  so  I  will." — Bishop  Mackenzie. 

*'  He  is  the  man  in  Zanzibar  who  prays  to  God  for 
all  us  Africans,  and  tries  in  every  way  to  do  all  the 
good  he  can."

"  Africa  seems  to  have  been  invented  to  teach  one

SO  shine,'  &c.  Where  is  light  most  needed  ?  Without 
question  in  Dark  Dark  Africa.  Then  let  my  light 
blaze  out  for  Christ  in  Africa." — Bishop  Hill. 

"  Ask  that  young  man  if  there  is  any  reason  why  he 
should  not  take  Christ  as  his  Saviour." 
Bishop  Hill  in  his  dying  delirium  pleading  with  souls. 

David  Livingstone's  last  public  words  in  Scot- 
land : — 

"  Fear  God,  and  work  hard." 

"  Providence  seems  to  call  me  to  the  regions  beyond 
.  .  .  so  powerfully  convinced  am  I  that  it  is  the 
will  of  the  Lord  that  I  should  go  ;  I  will  go  no  matter 
who  opposes.'' — D.L.,  1852. 

"  Anywhere — provided  it  be  forward." 

"  People  talk  of  the  sacrifice  I  have  made  in  spend- 
ing so  much  of  my  life  in  Africa.  .  .  .  It  is 
emphatically  no  sacrifice,  say  rather  it  is  a  privilege. 
.  .  .  I  beg  to  direct  your  attention  to  Africa ;  I 
know  that  within  a  few  years  I  shall  be  cut  off  in  that 
country  which  is  now  open ;  do  not  let  it  be  shut 
again  !  I  go  back  to  Africa  to  try  to  make  an  open 
path  for  commerce  and  Christianity  ;  do  you  carry  out 
the  work  which  I  have  begun ;  I  leave  it  with  you." 

D.  L.,  December ^  1857,  Senate  House,  Cambridge. 

"  Nothing  earthly  will  make  me  give  up  my  work  in 
despair.  I  will  comfort  myself  in  the  Lord  my  God 
and  go  forward." 

"  I  could  forget  all  my  cold,  hunger,  sufferings  and 
toil,  if  I  could  be  the  means  of  putting  a  stop  to  the 
cursed  traffic." 

"  Perhaps  God  in  His  providence  will  arrest  the 
attention  of  the  world  to  this  hideous  traffic  by  some 
unlooked-for  means." — D.L.  07i  the  Slave  Trade. 

"  You  don't  know  what  you  can  do,  until  you  try." 

D.L.,from  Ujiji,  1871. 


In  Memoriam. 

■  Open  the  Abbey  doors  and  bear  him  in 

To  sleep  with  king  and  statesman,  chief  and  sage, 

The  missionary  come  of  weaver  kin, 

But  great  by  work  that  brooks  no  lower  wage. 

He  needs  no  epitaph  to  guard  a  name 

Which   men   shall   prize   while   worthy  work   is 
known  ; 
He  lived  and  died  for  good — be  this  his  fame  : 

Let  marble  crumble  :  this  is  Living-stone."

Mackay's  last  message  from   Usambiro,  Lake  Victoria, 
Jan.  2nd,  1890  :— 

'*  You  sons  of  England,  here  is  a  field  for  your 
energies.  Bring  with  you  your  highest  education 
and  your  greatest  talents  :  you  will  find  scope  for  the 
exercise  of  them  all.  You  men  of  God,  who  have 
resolved  to  devote  your  lives  to  the  cure  of  the  souls 
of  men,  here  is  the  proper  field  for  you.  It  is  not  to 
win  numbers  to  a  Church,  but  to  win  men  to  the 
Saviour,  and  who  otherwise  will  be  lost,  that  I  entreat 
you  to  leave  your  work  at  home  to  the  many  who  are 
ready  to  undertake  it,  and  to  come  forth  yourselves  to 
reap  this  field  now  white  to  the  harvest.  Eome  is 
rushing  in  with  her  salvation  by  sacraments,  and  a 
religion  of  carnal  ordinances.  We  want  men  who 
will  preach  Jesus  and  the  Eesurrection.  *  God  is  a 
Spirit,'  and  let  him  who  believes  that  throw  up  ever} 
other  consideration  and  come  forth  to  teaon  these 
people  to  worship  Him  in  spirit  and  in  truth." 


APPENDIX  A. 

RULES  FOR  THE  PRESERVATION  OF  HEALTH  IN  THE 
TROPICS. 

Taken  from  "■  Ghiide  to  Health  in  Africa,'*  pp.  151-2,  by 
Surgeon-Major  T.  H.  Parke. 

Water. — All  drinking-water,  no  matter  how  sparkling 
and  pure,  should  be  invariably  boiled,  to  insure  its 
freedom  from  dangerous  constituents.  Cold  weak  tea, 
without  sugar  or  milk,  is  best  for  the  march.  Water 
should  always  be  drawn  from  up-stream,  and  from  the 
centre,  if  possible.  Two  grains  of  permanganate  of 
potash  to  the  quart  purifies  water.     If  muddy,  use  alum. 

Sun. — No  precautions  can  be  too  great  for  protecting 
the  head  from  the  direct  rays  of  the  sun.  The  use  of 
a  proper  head-dress  and  umbrella,  also  a  spinal  pad 
for  morning  and  evening  sun,  is  judicious. 

Chills,  draughts,  sitting  in  damp  clothes,  especially 
when  heated  after  violent  exercise  and  copious  per- 
spiration, also  cooling  of  the  body  suddenly  in  any 
way,  are  certain  to  be  followed  by  fever. 

Sleep  as  far  as  possible  off  the  ground,  and  always 
under  mosquito  curtains  at  night. 

Diet  should  be  plain;  meat,  fish,  vegetables,  well- 
boiled  fruit,  rice  and  cereals. 

Alcohol  during  the  day  is  most  dangerous. 

Tub  in  the  early  morning,  or  at  the  end  of  a  march, 
before  cooling ;  never  while  digestion  is  going  on,  and 
always  tepid,  if  possible. 

Camp. — Select  highland  plateau  near  water  supply. 
Don't  disturb  the  soil.  Avoid  ravines.  Never  to  lee- 
ward of  a  swamp,  unless  separated  by  a  belt  of  trees 
or  a  river.  Site  of  latrine  should  be  selected  imme- 
diately on  halting,  and  covered  with  a  hurdle  and  sods 
so  as  to  exclude  flies,  as  they  convey  poison,  leaving 
only  a  few  openings,  each  about  one  foot  square. 
Directly  tent  is  pitched  hoe  a  gutter  close  to  the 
walls. 

Cleanliness. — Hair  should  be  cut  short. 


APPENDIX 


145 


Clothing. — The  bodily  temperature  should  be  kept 
as  equable  as  possible.  Loosely  fitting  woollen  clothes 
%re  preferable.  Light  kamarband  should  be  worn  day 
and  night.  On  halting  after  a  march,  put  on  a  wrapper 
so  as  to  cool  gradually.  Get  under  cover  and  change, 
if  possible.

BOOKS  FOR  MISSION  STUDY 

The  Evangelization  of  the  World  in  This  Generation.    By  John  R. 

Mott.    Bibliography,  analytical  index.    i2mo,  245  pp.;  paper, 

35  cents  ;  cloth  decorated,  gilt  top,  $1.00. 

It  is  strong,  graphic,  and  full  of  ^XQ..—Epworth  Herald. 

It  is  stimulating,  lucid,  and  convincing,  addressing  itself,  not  to  the 
emotions,  but  to  the  judgment,  yet  so  spiritual  in  tone  and  purpose  that  it 
encourages  and  inspires  the  reader.— r/;^  Sunday  School  Times. 

This  is  a  book  to  stimulate  zeal  for  the  mission  cause, —  The  Moravian. 

The  book  is  doubly  worth  the  reading,  both  for  its  moving  appeal  to  the 
universal  Christian  consciousness  and  for  the  timely  information  it  gives  as  to 
the  grand  sweep  of  modem  missionary  thought  and  effort,  the  wide-reaching 
activities  of  the  present,  and  the  marvelous  opportunities  of  the  future.— T^* 
Christian  Advocate. 

Nothing  better  can  be  found  to  give,  in  brief  and  compendious  review,  a 
summary  of  the  missionary  outlook  of  the  church  at  the  present  hour.— Rev. 
James  S.  Dennis,  D.D.,  in  The  Churchman. 

We  earnestly  commend  this  work  to  the  attention  of  ministers  and  students, 
and  of  all  who  are  interested  in  the  missionary  enterprise. — Free  Church  of 
Scotland  Monthly. 

Strategic  Points  in  the  World's  Conquest:   the  Universities  and 

Colleges  as  related  to  Christian  Progress.     By  John  R.  Mott. 

Map.     i2mo,  218  pp.;  cloth  decorated,  gilt  top,  85  cents. 

A  report  of  Mr.  Mott's  observations  during  his  twenty  months'  tour  around 

the  world,  in  the  course  of  which  he  visited  practically  all  the  colleges  and 

universities,  bringing  most  of  them  into  affiliation  with  the  World's  Student 

Christian  Federation.      The  Federation  is  the  last  tidemark  of  enlightened 

scholarship  ;    it  is  no  empty  name  which  Mr.  Mott  uses  for  his  book  ;    he 

merely  translates  into  four  words  the  meaning  of  a  movement  to  wed  religion 

to  our  schools,  to  confirm  the  connection  between  virtue  and  intelligence,  to 

garner  the  treasures  of  wisdom  and  piety. —  The  Evangelist. 

New  Testament  Studies  in  Missions,  being  outline  studies  covering 
the  missionary  teachings  of  the  four  Gospels  and  Acts  and 
the  Pauline  Epistles.  By  Harlan  P.  Beach.  i2mo,  80  pp.; 
interleaved  for  additional  references  and  MS.  notes,  outline 
map;  paper,  15  cents. 

An  intelligent  use  of  this  book  cannot  fail  to  deepen  interest  in  missions, 
and  lead  to  efficient  methods  of  work.— AVw  York  Observer. 

It   is    full  of  good  things  for  those  who    use    it  wisely. —Journal   and 

Messenger. 

The  Healing  of  the  Nations:  a  Treatise  on  Medical  Missions, 
Statement  and  Appeal.  By  J.  Rutter  Williamson,  M.B. 
Edinburgh  University.  Member  of  the  British  Medical  Asso- 
ciation. Bibliography.  i2mo,  95  pp.  ;  paper,  25  cents  ; 
cloth,  40  cents. 

The  appeal  made  by  thea-vvful  sufferings  endured  in  the  absence  of  medical 
relief  is  made  intense  by  the  facts  here  put  before  us,  and  the  success  of  the 
medical  missionary  as  a  pathbreaker  for  Christ  through  the  jungles  of  super- 
stition and  prejudice  is  put  beyond  a  doubt.— TA^  Outlook. 

This  is  a  little  volume  overflowing  with  important  truth..— The  Living 
^urch. 

While  the  argument  is  strong  and  convincing,  the  devotional  spirit  that 
pervades  the  whole  is  warm  and  Qv'xnzxvi^.— Presbyterian  Review.

ties are  most  trustworthy.— Arthur  H.  Smith,  in  the  Chinese  Recorder.

it  presents  in  compact  form  Japan's  past  and  present  history,  her  people  and 
religions,  and  the  work  of  missions  in  that  Empire.  It  is  lucid,  trustworthy, 
and  certain  to  interest  every  friend  of  missions  and  all  students  of  contem- 
porary history.— ya/a«  Evangelist.

Canon  F.  P.  L.  Josa,  Professor  J.  Taylor  Hamilton,  Rev. 
H.  C.  Tucker,  Rev.  C.  W.  Drees,  D.D.;  Rev.  I.  H.  LaFetra, 
Rev.  Thomas  B.  Wood,  LL.D.,  and  Mrs.  T.  S.  Pond.  Bibli- 
ography,  missionary  map,  analytical  index,  general  and 
missionary  statistics.  i2mo,  230  pp.;  paper,  35  cents  ;  cloth,

laboring  in  the  "  Neglected  Continent."  Having  been  written  by  recognized 
authorities  in  different  sections  of  the  continent,  it  meets  an  urgent  need. 

The  reading  or  study  of  this  volume  and  its  accompanying  tables  of  general 
and  missionary  statistics,  together  with  its  missionary  map,  will  surely  produce 
strong  convictions  as  to  Protestantism's  debt  to  this  promising  continent  of 
republics. —  The  Intercollegian.

lems of  each  of  the  four  great  sections  of  the  Dark  Continent ;  the  slave  trade 
and  the  drink  trafiBc. —  The  Sunday  School  Times.
