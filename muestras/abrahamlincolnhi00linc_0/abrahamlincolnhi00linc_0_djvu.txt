ABRAHAM  LINCOLN— HIS  BOOK. 


This  book— the  only  one  now  or  ever  extant 
of  its  illustrious  authorship— owes  its  exist- 
ence to  Ihe  political  campaign  of  1858,  when 
the  opposing  candidates  for  United  States 
Senator  from  Illinois  were  Abraham  Lincoln 
and  Stephen  A.  Douglas.  The  issue  was 
slavery- whether,  as  Mr.  Lincoln  contended, 
it  should  be  restricted  to  the  states  in  which 
it  already  existed,  or,  as  Judge  Douglas  advo- 
cated, it  should  be  permitted  to  invade  the 
new  territories  if  agreeable  to  the  people 
thereof. 

Mr.  Lincoln,  at  that  time,  did  not  advocate 
emancipation.  He  made  no  demand  for  the 
liberation  of  the  slaves  then  in  bondage.  lie 
made  no  plea  for  negro  citizenship.  While  he 
regarded  slavery,  as  he  had  declared  as  early 
as  1837,  as  "  founded  on  both  injustice  and 


-2  — 

bad  policy,"  and  of  course  hoped  for  ih 
"ultimate  extinction,'*  he  recognized  its  con- 
stitutional  status  in  the  states  in  which  it 
then  had  an  existence,  and,  without  any  pur- 
pose to  disturb  it  there,  raised  hi«  voice  only 
against  its  further  extension. 

His  position,  however,  was  constantly  mis- 
stated by  his  opponents.  Judge  Douglas  made 
the  charge  of  "abolitionism,"  and  the  accu- 
sation was  reiterated  throughout  the  stat«, 
from  the  beginning  to  the  end  of  the  cam- 
paign, by  Democratic  orators  and  newspapers. 
It  was  charged  that  Lincoln  stood  for  the 
equality  of  the  races,  politically  and  socially ; 
and  it  was  pointed  out,  with  alarm  and  in- 
dignation, that  should  his  doctrines  prevail, 
there  would  be  inevitable  social  and  political 
chaos.  Whites  and  blacks  would  intermarry 
promiscuously;  the  impassable  line  which 
had  so  long  separated  the  two  races  would  be 
wholly  obliterated;  the  hated  black  man 
would  be  invested  with  political  privileges 
which  hitherto  had  been  counted  the  whit€ 
man's  exclusive  and  sacred  rights. 


-3- 

There  were  few  sections  of  Illinois  whert 
jprejudice  against  the  negro  was  stronger  than 
fn  Sangamon  county,  the  home  of  Mr.  Lincoln. 
The  city  of  Springfield  and  the  adjacent 
country  was  inhabited  largely  by  natives  of 
Kentucky.  Before  coming  to  Illinois  they 
had  been  accustomed  to  slavery,  and,  while 
many  agreed  with  Mr.  Lincoln  that  the  insti- 
tution was  fundamentally  wrong  and  ought  to 
be  restricted,  tlie  remotest  suggestion  of  mak- 
ing a  negro  their  social  and  political  equal 
was  abhorrent.  It  was  this  prejudice  that  kept 
so  many  of  the  Whigs,  even  after  their  party 
was  manifestly  doomed  to  extinction,  from 
joining  the  new  Republican  party.  It  was 
this  influence  that  gave  Fillmore  his  strength 
in  Illinois  in  1856,  and,  by  dividing  the  anti- 
Democratic  forces,  gave  the  state's  electoral 
vote  to  Buchanan. 

,  The  widespread  fear  of  "negro  equality" 
was  at  once  recognized  by  Mr.  Lincoln  as  the 
most  portentous  obstacle  to  the  success  of 
the  new  party.  It  made  the  Old  Line  Whigs 
—his  life-long  political  associates— hesitant 


-4- 

wavering,  and  distrustful.  Some  of  them  had 
already  gone  over  to  the  Democracy. 

In  1857  there  was  no  longer  any  doubt  that 
the  Whig  party  could  never  survive  another 
election.  It  was,  in  truth,  already  dead. 
Many  of  the  Old  Whigs  of  Sangamon  county 
were  still  at  sea,  not  knowing  whither  to 
turn  for  safe  and  congenial  affiliations.  There 
were  really  but  two  courses  open — they  must 
join  the  new  Republican  party,  with  its  ad- 
vanced and  distrusted  doctrines  on  slavery,  or 
they  must  join  the  pro-slavery  Democracy, 
which  they  had  been  fighting  from  time  im- 
memorial. 

It  was  this  dilemma  which  brought  to- 
gether, one  day  in  that  year,  a  few  Sangamon 
county  men  who  long  had  been  prominent  in 
the  Whig  party  councils.  The  assemblage,  in 
a  retrospective  view,  was  notable  and  historic, 
though  at  the  time  it  was  but  a  quiet  confer- 
ence of  friends,  for  whose  proceedings  we  are 
indebted  wholly  to  a  trustworthy  tradition. 
There  were  present,  among  others.  Judge 
Stephen  T.  Logan  and  Major  John  T.  Stuart, 


—  5  — 

both  of  whom  had  been  Lincoln's  law  part- 
ners; Colonel  John  Williams,  Major  Elijah 
lies,  and  Captain  James  N.  Brown.  There  was 
a  full  and  frank  discussion  of  the  difficult 
problem.  Every  one  present  expressed  his 
views  and  intentions.  Some  had  joined  the 
Republicans  in  the  previous  year;  others 
were  now  ready  to  do  so,  while  several,  like 
Major  Stuart,  although  not  yet  prepared  to  go 
with  the  Democracy,  declared  that  they  never 
could  be  Republicans. 

Captain  Brown,  when  called  upon  to  state 
his  position,  said:  " My  friends,  I  have  been  a 
Whig  all  my  life.  I  cannot  be  a  Democrat. 
From  this  time  on,  I  am  a  Lincoln  Re- 
publican." 

Mr.  Lincoln,  up  to  this  point,  had  not  been 
present;  but  he  stepped  into  the  room  just  in 
time  to  hear  Captain  Brown's  declaration. 

This  conference  was  followed  by  another 
early  in  1858.  It  was  a  Republican  meeting 
this  time,  and  of  great  local  importance. 
Captain  Brown  was  there,  and  so  was  Lincoln. 
The  matter  under  consideration  was  the  per- 


_6- 

sonnel  of  the  local  ticket  for  the  campaign 
then  about  to  open.  The  master  spirit  of  the 
occasion  was  Mr.  Lincoln.  He  talked  at  length 
and  emphasized  the  importance  of  .  a  policy 
which  would  set  at  rest  the  minds  of  the  Old 
Whigs  who  still  remained  practically  without 
a  party— showing  them  that  the  new  party 
was  not  the  exponent  of  "abolitionism,"  as 
had  been  alleged  against  it,  but  that  it  stood 
only  for  the  conseryative  doctrine  of  the  re- 
striction of  slavery  to  existing  limitations. 
Captain  Brown,  like  Lincoln,  was  a  native  of 
Kentucky,  coming  of  a  distinguished  family 
of  that  state  (his  father.  Colonel  William 
Brown,  a  veteran  of  the  war  of  1812,  having 
served  in  Congress  with  Henry  Clay,  defeat- 
ing Colonel  Richard  M.  Johnson,  who  was  sub- 
sequently United  States  Senator  and  Vice- 
President).  He  had  been  a  life-long  Whig, 
and,  like  many  of  his  party  associates,  had 
kept  out  of  the  Republican  party  in  1856, 
voting  for  Fillmore.  He  had  long  been  a  per- 
sonal friend  of  Lincoln,  and  was,  moreover,  a 
man  of  blameless  reputation. 


_7- 

Mr.  Lincoln,  at  this  meeting,  urg^ed  the 
nomination  of  Captain  Brown  as  one  of  the 
party's  candidates  for  the  legislature.  Brown 
did  not  want  the  nomination,  and  said  so;  he 
had  served  four  terms  in  the  House  (including 
one  term  with  Lincoln,  back  in  1840  and  '41), 
and  was  now  averse  to  longer  public  service. 
But  Lincoln  was  insistent,  and  made  an  argu- 
ment which  disclosed  in  him  the  astute  poli- 
tician that  all  recognized  him  to  be. 

"You  must  run,"  he  said  to  Brown.  "We 
cannot,  must  not,  nominate  an  Eastern  man ; 
he  would  be  beaten.  We  must  have  the  votes 
of  the  Old  Line  Whigs.  You  have  been  a 
Whig;  you  are  a  Kentuckian;  you  have  been 
a  slave-holder.  You  will  get  the  support  of 
the  large  conservative  element — the  Old  Line 
Whigs  and  the  men  of  Southern  birth  and 
sympathies  who,  while  willing  to  let  slavery 
remain  where  it  is,  are  with  us  against 
its  further  extension,  but  who  would  be 
afraid  to  trust  an  Eastern  man,"  and  he 
called  off  the  names  of  a  half-hundred  Old 
Line  Whigs  of  local  prominence  who  would 


vote  for  such  a  man  as  Brown,  but  would  op» 
pose  a  candidate  of  Eastern  birth  or  of  doubt- 
ful antecedents. 

Captain  Brown,  persuaded  to  an  accept- 
ance by  Lincoln's  unanswerable  logic,  was 
later  nominated  for  the  lower  branch  of 
the  General  Assembly,  his  associate  on  the 
ticket  being  John  Cook,  son  of  a  Kentuckian, 
and  afterwards  a  Union  General  in  the  Civil 
War. 

Popular  feeling  was  intensified  as  the  cam- 
paign progressed.  The  old  prejudice  against 
the  negro,  inbred  in  the  men  of  Southern 
nativity — the  heritage  of  many  generations 
of  perverted  opinion — was  found  deep-rooted 
and  bitter.  Entering  upon  his  canvass.  Captain 
Brown  was  confronted  everywhere  with  the 
charge  that  Lincoln  stood  for  "  negro  equal- 
ity," social  and  political. 

"  Why,  Brown!"  his  old  friends  would  say, 
in  astonishment,  "  How  can  you,  a  Ken- 
tuckian, yourself  once  a  slaveholder,  stand 
for  a  Rlack  Abolitionist— a  man  who  says  the 
negro  is  your  equal  and  mine  f 


-9- 

Porsonally,  of  eoiirse,  Captain  Brown  un- 
derstood Lincoln's  position  perfectly;  but 
there  were  many  whom  he  found  it  impos- 
sible to  convince  that  Lincoln  held  no  such 
views  as  were  ascribed  to  him. 

He  felt  the  necessity  for  something  authori- 
tative—a statement  from  Mr.  Lincoln  himself, 
setting  forth  his  views  in  lucid  and  unmis- 
takable language.  Late  in  the  campaign  he 
asked  Mr.  Lincoln  for  such  a  statement.  Mr. 
Lincoln  went  over  his  published  speeches  for 
several  previous  years,  including  those  in  his 
debate  with  Douglas  just  then  concluded,  and 
clipped  out  whatever  he  had  said  on  the  sub- 
ject of  "negro  equality."  These  extracts  he 
pasted  into  a  small  pocket  memorandum  book, 
making  explanatory  notes  wherever  needed. 
He  supplemented  this  printed  matter  with  a 
letter  addressed  to  Captain  Brown,  filling 
eight  pages  of  the  little  book.  This  letter, 
containiw)g  the  essence  of  all  he  had  previously 
said,  was  the  most  recent  and  authoritative 
statement  of  his  views  which  he  could  pos- 
sibly have  made,  and  it  was  precisely  the 


-  10  — 

thin^  which  his  friend  and  supporter  had  felt 
the  need  of  throug:hout  his  canvass. 

The  close  of  the  campaign  was  near,  only 
about  two  weeks  of  it  remaining,  but  the 
time  was  fully  utilized  by  Captain  Brown. 
He  carried  the  book  in  his  pocket,  and  when- 
ever Lincoln's  "negro  equality"  views  were 
questioned — and  this  must  have  been  manj 
times  every  day,  in  the  course  of  his  public 
speeches  and  private  conversations— he  would 
produce  the  book  and  read  from  it  "  Lincoln's 
own  words,"  placed  there  by  Lincoln  himself 
only  a  few  days  before. 

But  no  argument  was  strong  enough  to  over- 
come the  prejudice  then  so  widespread  and 
unreasoning,  and  both  legislative  candidates 
(one  of  Southern  birth,  and  the  other  of 
Southern  ancestry)  failed  of  election. 

The  book,  of  course,  had  been  intended  bj 
Mr.  Lincoln  only  to  meet  a  temporary  require- 
ment, and  very  likely  he  had  no  idea  that  it 
would  survive  the  campaign  of  1858;  but 
Captain  Brown  carefully  preserved  it  and  must 
have  carried  it  with  him  in  1860  and  in  sub- 


sequent  campaigns,  for  he  filled  out  the  re- 
maining leaves  with  many  later  newspaper 
scraps  of  his  own  selection. 

Captain  Brown  died  in  1868.  The  Lincoln 
Scrap  Book  passed  to  his  sons  William  and 
Benjamin,  of  Grore  Park,  111.,  to  whom  we 
are  indebted  for  the  facts  pertaining  to  its 
history.  In  1900  tlie  book  was  sold  by  the 
Messrs.  Brown,  to  Mr.  William  H.  Lambert 
of  Philadelphia,  who  possesses  the  most 
complete  and  intelligently  arranged  Lincoln 
collection  in  existence. 

It  is  the  unique  renown  of  this  book  that  it 
is  the  only  one  eyer  written  or  compiled  by 
Abraham  Lincoln.  It  is  reproduced  here,  as 
nearly  as  possible,  precisely  as  it  came  from 
his  pen  and  his  hand.

NOTE.— On  the  opposite  page  is  the  "  scare 
head"  of  a  double-leaded  article  which  the 
"Illinois  State  Register"  kept  standing  in 
its  columns  for  some  time  previous  to  the 
election  of  1858.  The  "State  Register"  was 
the  organ  of  Senator  Douglas  at  the  State 
Capital.  The  article  illustrates  the  preemi-

campaign  of  1858,  from  the  Democratic  point
