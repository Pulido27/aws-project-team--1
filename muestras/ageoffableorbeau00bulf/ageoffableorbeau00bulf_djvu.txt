AUTHOR'S   PREFACE. 


If  no  other  knowledge  deserves  to  be  called  useful  but  that 
which  helps  to  enlarge  our  possessions  or  to  raise  our  station  in 
society,  then  Mythology  has  no  claim  to  the  appellation.  But 
if  that  which  tends  to  make  us  happier  and  better  can  be  called 
useful,  then  we  claim  that  epithet  for  our  subject ;  for  Mythol- 
ogy is  the  handmaid  of  literature,  and  literature  is  one  of  the  best 
allies  of  virtue  and  promoters  of  happiness. 

Without  a  knowledge  of  mythology  much  of  the  elegant  litera- 
ture of  our  own  language  cannot  be  understood  and  appreciated. 
When  Byron  calls  Rome  the  Niobe  of  nations,  or  says,  of  Venice, 
she  looks  a  sea-Cybele  fresh  from  ocean,  he  calls  up  to  the  mind 
of  one  familiar  with  our  subject  illustrations  more  vivid  and 
striking  than  the  pencil  could  furnish,  but  which  are  lost  to  the 
reader  ignorant  of  mythology.  Milton  abounds  in  similar  allu- 
sions. The  short  poem  Comus  contains  more  than  thirty  such, 
and  the  ode  On  the  Morning  of  the  Nativity  half  as  many. 
Through  Paradise  Lost  they  are  scattered  profusely.  This  is  one 
reason  why  we  often  hear  persons  by  no  means  illiterate  say  that 
they  cannot  enjoy  Milton,     But  were  these  persons  to  add  tc

their  more  solid  acquirements  the  easy  learning  of  this  little 
volume,  much  of  the  poetry  of  Milton  which  has  appeared  to 
them  harsh  and  crabbed  would  be  found  musical  as  is  Apollo's 
lute.  Our  citations,  taken  from  more  than  twenty-five  poets, 
from  Spenser  to  Longfellow,  will  show  how  general  has  been  the 
practice  of  borrowing  illustrations  from  mythology. 

The  prose  writers  also  avail  themselves  of  the  same  source  of 
elegant  and  suggestive  illustration. 

But  how  is  mythology  to  be  taught  to  one  who  does  not  learn 
it  through  the  medium  of  the  languages  of  Greece  and  Rome  ? 
To  devote  study  to  a  species  of  learning  which  relates  wholly  to 
false  marvels  and  obsolete  faiths  is  not  to  be  expected  of  the 
general  reader  in  a  practical  age  like  this.  The  time  even  of 
the  young  is  claimed  by  so  many  sciences  of  facts  and  things 
that  little  can  be  spared  for  set  treatises  on  a  science  of  mere 
fancy. 

But  may  not  the  requisite  knowledge  of  the  subject  be  acquired 
by  reading  the  ancient  poets  in  translations?  We  reply,  the  field 
is  too  extensive  for  a  preparatory  course,  and  these  very  transla- 
tions require  some  previous  knowledge  of  the  subject  to  make 
them  intelligible. 

Our  book  is  an  attempt  to  solve  this  problem  by  telling  the 
stories  of  mythology  in  such  a  manner  as  to  make  them  a  source 
of  amusement.  We  have  endeavored  to  tell  them  correctly  ac- 
cording to  the  ancient  authorities,  so  that  when  the  reader  finds 
them  referred  to  he  may  not  be  at  a  loss  to  recognize  the  refer- 
ence. Thus  we  hope  to  teach  mythology  not  as  a  study,  but  as 
a  relaxation  from  study  ;  to  give  our  work  the  charm  of  a  story- 
book, yet  by  means  of  it  to  impart  a  knowledge  of  an  important 
branch  of  education. 

Most  of  the  classical  legends  in  this  book  are  derived  from 
Ovid  and  Virgil.  They  are  not  literally  translated,  for,  in  the 
author's  opinion,  poetry  translated  into  literal  prose  is  very  un- 
attractive reading.     Neither  are  they  in  verse,  as  well  for  other 


AUTHORS  PREFACE.  vii 

reasons  as  from  a  conviction  that  to  translate  faithfully  under  all 
the  embarrassments  of  rhyme  and  measure  is  impossible.  The 
attempt  has  been  made  to  tell  the  stories  in  prose,  preserving  so 
much  of  the  poetry  as  resides  in  the  thoughts  and  is  separable 
from  the  language  itself,  and  omitting  those  amplifications  which 
are  not  suited  to  the  altered  form. 

The  poetical  citations  so  freely  introduced  are  expected  to 
answer  several  valuable  purposes.  They  will  tend  to  fix  in  mem- 
ory the  leading  fact  of  each  story,  they  will  help  to  the  attainment 
of  a  correct  pronunciation  of  the  proper  names,  and  they  will 
enrich  the  memory  with  many  gems  of  poetry,  some  of  them 
such  as  are  most  frequently  quoted  or  alluded  to  in  reading  and 
conversation. 

Having  chosen  mythology  as  connected  with  literature  for  our 
province,  we  have  endeavored  to  omit  nothing  which  the  reader 
of  elegant  literature  is  likely  to  find  occasion  for.  Such  stories 
and  parts  of  stories  as  are  offensive  to  pure  taste  and  good  morals 
are  not  given.  But  such  stories  are  not  often  referred  to,  and  if 
they  occasionally  should  be,  the  English  reader  need  feel  no 
mortification  in  confessing  his  ignorance  of  them. 

Our  book  is  not  for  the  learned,  nor  for  the  theologian,  nor 
for  the  philosopher,  but  for  the  reader  of  English  literature,  of 
either  sex,  who  wishes  to  comprehend  the  allusions  so  frequently 
made  by  public  speakers,  lecturers,  essayists,  and  poets,  and 
those  which  occur  in  polite  conversation. 

We  trust  our  young  readers  will  find  it  a  source  of  entertain- 
ment ;  those  more  advanced,  a  useful  companion  in  their  reading  ; 
those  who  travel,  and  visit  museums  and  galleries  of  art,  an 
interpreter  of  paintings  and  sculptures ;  those  who  mingle  in 
cultivated  society,  a  key  to  allusions  which  are  occasionally  made  ; 
and,  last  of  all,  those  in  advanced  life,  pleasure  in  retracing  a 
path  of  literature  which  leads  them  back  to  the  days  of  their 
childhood,  and  revives  at  every  step  the  associations  of  the  morn- 
ing of  life. 


viii  A  UTHOB  S  PRE  FA  CE. 

The  permanency  of  those  associations  is  beautifully  expressed 
in  the  well-known  lines  of  Coleridge  : 

*•  The  intelligible  forms  of  ancient  poets, 
The  fair  humanities  of  old  religion, 
The  Power,  the  Beauty,  and  the  Majesty 
That  had  their  haunts  in  dale  or  piny  mountain. 
Or  forest,  by  slow  stream,  or  pebbly  spring, 
Or  chasms  and  watery  depths  ;  all  these  have  vanished , 
They  live  no  longer  in  the  faith  of  reason  ; 
But  still  the  heart  doth  need  a  language  ;  still 
Doth  the  old  instinct  bring  back  the  old  names. 
Spirits  or  gods  that  used  to  share  this  earth 
With  man  as  with  their  friend  ;  and  at  this  day 
'Tis  Jupiter  who  brings  whate'er  is  great 
And  Venus  who  brings  every  thing  that's  fair." 


EDITOR'S  PREFACE. 


Mythology  is  the  dust  of  former  beliefs.  It  is  man's  first 
effort  to  know  his  God.^  The  story  of  that  effort  this  book 
seeks  to  relate.  There  has  always  been  a  fascination  about  the 
"Age  of  Fable"  unequalled  by  any  similar  work.  It  was  first 
given  to  the  public  some  forty  years  ago,  but  time  has  failed  to 
lessen  the  appreciation  of  its  merit.  Mythology  itself  has 
undergone  marked  changes,  especially  on  its  philosophic  and 
comparative  sides ;  still  the  essential  story  remains  unsurpassed. 
The  simplicity  of  style  and  purpose  has  contributed  largely  to 
this  result.  By  connecting  mythology  with  literature,  the  age 
of  fable  became  the  one  of  fact.  Other  mythologists  were  content 
to  introduce  the  gods  to  each  other ;  Mr.  Bulfinch  sought  to 
make  them  acquainted  with  men.  In  this  he  succeeded,  and  an 
intimacy  was  formed  which  had  not  hitherto  existed.  He  also 
abandoned  the  conventional  manual  idea,  and  treated  mythology 
as  a  story.  The  difference  between  a  manual  and  consecutive 
history  is  the  difference  between  a  series  of  stagnant  pools  and 
a  running  stream.  In  the  latter  instance  one  is  carried  on  by 
the  force  of  the  current.  The  marked  changes,  however,  to 
which  we  have  referred  demand  a  newer  and  more  complete 
edition.  The  Pantheons  of  Greece  and  Rome  have  received  no 
important  accessions,  but  the  eastern  sky  is  resplendent  with  new 
stars.  There  has  been  a  resurrection  throughout  Egypt  and 
Babylon  which  has  entirely  transformed  the  mythologies  of  those 
countries.  This  we  have  sought  to  recognize  by  introducing  an 
entirely  new  Section  on  Babylon,  Assyria  and  Phoenicia.     We 

^^Mythologies  are  the  unaided  attempts  of  man  to  find  out  God.  They  are 
the  efforts  of  the  reason  struggling  to  know  the  Infinite. — D.  G.  Brinton,  7>4<?

have  also  rewritten  the  Chapters  on  Persia,  India,  Scandinavia 
and  the  Druids.  These  countries,  in  some  instances,  were  the 
sources  of  our  own  civiHzation,  and  ought  to  be  of  interest  to 
every  student. 

The  classical  feature  upon  which  Mr.  Bulfinch  laid  so  much 
stress  has  received  especial  attention.  The  most  liberal  extracts 
from  the  old  classics  are  to  be  found  in  almost  every  chapter. 
Such  names  as  Virgil,  Homer,  Euripides,  Sophocles  and  Ovid 
will  become  familiar  to  every  student. 

By  these  references  the  reader  will  obtain  at  least  a  suggestive 
knowledge  of  the  thoughts  and  themes  of  those  master  men. 
Their  worth  is  much,  if  they  do  nothing  more  than  serve  as 
guide -boards  to  the  more  spacious  fields  of  ancient  literature 

The  modern  poets  have  also  been  generous  in  their  contribu- 
tions. Mr.  Bulfinch,  in  his  first  edition,  made  **  citations  from 
twenty-five  poets,  ranging  from  Spenser  to  Longfellow."  But 
the  Muses  have  not  been  altogether  voiceless  for  the  last  half- 
century.  Our  readers,  on  their  journey  through,  will  meet 
writers  like  Edwin  Arnold,  Charles  A.  Swinburne  and  William 
Morris,  not  one  of  whom  would  have  been  recognized  as  a  poet 
forty  years  ago.  Apart  from  this  is  the  other  equally  important 
fact,  that  some  of  the  finest  legendary  poems  of  the  older  writers, 
such  as  Tennyson's  *'Tithonus,"  Longfellow's  **  Tales  of  a 
Wayside  Inn,"  and  Lowell's  *'  Prometheus,"  are  all  of  more 
recent  date.  Poetry  is  the  natural  language  of  all  mythology. 
The  Zend-Avesta,  Rig-Veda,  and  the  Eddas,  are  but  the  epics  of 
the  gods.  They  were  to  other  nations  what  the  Odyssey  and 
^neid  were  to  Greece  and  Rome.  From  these  various  sheaves 
we  have  selected  a  few  specimen -straws — enough,  perhaps,  to 
suggest  the  richness  of  the  harvest.  Our  illustrations  have  been 
selected  with  great  care,  and  we  hope  with  equal  judgment.  They 
are  mainly  reproductions  from  the  original  statues  and  paintings, 
thus  giving  a  picture  of  the  idea  as  it  actually  existed  in  the 
ancient  mind.     The  purpose  of  their  insertion  is  not  only  tg

beautify  the  pages,  but  also  to  interpret  their  thought.  Apart 
from  this,  they  form  collectively  a  complete  handbook  of  iVi/tho- 
logical  art. 

One  of  the  chief  difficulties  in  the  study  of  mythology  is  the 
uncertainty  attached  to  the  pronunciation  of  the  proper  names. 
True,  there  are  rules  of  pronunciation,  often  more  abstruse  than 
the  words  themselves.  The  dictionary  may  or  may  not  be  acces- 
sible, but  too  frequent  a  reference  tends  to  break  off  continuity 
of  interest,  thus  rendering  study  an  irksome  task.  The  result  is, 
mythology  under  these  conditions  is  liable  to  be  laid  aside  as 
something  devoid  of  charm  or  interest.  This  obstacle  we  have 
sought  to  remove  by  giving  each  name,  as  it  appears  at  the  head 
of  the  chapter,  its  proper  pronunciation ;  also  the  first  time  it 
appears  in  the  body  of  the  text.  For  this  we  predict  the  grati- 
tude of  every  student  of  mythology.  Too  much  importance 
cannot  be  attached  to  this  feature  of  our  edition. 

To  know  the  name  is  often  to  know  the  thing,  especially  in 
mythology,  where  names  constitute  being.  We  introduce  every 
divinity  by  his  proper  name,  and  so  distinctly  that  the  student 
understands  it  from  the  first.  One  is  not  compelled  to  search  the 
vocabularies,  and  return  perhaps  without  the  knowledge ;  his 
introduction  is  sufficient.  In  doing  this  we  have  attempted  to 
recognize  the  nationality  of  every  god.  Thus  Jupiter  is  from 
Rome  and  Zeus  from  Olympus.  With  this  modern  Hellenistic 
idea,  by  which  Rome  becom.es  a  suburb  to  Athens,  we  confess  to 
no  sympathy.  There  is  an  affinity  between  the  name  and  the 
god  which  amounts  to  identity  of  being.  Thus  the  name  of 
Jupiter  is  essential  to  his  existence  ;  as  Zeus  he  ceases  to  be.  A 
rose  by  another  name  may  remain  unchanged,  but  a  god  cannot. 
Our  solar  system,  we  suppose,  would  suffer  no  change,  although 
Jupiter  were  known  among  the  planets  as  Zeus,  Venus  as  Aphro- 
dite, and  Mercury  as  Hermes.  Behind  those  names  stand  real 
worlds ;  not  so  in  mythology.  There  the  name  is  but  the  visible 
shadow  of  an  invisible  idea. 


xii  EDITOR  S  PREFA  CE. 

There  is  no  law  more  positive  than  that  of  custom.  Name 
and  character  become  inseparable.  Thus  Vulcan,  as  Hephaestus, 
is  no  longer  the  *' crippled  artizan  god,*' — the  good-natured, 
genial  fellow  who  toils  away  without  complaint, — but  a  social 
gentleman.  The  name  of  Vulcan  is  black  with  the  dust  of  the 
forge ;  one  hears  the  ring  of  the  anvil  in  its  very  accent.  Not 
so  with  Hephaestus.  There  is,no  soot  on  his  face,  no  halt  in  his 
walk  ;  his  associates  are  Mercury,  Apollo  and  Jupiter.  We  have 
thus  sought  not  only  to  retain  the  names,  but  also  the  ideal  per- 
sonalities which  they  represent.  The  index  has  been  enlarged  to 
the  proportions  of  a  dictionary.  Whenever  an  important  divinity 
has  received  but  passing  notice  in  the  text,  we  have  supplemented 
the  fact  by  a  more  extended  account  in  the  lexicon.  In  so  doing 
we  have  quoted  from  Smith's  ''Classical  Dictionary"  to  such 
"an  extent  that  the  lexicon  may  be  regarded  as  a  compendium  of 
that  valuable  work.  Three  characteristics  would  seem  to  be  de- 
sirable in  a  complete  mythology — simple,  classic  and  compre- 
hensive. So  far  as  the  first  is  concerned,  the  verdict  of  forty 
years  is  not  liable  to  be  reversed.  As  for  the  remaining  two,  we 
can  only  trust  that  time  may  accord  us  that  degree  of  recognition 
we  have  striven  to  merit.  Whatever  Mr.  Bulfinch  wrote  remains 
largely  intact.  The  changes  introduced  are  incident  to  time 
and  circumstance. 

Our  purpose  has  been  to  prompt  rather  than  interrupt  these 
beautiful  stories  as  they  were  first  told  by  the  author,  forty  years 
ago.  J.  LouGHRAN  Scott.

STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES. 


CHAPTER  I. 


INTRODUCTION. 


Ancient  mythologies  have  much  to  do  with  modem  literature. 
As  religions,  they  belong  to  the  past.  The  so-called  divinities 
of  O-lym'pus  have  not  a  single  worshipper  among  living  men. 
Their  dominion  is  that  of  literature  and  taste.  The  school-room 
has  displaced  the  temple ;  and  here  the  gods  have  found  their 
immortality.  Our  own  language,  in  particular,  owes  much  to 
the  visionary  deities  of  extinct  theology.  Zeus,  Mi-ner'va 
and  A-pol'lo — these  are  among  our  literary  ancestors.  Many 
of  our  best -known  words  are  but  the  harvest  of  their  sowing. 
This  similarity  of  language  presupposes  an  origin  common  to  all. 
The  gods,  like  men,  were  related,  and  by  tracing  their  kinship 
we  arrive  at  a  more  perfect  knowledge  of  our  own,  Man  is 
always  found  in  company  with  some  god ;  left  to  himself,  he 
constructs  one  of  his  own.  The  most  extravagant  legends  are 
invented  and  given  locality.  The  forces  of  nature  become  sen- 
tient beings,  and  are  clothed  with  conscious  power.  Our  own 
feelings  take  upon  themselves  a  divine  personality,  and  these,  in 
the  light  of  subsequent  knowledge,  become  mythology.     In  order

STORIES  OF  OODS  AND  HEROES. 


to  understand  these  legends,  it  will  be  necessary  to  acquaint  our- 
selves with  the  ideas  of  the  structure  of  the  universe  which  pre- 
vailed among  the  Greeks — the  people  from  whom  the  Romaxia 

and  otht.r  nations  re- 
ceived much  of  their 
mythology.  They 
believed  the  earth  to 
be  flat  and  circular, 
their  own  country 
occupying  the  mid- 
dle of  it,  the  central 
point  being  either 
Mount  O-lym'pus, 
the  abode  of  the 
gods,  or  Del'phi,  so 
famous  for  its  oracle. 
The  circular  disk 
of  the  earth  was 
crossed  from  west  to 
east,  and  divided 
into  two  equal  parts 
by  the  Sea,  as  they 
called  the  Mediter- 
ranean, and  its  con- 
tinuation, the  Eux- 
ine. 

Around  the  earth 
flowed  the  J^iver 
Oceajty  its  course 
being  from  south  to 
north  on  the  western 
side  of  the  earth,  and 
in  a  contrary  direc- 
tion on  the  eastern 
side.  It  flowed  in  a 
steady,  equable  cur- 
rent, unvexed  by 
ftorm  or  tempest.  The  sea  and  all  the  rivers  on  earth  received 
their  waters  from  it. 


Jupiter  Verospl  (Vatican,  Rome). 


INTRODUCTION,  3 

The  northern  portion  of  the  earth  was  supposed  to  be  inhab- 
ited by  a  happy  race  named  the  Hyp-er-bo're  ans,  dwelling 
in  everlasting  bliss  and  spring  beyond  the  lofty  mountains  whose 
caverns  were  supposed  to  send  forth  the  piercing  blasts  of  the 
north  wind,  which  chilled  the  people  of  Hellas  (Greece).  Their 
country  was  inaccessible  by  land  or  sea.  They  lived  exempt 
fiom  disease  or  old  age,  from  toils  and  warfare.  Moore  has 
given  us  the  **Song  of  a  Hyperborean,"  beginning 

*•  I  come  from  a  land  in  the  sun-bright  deep. 
Where  golden  gardens  glow, 
Where  the  winds  of  the  north,  becalmed  in  sleep. 
Their  conch-shells  never  blow.'* 

On  the  south  side  of  the  earth,  close  to  the  stream  of  Ocean, 
dwelt  a  people  happy  and  virtuous  as  the  Hyperboreans.  They 
were  named  the  Ethiopians.  The  gods  favored  them  so  highly 
that  they  were  wont  to  leave  at  times  their  Olympian  abodes, 
and  go  to  share  their  sacrifices  and  banquets. 

On  the  western  margin  of  the  earth,  by  the  stream  of  Ocean, 
lay  a  happy  place  named  the  E-lys'i-an  Plain,  whither  mortals 
favored  by  the  gods  were  transported  without  tasting  of  death, 
to  enjoy  an  immortality  of  bliss.  This  happy  region  was  also 
called  the  **  Fortunate  Fields  "  and  the  **  Isles  of  the  Blessed/* 

••  They  need  not  the  moon  in  that  land  of  delight. 
They  need  not  the  pale,  pale  star  ; 
The  sun  is  bright,  by  day  and  night. 
Where  the  souls  of  the  blessed  are. 

"  They  till  not  the  ground,  they  plow  not  the  wave. 
They  labor  not,  never !  oh,  never  f 
Not  a  tear  do  they  shed,  not  a  sigh  do  they  heave ; 
They  are  happy  for  ever  and  ever  I**— Pindar. 

We  thus  see  that  the  Greeks  of  the  early  ages  knew  little  of 
any  real  people  except  those  to  the  east  and  south  of  their  own 
country,  or  near  the  coast  of  the  Mediterranean.  Their  imagi- 
nation, meantime,  peopled  the  western  portion  of  this  sea  with 
giants,  monsters  and  enchantresses,  while  they  placed  around  the 
disk  of  the  earth,  which  they  probably  regarded  as  of  no  great

width,  nations  enjoying   the  peculiar  favor  of  the  gods,  and 
blessed  with  happiness  and  longevity. 

The  Dawn,  the  Sun  and  the  Moon  were  supposed  to  rise  ou( 
of  the  Ocean  on  the  eastern  side,  and  to  drive  through  the  air, 
giving  light  to  gods  and  men.  The  stars  also,  except  those  form- 
ing the  Wain  or  Bear,  and  others  near  them,  rose  out  of  and 
sank  into  the  stream  of  Ocean.  There  the  sun -god  embarked 
.n  a  winged  boat,  which  conveyed  him  round  by  the  northern 
part  of  the  earth,  back  to  his  place  of  rising  in  the  east.  Milton 
aPudes  to  this  in  his  "  Comus.** 

••  Now  the  gilded  car  of  day 
His  golden  axle  doth  allay 
In  the  steep  Atlantic  stream, 
And  the  slope  Sun  his  upward  beam 
Shoots  against  the  dusky  pole,  ' 

Pacing  towards  the  other  goal 
Of  his  chamber  in  the  east." 

The  abode  of  the  gods  was  on  the  summit  of  Mount  0-lym'- 
pus ,  in  Thessaly.  A  gate  of  clouds,  kept  by  the  goddesses  named 
the  Seasons,  opened  to  permit  the  passage  of  the  Celestials  to 
earth,  and  to  receive  them  on  their  return.  The  gods  had  their 
separate  dwellings;  but  all,  when  summoned,  repaired  to  the 
palace  of  Ju'pi-ter,  as  did  also  those  deities  whose  usual  abode 
was  the  earth,  the  waters  or  the  underworld.  It  was  also  in  the 
great  hall  of  the  palace  of  the  Olympian  king  that  the  gods 
feasted  each  day  on  ambrosia  and  nectar,  their  food  and  drink, 
the  latter  being  handed  round  by  the  lovely  goddess  He'be. 
Here  they  conversed  of  the  affairs  of  heaven  and  earth ;  and  as 
they  quaffed  their  nectar,  A-pol'lo,  the  god  of  music,  delighted 
them  with  the  tones  of  his  lyre,  to  which  the  Muses  sang  in  re- 
sponsive strains.  When  the  sun  was  set,  the  gods  retired  ta 
sleep  in  their  respective  dwellings. 

The  following  lines  from  the  "Odyssey"  will  show  how 
Horaer  conceived  of  Olympus : 

**  So  saying,  Mi-ner'va,  goddess  azure-eyed.

in  Olympus.  He  built  of  brass  the  houses  of  the  gods ;  he 
made  for  them  the  golden  shoes  with  which  they  trod  tlie  air  oi 
the  water,  and  moved  from  place  to  place  with  the  speed  of  the 
wind,  or  even  of  thought.  He  also  shod  with  brass  the  celestial 
iteeds  which  whirled  the  chariots  of  the  gods  through  the  air  O) 
along  the  surface  of  the  sea.  He  was  able  to  bestow  on  hi* 
workmanship  self-motion,  so  that  the  tripods  (chairs  and  tablesj 
could  move  of  themselves  in  and  out  of  the  celestial  hall.

Ju'pi-ter,  or  Jove  (Zeus^),  though  called  the  father  of  godi 
and  men,  had  himself  a  beginning.  Sat'urn  (Cro'nus) 
was  his  father,  and  Rhe'ft  (Ops)  his  mother.  Saturn  and 
Rhea  were  of  the  race  of  Ti'tans,  who  were  the  children  »/ 


Cronus  and  Khea  (Naples). 

Earth  and  Heaven,  which  sprang  from  Cha'os,  of  which  we 
shall  give  a  further  account  in  our  next  chapter. 

Saturn  and  Rhea  were  not  the  only  Titans.  There  were 
others,  whose  names  were  O-ce'a-nus,  Hy-pe'ri-on,  I-ap'e- 
tus  and  O-phi'on,  males;   and  The'mis,  Mne-mos'y-ne, 

'  The  names  included  in  parentheses  are  the  Greek,  the  others  being  tb« 
Roman  or  Latin  names.

Eu-ryn'O-me,  females.  They  are  spoken  of  as  the  elder  gods, 
whose  dominion  was  afterwards  transferred  to  others.  Saturn 
yielded  to  Jupiter,  Oceanus  to  Neptune,  Hyperion  to  Apollo. 
Hyperion  was  the  father  of  the  Sun,  Moon  and  Dawn.  He  is 
therefore  the  original  sun -god,  and  is  painted  with  the  splendor 
and  beauty  which  were  afterwards  bestowed  on  Apollo. 

**  Hyperion's  curls,  the  front  of  Jove  himself." — Shakspeare. 

Ophion  and  Eurynome  ruled  over  Olympus  till  they  wera 
dethroned  by  Saturn  and  Rhea.  Milton  alludes  to  them  in 
*'  Paradise  Lost."  He  says  the  heathens  seem  to  have  had  some 
knowledge  of  the  temptation  and  fall  of  man, 

**  And  fabled  how  the  serpent,  whom  they  called 
Ophion,  with  Eurynome  (the  wide- 
Encroaching  Eve  perhaps),  had  first  the  rule 
Of  high  Olympus,  thence  by  Saturn  driven." 

The  representations  given  of  Sat'urn  are  not  very  consistent, 
for  on  the  one  hand  his  reign  is  said  to  have  been  the  golden  age 
of  innocence  and  purity,  and  on  the  other  he  is  described  as  a 
monster  who  devoured  his  own  children.^  Jupiter,  however, 
escaped  this  fate,  and  when  grown  up  espoused  Me'tis  (Pru- 
dence), who  administered  a  draught  to  Saturn  which  caused  him 
to  disgorge  his  children.  Jupiter,  with  his  brothers  and  sisters, 
now  rebelled  against  their  father  Saturn,  and  his  brothers,  the  Ti- 
tans ;  vanquished  them,  and  imprisoned  some  of  them  in  Tar'- 
ta-rus,  inflicting  other  penalties  on  others.  At'las  was  con- 
demned to  bear  up  the  heavens  on  his  shoulders. 

On  the  dethronement  of  Saturn,  Jupiter  with  his  brothers 
Nep'tune  (Po-sei'don)  and  Plu'to  (Dis)  divided  his  do«» 
minions.  Jupiter's  portion  was  tjie  heavens,  Neptune's  thd 
ocean,  and  Pluto's  the  realms  of  the  dead. 

•*  Pluto,  the  grisly  god,  who  never  spares, 

Who  feels  no  mercy,  who  hears  no  prayers." — HoMER. 

*  This  inconsistency  arises  from  considering  the  Saturn  of  the  Romans  th« 
same  with  the  Grecian  deity  Cronos  (Time),  which,  as  it  brings  an  end  to  all 
things  which  have  had  a  beginainp   may  be  said  to  devour  its  own  oflsprmg. 


STOBIES  OF  GODS  ANI^  HEROES. 


Earth  and  Olympus  were  common  property.  Jupiter  wa* 
king  of  gods  and  men.  The  thunder  was  his  weapon,  and  he 
bore  a  shield  called  JE.'giSy  made  for  him  by  Vulcan.  The 
eagle  was  his  favorite  bird,  and  bore  his  thunderbolts. 

Ju'no  (He'ra)  was  thf 
wife  of  Jupiter,  and  queen  of 
the  gods.  Iris,  the  goddess 
of  the  rainbow,  was  her  at- 
tendant and  messenger.  The 
peacock  was  her  favorite 
bird. 

Vul'can(He-phaes'tus), 
the  celestial  artist,  was  the 
son  of  Jupiter  and  Juno.  He 
was  born  lame,  and  his  mother 
was  so  displeased  at  the  sight 
of  him  that  she  flung  him  out 
of  heaven.  Other  accounts 
say  that  Ju'pi  ter  kicked  him 
out  for  taking  part  with  his 
mother  in  a  quarrel  which  oc- 
curred between  them.  Vul'- 
can's  lameness,  according  to 
this  account,  was  the  conse- 
quence of  his  fall.  He  was 
a  whole  day  falling,  and  at 
last  alighted  in  the  Island  of 

Juno,  or  Hera.     (Vatican,  Rome.)       Lem'nOS,  which  waS  thence- 

,       forth  sacred  to  him.     Milton 
alludes  to  this  story  in  **  Paradise  Lost,'*  Book  I. 


**  From  morn 
To  noon  he  fell,  from  noon  to  dewy  eve, 
A  summer's  day  ;  and  with  the  setting  sun 
Dropped  from  the  zenith,  like  a  falling  star. 
On  Lemnos,  the  .'Egean  isle." 

Mars  (A'res),  the  god  of  war,  was  the  son  of  Jupiter  and 
Juno. 
Phoe'bus  A  poi'lo,  the    god  of    archery,    prophecy  and 


INTRODUCTION-,  ^ 

[pwsic,  was  the  son  of  Jupiter  and  Latona,  and  brother  of  Di. 
a'na  (Ar'te-mis).  He  was  god  of  the  sun,  as  Diana,  his  sis- 
ter, was  the  goddess  of  the  moon. 

Ve'nus  (Aph-ro-di'te),  the  goddess  of  love  and  beauty, 
was  the  daughter  of  Jupiter  and  Di-o'ne.  Others  say  that 
Venus  sprang  from  the  foam  of  the  sea.  The  zephyr  wafted 
her  along  the  waves  to  the  Isle  of  Cyprus,  where  she  was  re- 
ceived and  attired  by  the  Seasons,  and  then  led  to  the  assembly 
:)f  the  i::ods.  All  were  charmed  w*th  her  beauty,  and  each  one

gratitude  for  the  service  he  had  rendered  in  forging  thunder- 
bolts. So  the  most  beautiful  of  the  goddesses  became  the  wife 
of  the  most  ill-favored  of  the  gods.  Ve'nus  possessed  an  em-

love.  Her  favorite  birds  were  swans  and  doves,  and  the  plants 
sacred  to  her  were  the  rose  and  the  myrtle. 

Cu'pid  (E'ros),  the  god  of  love,  was  the  son  of  Venus.  He 
was  her  constant  companion,  and,  armed  with  bow  and  arrows, 
he  shot  the  darts  of  desire  into  the  bosoms  of  both  gods 
and  men.  There  was  a  deity  named  An'te-ros,  who  was 
sometimes  represented  --^z  the  avenger  of  slighted  love,  and  some-

times  as  the  symbol   of  reciprocal  affection.      The   following 
legend  is  told  of  him  : — 

Ve'nus,  complaining  to  The'mis  that  her  son  Eros  continued 
always  a  child,  was  told  by  her  that  it  was  because  he  was  solitary, 
and  that  if  he  had  a  brother  he  would  grow  apace.  Anterof 
was  born  soon  afterwards,  and  Eros  immediately  was  seen  tQ 
increase  rapidly  in  size  and  strength.

Mi-ner'va  (Pal'las  A-the-'ne),  the  goddess  of  wisdom,

the  owl,  and  the  plant  sacred  to  her  the  olive.

Mer'cu-ry  (Her'mes)  was  the  son  of  Jupiter  and  Ma'ia 
He  presided  over  commerce,  wrestling  and  other  gymnastic  exer 
cises,  even  over  thiev- 
ing, and  everything,  in 
short,  which  required 
skill  and  dexterity.  He 
was  the  messenger  of  Ju- 
piter, and  wore  a  winged 
cap  and  winged  shoes. 
He  bore  in  hie  hand  a 
rod  entwined  with  two 
serpents,  called  the  Ca- 
duceus. 

Mercury  is  said  to

instrument  was  complete.  The  cords  were  nine,  in  honor  of 
the  nine  Muses.  Mercury  gave  the  lyre  to  Apollo,  and  received 
from  him  in  exchange  the  caduceus.* 

•  From  this  origin  of  the  instrument,  the  word  **  shell "  is  often  used  at

Ce'res  (De-me'ter)  was  the  daughter  of  Saturn  and  Rhea, 
She  had  a  daughter  named  Pro-ser'pi-ne  (Per-seph'o-ne), 

who  became  the  wife  of  Pluto,  and  queen  of  the  reahns  of  the 

dead.     Ceres  presided  over  agriculture. 

Bac'chus  (Di  o-nys'us),  the  god  of  wine,  was  the  son  of 

Jupiter  and  Sem'e-le.     He  represents  not  only  the  intoxicating 

power  of  wine,  but  its  social 
and  beneficent  influences 
likewise,  so  that  he  is  viewed 
as  the  promoter  of  civiliza- 
tion, and  a  lawgiver  and 
lover  of  peace. 

The  Mu'ses  were  the 
daughters  of  Jupiter  and 
Mne-mos'y-ne  (Mem- 
ory). They  presided  over 
song  and  prompted  the 
memory.  They  were  nine 
in  number,  to  each  of  whom 
was  assigned  the  presidence 
over  some  particular  depart 
ment  of  literature,  art  or  sci- 
ence. Cal-li'o-pe  was  'he 
muse  of  epic  poetry,  Cli'c 
of  history,  Eu-ter'pe  of  ly- 
ric poetry,  Mel-pom'e-ne 
of  tragedy,Terp-sich'o-re

The  Graces  were  goddesses  presiding  over  the  banquet,  the 

dance,  and  all  social  enjoyments  and  elegant  arts.     They  were 

three  in  number.      Their  names  were  Eu-phros'y-ne,   Ag- 

la'ia  and  Tha-li'a. 

Spenser  describes  the  office  of  the  Graces  thus  :■—

As  comely  carriage,  entertainment  kind, 
Sweet  semblance,  friendly  offices  that  bind. 
And  all  the  complements  of  courtesy  ; 
They  teach  us  how  to  each  degree  and  kind 
We  should  ourselves  demean,  to  low,  to  high, 
To  friends,  to  foes  ;  which  skill  men  call  Civility." 

The  Fates  were  also  three — Clo'tho,  Lach'e-sis  and  At' 
ro-pos.  Their  office  was 
to  spin  the  thread  of  human 
destiny,  and  they  were 
armed  with  s  h  e  ar  s,  with 
which  they  cut  it  off  when 
they  pleased.  They  were 
the  daughters  of  The'mis 
(Law),  who  sits  by  Jove 
on  his  throne  to  give  him 
counsel. 

The  E-rin'ny-es,orFu'- 
ries,  were  three  goddesses 
who  punished  by  their  secret 
stings  the  crimes  of  those 
who  escaped  or  defied  public 
justice.  The  heads  of  the 
Furies  were  wreathed  with 
serpents,  and  their  whole 
appearance  was  terrific  and 
appalling.  Their  names  were 
A-lec'to,  Ti-siph'o-ne 
and  Me-gae'ra.  They  were 
also  called  Eu-men'i-des. 

Nem'e-sis  was  also  an 
avenging  goddess.  She  rep- 
resents the  righteous  anger 
of  the  gods,  particularly  towards  the  proud  and  insolent. 

Pan  was  the  god  of  flocks  and  shepherds.  His  favorite  resi« 
dence  was  in  Arcadia. 

The  Sa'tyrs  were  deities  of  the  woods  and  fields.  They  were 
conceived  to  be  covered  with  bristly  hair,  their  heads  decorated 
with  short,  sprouting  hornsj  and  their  feet  like  goats*  feet.

The  preceding  are  Grecian  divinities,  though  received  also  by 
the  Romans.  They  bear  the  color  and  form  of  Grecian  thought. 
But  the  Greeks  and  Romans  were  yet  to  meet  and  exchange  di- 
vinities.    This  they  did,  and  in  a  single  pantheon  built  an  altar

common  to  both.  It  was  a  peculiar  service,  and  one  which  has 
much  to  do  with  modern  literature.  The  Greeks  were  the  more 
poetic,  hence  they  became  the  song-writers  of  ancient  mythology. 
Rome  had  a  religion,  but  no  mythology.  Her  people  wor- 
shipped the  memory  of  their  ancestors,  and  seemed  to  care  for 
little  else.  Their  gods  were  largely  abstractions,  while  those  of 
Greece  were  definite  personalities.     As  a  result,  Greece  gave

and  their  gods  are  often  mistaken  one  for  the  other.  It  ought 
to  be  remembered,  however,  that  both  the  Greeks  and  Romans 
had  gods  peculiar  to  themselves.*  Zeus  and  Jupiter  retained 
their  own  distinctive  characteristics  long  after  they  were  thought 
to  be  identical.*

during  what  was  called  the  Golden  Age.  In  memory  of  his  be 
neficent  dominion,  the  feast  of  Saturnalia  was  held  every  year  in 
Ihe  winter  season.  Then  all  public  business  was  suspended, 
declarations  of  war  and  criminal  executions  were  postponed, 
friends  made  presents  to  one  another,  and  the  slaves  were  in- 
dulged with  great  liberties.  A  feast  was  given  them,  at  which 
i:hey  sat  at  table,  while  their  masters  served  them,  to  show  thf 
natural  equality  of  men,  and  that  all  things  belonged  equally  to 
all  in  the  reign  of  Saturn. 

Fau'nus,'  the  grandson  of  Saturn,  was  worshipped  as  the  god 

of  fields  and  shepherds,  and  also  as  a  pro- 
phetic god.  His  name  in  the  plural,  Fauns, 
expressed  a  class  of  gamesome  deities,  likf 
the  Satyrs  of  the  Greeks. 

Qui-ri'nus  was  a  war  god,  said  to  be  no 
other  than  Romulus,  the  founder  of  Rome, 
exalted  after  his  death  to  a  place  among 
the  gods. 

Bel-lo'na,  a  war  goddess. 
Ter'mi-nus,  the  god  of  landmarks.    Hia 
statue  was  a  rude  stone  or  post,  set  in  the 
ground  to  mark  the  boundaries  of  fields. 

Pa'les,  the  goddess  presiding  over  cattle 
and  pastures. 

Po-mo'na  presided  over  fruit  trees. 
Flo'ra,  the  goddess  of  flowers. 
Lu-ci'na,  the  goddess  of  childbirth. 
Ves'ta  (the   Hes'ti-a  of  the  Greeks) 
was  a  deity  presiding  over  the  public  and 
private  hearth.     A  sacred  fire,  tended  by 
six  virgin  priestesses  called  Vestals,  flamed 
in  her  temples.     As  the  safety  of  the  city  was  held  to  be  con-: 
nected  with  its  conservation,  the  neglect  of  the  virgins,  if  they 
let  it  go  out,  was  severely  punished,  and  the  fire  was  rekindled 
from  the  rays  of  the  sun.

INTRODUCTIOS,

Ja'nus  was  the  porter  of  heaven.     He  opens  the  year,  the 
first  month  being  named  after  him. 

•'  I  count 
The  years  that  through  my  portals  come  and  go.'* — LongfelloW. 

He  is  the  guardian  deity  of  gates,  on  which  account  he  is  com- 
monly represented  with  two  heads,  because  every  door  looks  two 
ways.  His  temples  at  Rome 
were  numerous.  In  war  time  the 
gates  of  the  principal  one  were 
always  open.  In  peace  they 
were  closed ;  but  they  were  shut 
only  once  between  the  reign  of 
Numa  and  that  of  Augustus. 

The  P  e  -  n  a' t  e  s  were  the 
gods  who  were  supposed  to  at- 
tend to  the  welfare  and  pros- 
perity of  the  family.  Their 
name  is  derived  from  Penus, 
the  pantry,  which  was  sacred  to 
them.  Every  master  of  a  family 
was  the  priest  to  the  Penates 
of  his  own  house. 

The  La'res,  or  Lars,  were 
also  household  gods,  but  dif- 
ered  from  the  Penates  in  being 
regarded  as  the  deified  spirits 
of  mortals.  The  family  Lars 
were  held  to  be  the  souls  of  the 
ancestors,  who  watched  over 
and  protected  their  descend- 
ants. The  words  Lemur  and 
Larva  more  nearly  correspond  to  our  word  Ghost. 

The  Romans  believed  that  every  man  had  his  Genius,  and 
every  woman  her  Ju'no ;  that,  is,  a  spirit  who  had  given  them 
being,  and  was  regarded  as  their  protector  through  life.  On 
their  birthdays  men  made  offerings  to  their  Genius,  women  to 
their  Juno. 

Macaulay  thus  alludes  to  some  of  the  Roman  gods :— •

The  gods  were  classified  as  higher  or  lower  according  to 
trtieir  rank.  The  higher  order  moved  in  the  region  of  air  above 
the  clouds.  At  times  they  assembled  on  the  summit  of  Olympus 
for  consultation ;  for  which  reason  they  were  known  as  the  Olym- 
pian gods.  These  were  twelve  in  number :  Ju'pi-ter  (Zeus), 
Ju'no  (He'ra),  Nep'tune  (Po-sei-don),  Ceres  (De-me'- 
ter),  A-pono,  Di-a'na  (Ar'te-mis),  Vul'can  (He-phaes-

nus  (Aph-ro-di'te),  Mer'cu-ry  (Her'mes),  and  Ves'ta. 

The  inferior  gods  lived  far  below  and  in  mansions  like  to 
earthly  princes.  Some  of  them  were  restricted  to  certain  locali- 
ties of  earth,  such  as  the  Ne-re'i-des  to  fountains,  the  O-re'- 
a-des  to  the  hills,  and  the  Dry'a-des  to  the  trees. 

Demigods, 

The  dem'i-gods,  as  the  name  implies,  were  but  half-deities. 
They  were  the  offspring  of  a  god  and  a  mortal.  When  the  mor- 
tal died  the  immortal  was  received  among  the  gods.

CHAPTER  II. 
Pro-me'theus  and  Pan-do'ra. 

The  origin  of  the  world  was  naturally  one  of  the  first  ques- 
tions to  excite  the  interest  of  man.  The  ancients,  having  no 
revelation,  were  obliged  to  tell  the  story  in  their  own  way, 
which  was  as  follows  :* 

Before  earth  and  sea  and  heaven  were  created,  all  things  wore 
one  aspect,  to  which  we  give  the  name  of  Chaos. 

"  Ere  earth  and  sea  and  covering  heavens  were  known, 
The  face  of  nature,  o'er  the  world,  was  one  ; 
And  men  have  call'd  it  Chaos." — OviD  (Elton's  tr.). 

Earth,  sea  and  air  were  all  blended  together.  The  earth  was 
not  solid,  the  sea  was  not  fluid,  and  the  air  was  not  transparent. 

••  No  sun  yet  beam'd  from  yon  cerulean  height ; 

No  orbing  moon  repiair'd  her  horns  of  light ;  i 

No  earth,  self-poised,  on  liquid  ether  hung; 

No  sea  its  world-enclasping  waters  flung." — OviD  (Elton's  tr. ), 

*  There  are  many  legends  as  to  the  earth's  creation  One,  the  **  Egg 
Myth,"  was  quite  generally  accepted.  Er'^e-bus,  the  god  of  darkness,  and 
Nox,  the  goddess  of  night,  produced  an  egg,  from  which  emerged  E^'ros,  the 
god  of  Love,  to  create  the  earth,  A  similar  legend,  related  by  Mesiod,  makes 
E'ros  the  child  of  Cha''os.  Being  the  god  of  T.ove,  he  induced  U'ra-nus,  the 
Heaven,  to  marry  Gse'a,  the  Earth,  whose  children  became  the  Ti'tans,  the 
original  creators  of  man.

20  STORIES  OF  QODS  AND  HEROES, 

God  and  Nature  at  last  interposed  and  put  an  end  to  this  dis- 
cord, separating  earth  from  sea  and  heaven  from  both.  The 
fiery  part,  being  the  lightest,  sprang  up  and  formed  the  skies ; 
the  air  was  next  in  weight  and  place.  The  earth,  being  heavier, 
sank  below,  and  the  water  took  the  lowest  place,  and  buoyed  up 
the  earth. 

Here  some  god — it  is  not  known  who — gave  his  good  offices 
In  arranging  and  disposing  the  earth.  He  gave  to  the  rivers 
and  bays  their  places,  raised  mountains,  excavated  valleys,  dis- 
tributed woods,  fountains,  fertile  fields  and  stony  plains.  The 
air  being  cleared,  the  stars  began  to  appear,  fishes  took  posses- 
sion of  the  sea,  birds  of  the  air,  and  four-footed  beasts  of  the 
land. 

But  a  nobler  animal  was  wanted,  and  Man  was  made.  It  is 
not  known  whether  the  Creator  made  him  of  divine  materials,  or 
whether  in  the  earth,  so  lately  separated  from  heaven,  there 
lurked  still  some  heavenly  seeds.  Prometheus  took  some  of  this 
earth,  and  kneading  it  up  with  water,  made  man  in  the  image  of 
the  gods. 

**  Prometheus  first  transmuted 
Atoms  culled  for  himiaa  clay."— Horace. 

He  gave  him  an  upright  stature,  so  that  while  all  other  ani- 
mals turn  their  faces  downward  and  look  to  the  earth,  he  raises 
his  face  toward  heaven  and  gazes  upon  the  stars. 

Pro-me'theus  was  one  of  the  Titans,  a  gigantic  race  who 
inhabited  the  earth  before  the  creation  of  man.  To  him  and  his 
brother  Epimetheus  was  committed  the  office  of  making  man, 
and  providing  him  and  all  other  animals  with  the  ficulties  neces- 
sary for  their  preservation.  Epimetheus  undertook  to  do  this, 
and  Prometheus  was  to  overlook  his  work.  Epimetheus  accord- 
ingly proceeded  to  bestow  upon  the  different  animals  the  various 
gifts  of  courage,  strength,  swiftness,  sagacity ;  wings  to  one, 
claws  to  another,  a  shelly  covering  to  a  third,  etc.  But  when 
man  came  to  be  provided  for,  who  was  to  be  superior  to  all  other 
animals,  Epimetheus  had  been  so  prodigal  of  his  resources  that 
he  had  nothing  left  to  bestow  upon  him.  In  his  perplexity  he 
resorted  to  his  brother,  Prometheus,  who,  with  the  aid  of  Mi- 
nerva, went  up  to  heaven  and  lighted  his  torch  sX  the  chariot 
of  the  sun  and  brought  down  fire  to  man. 


PROMETUE  US  AND  PANDORA.  2 1 

With  the  gift  of  fire  came  man's  dominion  over  the  earth. 
The  beasts  were  his  enemy,  but  fire  enabled  man  to  forge  weapons 
and  overcome  tliem.  ^\^ith  fire  he  warmed  his  dwelling,  and 
thus  beaime  an  inhabitant  of  every  clime.  AVith  it  he  also  in- 
troduced the  arts,  coined  money,  and  brought  about  the  possi- 
bilities of  trade. 

Woman  was  not  yet  made.  The  story  (absurd  enough!)  is 
that  Jupiter  beholding  from  his  throne  on  Olympus  a  strange 
fire  upon  the  earth,  asked  what  it  meant.  When  told,  his  rage 
knew  no  bounds.  The  gods  were  assembled  in  council,  and  it 
was  determined  that  woman  should  be  created,  and  sent  to  man 
as  a  punishment  for  accepting  Prometheus'  gift.  She  was  made 
in  heaven. 

"  The  crippled  artist-god, 
Illustrious,  molded  from  the  yielding  day 
A  bashful  virgin's  image,  as  ad  vis' d 
Saturnian  Jove." — Hesiod  (Elton's  tr.). 

The  gods  vied  with  each  other  in  contributing  their  gifts. 

Venus  gave  her  beauty.  Mercury  persuasion,  Apollo  music,  etc., 

because  of  which  she  was  named  Pan-do'ra.* 

Thus  equipped,  she  was  conveyed  to  earth  and  presented  to 

Epimetheus,  who  gladly  accepted  her,  though  cautioned  by  his 

brother  to  beware  of  Jupiter  and  his  gifts.     Epimetheus  had  ni 

his  house  a  jar,  in  which  were  kept  certain  noxious  articles,  for 

which,  in  fitting  man  for  his  new  abode,  he  had  had  no  occasion. 

Pandora  was  seized  with  an  eager  curiosity  to  know  what  thii 

jar  contained. 

**  Yon  mysterious  chest 
Attracts  and  fascinates  me.     Would  I  knew 
What  there  lies  hidden  I     But  the  oracle 
Forbids." — Masque  of  Pandora  (Longfellow). 

Pandora  was  not  equal  to  the  temptation.  One  day  she 
slipped  off  the  cover  and  looked  in.  Forthwith  there  escaped 
a  multitude  of  plagues  for  hapless  man, — such  as  gout,  rheuma- 
tism and  colic  for  his  body,  and  envy,  spite  and  revenge  for  his 
mind, — and  scattered  themselves  far  and  wide.  Pandora  hastened 
to  replace  the  lid,  but  alas  !  the  whole  contents  of  the  jar  had  es-

— Hesiod  (Elton*s  tr.). 

Another  story  is  that  Pandora  was  sent  in  good  faith,  by  Ju- 
piter, to  bless  man ; 
that  she  was  furnished 
with  a  box,  containing 
her  marriage  presents, 
into  which  every  god 
had  put  some  blessing. 
She  opened  the  box 
incautiously,  and  the 
blessings  all  escaped, 
hope  only  excepted. 
This  story  seems  more 
probable  than  the  for- 
mer ;  for  how  could 
hopey  so  precious  a. 
jewel  as  it  is,  have 
been  kept  in  a  jar  full 
of  all  manner  of  evils, 
as  in  the  former  state- 
ment ? 

The  world  being 
thus  furnished  with 
inhabitants,  the  first 
age  was  one  of  inno- 
cence and  happiness.

lifications  round  their  towns.  There  were  no  such  things  as 
swords,  spears,  or  hehiiets.  The  earth  brought  forth  all  mings 
necessary  for  man,  without  his  labor  in  ploughing  or  sowing. 
Perpetual  spring  reigned,  flowers  sprang  up  without  seed,  the 
rivers  flowed  with  milk  and  wine,  and  yellow  honey  distilled 
from  the  oaks. 

This  was  the  Golden  Age.     It  was  succeeded  by  the  Silver 
Age,  inferior  to  the  Golden,  but  better  than  those  that  followed. 

Jupiter  shortened  the  spring  and  divided  the  year  into  seasons 
Then,  first,  men  had  to  endure  the  extremes  of  heat  and  cold,  and 
houses  became  necessary.  Caves  were  the  first  dwellings,  and 
leafy  coverts  of  the  woods,  and  huts  woven  of  twigs.  Crops 
would  no  longer  grow  without  planting.  The  farmer  was  obliged 
to  sow  the  seed,  and  the  toiling  ox  to  draw  the  plough. 

"  Succeeding  times  a  silver  age  behold, 
Excelling  brass,  but  moreexcell'd  by  gold. 
Then  summer,  autumn,  winter,  did  appear. 
And  spring  was  but  a  season  of  the  year  ; 
The  sun  his  annual  course  obliquely  made. 
Good  days  contracted,  and  enlarg'd  the  bad. 
The  air  with  sultry  heats  began  to  glow, 
The  wings  cf  winds  were  clogg'd  with  ice  and  snow  ; 
And  shivering  mortals  into  houses  driven. 
Sought  shelter  from  the  inclemency  of  heaven. 
Those  houses,  then,  were  caves  or  homely  sheds. 
With  twining  osiers  fenc'd,  and  moss  their  beds. 
Then  plows,  for  seed,  the  fruitful  furrows  broke, 
And  oxen  labor' d  first  beneath  the  yoke." — Ovid  (Dryden's  tr.). 

The  Brazen  and  Iron  Ages  followed  in  rapid  succession.  Crime 
burst  in  like  a  flood ;  modesty,  truth,  and  honor  fled.  In  their 
places  came  fraud  and  cunning,  violence,  and  the  wicked  love 
of  gain.  Then  seamen  spread  sails  to  the  wind,  and  the  trees 
were  torn  from  the  mountains  to  serve  for  keels  to  ships  and  vex 
the  face  of  ocean.  The  earth,  which  till  now  had  been  culti- 
vated in  common,  began  to  be  divided  off  into  possessions.  Men 
were  not  satisfied  with  what  the  surface  produced,  but  must  dig 
into  its  bowels,  and  draw  forth  from  thence  the  ores  of  metals. 
Mischievous  iron,  and  more  mischievous  golii,  were  produced. 
War  sprang  up,  using  both  as  weapons  ;  the  guest  was  not  safe 
^n  his  fnend's  house  ;  and  sons-in-law  and  fathers-  in-law,  brothers 


24  STOBIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 

and  sisters,  husbands  and  wives,  could  not  trust  one  anothero 
Sons  wished  their  fathers  dead,  that  they  might  come  to  the  in- 
heritance ;  family  love  lay  prostrate.  The  earth  was  wet  with 
slaughter,  and  the  gods  abandoned  it,  one  by  one,  till  Astraea^ 
alone  was  left,  and  finally  she  also  took  her  departure. 

Jupiter,  seeing  this  state  of  things,  burned  with  anger.  He 
summoned  the  gods  to  council.  They  obeyed  the  call,  and  took 
'the  road  to  the  palace  of  heaven.  The  road,  which  any  one  may 
.see  in  a  clear  night,  stretches  across  the  face  of  the  sky,  and  is 
called  the  Milky  Way.  Along  the  road  stand  the  palaces  of  the 
illustrious  gods ;  the  common  people  of  the  skies  live  apart,  on 
either  side.  Jupiter  addressed  the  assembly.  He  set  forth  the 
frightful  condition  of  things  on  the  earth,  and  closed  by  an- 
nouncing his  intention  to  destroy  the  whole  of  its  inhabitants, 
and  provide  a  new  race,  unlike  the  first,  who  would  be  more 
worthy  of  life,  and  much  better  worshippers  of  the  gods.  So 
saying,  he  took  a  thunderbolt,  and  was  about  to  launch  it  at  the 
world,  and  destroy  it  by  burning  ;  but  recollecting  the  danger 
that  such  a  conflagration  might  set  heaven  itself  on  fire,  he 
changed  his  plan,  and  resolved  to  drown  it.  The  north  wind, 
which  scatters  the  clouds,  was  chained  up ;  the  south  was  sent 
out,  and  soon  covered  all  the  face  of  heaven  with  a  cloak  of 
pitchy  darkness.  The  clouds,  driven  together,  resounded  with 
a  crash ;  torrents  of  rain  fall ;  the  crops  are  laid  low ;  the  year's 
labor  of  the  husbandman  perishes  in  an  hour.  Jupiter,  not  satis- 
fied with  his  own  waters,  calls  on  his  brother  Neptune  to  aid  him 
with  his.     He  lets  loose  the  rivers,  and  pours  them  over  the 

'  The  goddess  of  innocence  and  purity.  After  leaving  earth,  she  was  placed 
among  the  stars,  where  she  became  the  constellation  Virgo — the  Virgin. 
Themis  (Justice)  was  the  mother  of  Astr?ea.  She  is  represented  as  holding 
aloft  a  pair  of  scales,  in  which  she  weighs  the  claims  of  opposing  parties. 

It  was  a  favorite  idea  of  the  old  poets  that  these  goddesses  would  one  day 
return,  and  bring  back  the  Golden  Age.  Even  in  a  Christian  Hymn,  the  Mes- 
giah  of  Pope,  this  idea  occurs. 

,  **  All  crimes  shall  cease,  and  ancient  fraud  shall  fail, 

Returning  Justice  lift  aloft  her  scale, 
Peace  o'er  the  world  her  olive  wand  extend, 
And  white-robed  Innocence  from  heaven  descend.'*

land.  At  the  same  time  he  heaves  the  land  with  an  earthquake, 
and  brings  in  the  reflux  of  the  ocean  over  the  shores.  Flocks, 
herds,  men  and  houses  are  swept  away,  and  temples  with  theit 
sacred  enclosures  profaned.  If  any  edifice  remained  standing 
it  was  overwhelmed,  and  its  turrets  lay  hid  beneaih  the  waves. 
Now  all  was  sea,  sea  without  shore.  Here  and  there  an  indi- 
vidual remained  on  a  projecting  hill-top,  and  a  few,  in  boats, 
pulled  the  oar  where  they  had  lately  driven  the  plough.  The 
jfishes  swim  among  the  tree-tops ;  the  anchor  is  let  down  into  a 
garden.  Where  the  graceful  lambs  played  but  now  unwieldy 
sea-calves  gambol.  The  wolf  swims  among  the  sheep,  the  yellow 
lions  and  tigers  struggle  in  the  water.  The  strength  of  the  wild 
boar  serves  him  not,  nor  his  swiftness  the  stag.  The  birds  fall 
with  weary  wing  into  the  water,  having  found  no  land  for  a  rest- 
ing-place. Those  living  beings  whom  the  water  spared  fell  a 
prey  to  hunger. 

•*  Now  hills  and  vales  no  more  distinction  know. 
And  level' d  nature  lies  oppress' d  below." — OviD  (Dryden*«  tr.), 

Parnassus  alone,  of  all  the  mountains,  overtopped  the  waves ; 
and  there  Deucalion  and  his  wife,  Pyrrha,  of  the  race  of  Prome- 
theus, found  refuge — he  a  just  man  and  she  a  faithful  worshipper  of 
the  gods.  Jupiter,  when  he  saw  none  left  alive  but  this  pair,  and 
remembered  their  harmless  lives  and  pious  demeanor,  ordered 
the  north  winds  to  drive  away  the  clouds,  and  disclose  the  skies 
to  earth  and  earth  to  the  skies.  Neptune  also  directed  Triton  to 
blow  on  his  shell  and  sound  a  retreat  to  the  waters.  The  waters 
obeyed,  and  the  sea  returned  to  its  shores  and  the  rivers  to  their 
channels. 

'*  At  length  the  world  was  all  restor'd  to  view, 
But  desolate,  and  of  a  sickly  hue  ; 
Nature  beheld  herself,  and  stood  aghast, 
A  dismal  desert  and  a  silent  waste." — OviD  (Dryden's  Ti. ). 

Then  Deucalion  thus  addressed  Pyrrha:  **0  wife,  only  surviving 
woman,  joined  to  me  first  by  the  ties  of  kindred  and  marriage, 
and  now  by  a  common  danger,  would  that  we  possessed  the  power 
of  our  ancestor  Prometheus,  and  could  renew  the  race  as  he  at 
firet  made  it !     But  as  we  cannot,  let  us  seek  yonder  temple,  and 


26  STORIES  OF  Q0D3  AND  HEBOE& 

inquire  of  the  gods  what  remains  for  us  to  do.**     They  entered 

the  temple,  deformed  as  it  was  with  slime,  and  approached  the 
altar,  where  no  fire  burned.  There  they  fell  prostrate  on  the 
earth,  and  prayed  the  goddess  to  inform  them  how  they  might 
retiieve  their  miserable  affairs.  The  oracle  answered,  **  Depart 
from  the  temple  with  head  veiled  and  garments  unbound,  and 
cast  behind  you  the  bones  of  your  mother. '  *  They  heard  the 
words  with  astonishment.  Pyrrha  first  broke  silence:  **We 
cannot  obey ;  we  dare  not  profane  the  remains  of  our  parents.  *  * 
rhey  sought  the  thickest  shades  of  the  wood,  and  revolved  the 
oracle  in  their  minds.  At  length  Deucalion  spoke:  ** Either 
my  sagacity  deceives  me,  or  the  command  is  one  we  may  obey 
without  impiety.  The  earth  is  the  great  parent  of  all ;  the  stones 
are  her  bones ;  these  we  may  cast  behind  us ;  and  I  think  this  is 
what  the  oracle  means.  At  least,  it  will  do  no  harm  to  try. ' ' 
They  veiled  their  faces,  unbound  their  garments,  and  picked  up 
stones,  and  cast  them  behind  them.  The  stones  (wonderful  to 
relate)  began  to  grow  soft  and  assume  shape.  By  degrees  they 
put  on  a  rude  resemblance  to  the  human  form,  likf  a  block  half- 
finished  in  the  hands  of  the  sculptor.  The  moisture  and  slime 
that  were  about  them  became  flesh ;  the  stony  part  became  bones ; 
the  veins  remained  veins,  retaining  their  name,  only  changing 
their  use.  Those  thrown  by  the  hand  of  the  man  became  men, 
and  those  by  the  woman  became  women.  It  was  a  hard  race, 
and  well  adapted  to  labor,  as  we  find  ourselves  to  be  at  this  day, 
giving  plain  indications  of  our  origin. 

Milton  thus  compares  Eve  to  Pandora,  changing  lapetus,  the 
ikther  of  Prometheus  and  Epimetheus,  to  Japhet : 

"More  lovely  than  Pandora,  whom  the  gods 
Endowed  with  all  their  gifts ;  and  O,  too  like 
In  sad  event,  when  to  the  unwiser  son 
Of  Japhet  brought  by  Hermes,  she  Insnared 
Mankind  by  her  fair  looks,  to  be  avenged 
On  him  who  had  stole  Joyc's  authentic  fire."

might  have  been  brought  to  an  end  at  any  time  by  Prometheus, 
if  he  had  been  willing  to  submit  to  his  oppressor ;  for  he  pos-

Prometheus  has  become  the  world's  symbol  of  sufTifci'ing  and 
strength  of  will  resisting  wrong. 

'*  Therefore,  gi-eat  heart,  bear  up  !     Thou  are  but  type 
Of  what  all  lofty  spirits  endure,  that  fain 
Would  win  men  back  to  strength  and  peace  through  love." 

— Lowell's  Prometheus. 

Lord  Byron  has  also  written  on  the  same  theme.     The  fol- 
lowing are  his  lines : 

**  Titan  !  to  whose  immortal  eyes 

The  sufferings  of  mortality, 

Seen  in  their  sad  reality, 
Were  not  as  things  that  gods  despise ; 
What  was  thy  pity' s  recompense  ? 
A  silent  suffering,  and  intense  ; 
Tlie  rock,  the  vulture  and  the  chain  ; 
All  that  the  proud  can  feel  of  pain  ; 
The  agony  they  do  not  show, 
The  suffocating  sense  of  woe."* 

*  The  poet  ^sdhylus,  who  lived  twenty-five  hundred  years  ago,  wrote  three 
tragedies  on  the  subject  of  Prometheus.  Unfortunately  but  one  Proindheui 
Chained  is  now  extant.  Vulcan,  after  much  hesitation,  chains  the  Titan  to  the 
rock.  He  is  visited  by  Mercury,  who  offers  release  on  condition  that  his  secret 
be  revealed.  There  are  many  very  excellent  English  translations.  The  i)oet

CHAPTER  III. 

Py'thon — A-porio  and  Daph'ne — Pyr'a-mus  and 
This'be — Ceph'a-lus  and  Proc'ris. 

The  slime  with  which  the  earth  was  covered  by  the  waters  of 
the  flood  produced  an  excessive  fertility  which  called  forth  every 
variety  of  production,  both  bad  and  good.  Among  the  rest, 
Py'thon,  an  enormous  serpent,  crept  forth,  the  terror  of  the 
people,  and  lurked  in  the  caves  of  Mount  Parnassus.  A-pQl'lo 
slew  him  with  his  arrows — weapons  which  he  had  not  before 
used  against  any  but  feeble  animals,  hares,  wild  goats,  and  such 
game.  In  commemoration  of  this  illustrious  conquest  he  insti- 
tuted the  Pythian  games,  in  which  the  victor  in  feats  of  strength, 
swiftness  of  foot,  or  in  the  chariot  race,  w^as  crowned  with  a 
wreath  of  beech  leaves,  for  the  laurel  was  not  yet  adopted  by 
Apollo  as  his  own  tree. 

At  the  entrance  to  one  of  these  mountain  caverns  was  situated 
the  Delphic  oracle,  the  most  famous  shrine  in  all  the  ancient 
world. 

Apollo  was  the  son  of  Jupiter  and  Latona.  Juno,  jealous  of 
his  mother,  banished  her  to  Delos,  a  rock  in  the  ^gean  sea. 
Here  was  born  Apollo  and  his  twin  sister  Diana.  The  two  seem 
to  have  centred  in  themselves  the  highest  ideal  of  their  country. 
Apollo  became  a  god  of  almost  universal  worship. 

**  I  am  the  eye  with  which  the  Universe 
Beholds  itself  and  knows  itself  divine. 
All  harmony  of  instrmnent  and  verse. 
All  prophecy,  all  medicine,  are  mine. 
All  light  of  art  or  nature ;  to  my  song 
Victory  and  praise  in  its  own  right  belong."

A-pol'lo  and  Daph'ne. 

Daph'ne  was  A-pol'lo's  first  love.  It  was  not  brought  about 
by  accident,  but  by  the  malice  of  Cupid.  Apollo  saw  the  boy 
playing  with  his  bow  and  arrows,  and  being  himself  elated  with 
his  recent  victory  over  Python,  he  said  to  him,  ''What  have 
you  to  do  with  warlike  weapons,  saucy  boy  ?  Leave  them  for 
hands  worthy  of  them.  Behold  the  conquest  I  have  won  by 
means  of  them  over  the  vast  serpent  who  stretched  his  poison- 
ous body  over  acres  of  the  plain  !  Be  content  with  your  torch, 
child,  and  kindle  up  your  flames,  as  you  call  them,  where  you 
will,  but  presume  not  to  meddle  with  my  weapons.** 

Venus' 3  boy  heard  these  words  and  rejoined,  **  Your  arrows 
may  strike  all  things  else,  Apollo,  but  mine  shall  strike  you." 
So  saying,  he  took  his  stand  on  a  rock  of  Parnassus,  and  drew 
from  his  quiver  two  arrows  of  different  workmanship,  one  to  ex- 
cite love,  the  other  to  repel  it.  The  former  was  of  gold  and 
sharp-pointed,  the  latter  blunt  and  tipped  with  lead.  With  the 
leaden  shaft  he  struck  the  nymph  Daphne,  the  daughter  of  the 
river  god  Peneus,  and  with  the  golden  one  Apollo,  through  the 
heart.  Forthwith  the  god  was  seized  with  love  for  the  maiden, 
while  she  abhorred  the  thought  of  loving.  Her  delight  was  in 
woodland  sports  and  in  the  spoils  of  the  chase.  Many  lovers 
sought  her,  but  she  spurned  them  all,  ranging  the  woods,  and 
taking  no  thought  of  Cupid  nor  of  Hymen.  Her  father  often 
said  to  her,  "  Daughter,  you  owe  me  a  son-in-law  ;  you  owe  me 
grandchildren."  She,  hating  the  thought  of  marriage  as  a 
crime,  with  her  beautiful  face  tinged  all  over  with  blushes,  threw 
her  arms  around  her  fithcr's  neck,  and  said,  **  Dearest  father, 
grant  me  this  favor,  that  I  may  always  remain  unmarried,  like 
Diana."  He  consented,  but  at  the  same  time  said,  **  Your  own 
face  will  forbid  it." 


APOLLO  A  ND  DA  PHNE.  3 1 

Apollo  loved  her,  and  longed  to  obtain  her  ;  but  he  who  gives 
oracles  to  all  the  world  was  not  wise  enough  to  look  into  his  ov;n 
fortunes.  He  saw  her  hair  flung  loose  over  her  shoulders,  and 
said,  **  If  so  charming  in  disorder,  what  would  it  be  if  arranged  ?' ' 
He  saw  her  eyes  bright  as  stars ;  he  saw  her  lips,  and  was  not 
satisfied  with  only  seeing  them.  He  admired  her  hands  and 
arms,  naked  to  the  shoulder,  and  whatever  was  hidden  from  view 
he  imagined  more  beautiful  still.  He  followed  her ;  she  fled, 
swifter  than  the  wind,  and  delayed  not  a  moment  at  his  entrea- 
ties. "Stay,"  said  he,  "daughter  of  Peneus  ;  I  am  not  a  foe. 
Do  not  fly  me  as  a  lamb  flies  the  wolf,  or  a  dove  the  hawk.  It 
is  for  love  I  pursue  you.  You  make  me  miserable,  for  fear  you 
should  fall  and  hurt  yourself  on  these  stones,  and  I  should  be  the 
cause.  Pray  run  slower,  and  I  will  follow  slower.  I  am  no 
clown,  no  rude  peasant.  Jupiter  is  my  father,  and  I  am  lord  of 
Delphos  and  Tenedos,  and  know  all  things,  present  and  future. 
I  ara  the  god  of  song  and  the  lyre. 

*•  Abate,  fair  fugitive,  abate  thy  speed, 
Dismiss  thy  fears,  and  turn  thy  beauteous  bead ; 

**  You  fly,  alas  !  not  knowing  whom  you  fly  { 
No  ill-bred  swain,  nor  rustic  clown,  am  I.**— Prior, 

"  My  arrows  fly  true  to  the  mark  ;  but,  alas  1  an  arrow  more 
fatal  than  mine  has  pierced  my  heart !  I  am  the  god  of  medi- 
cine, and  know  the  virtues  of  all  healing  plants.  Alas  !  I  suffer 
a  malady  that  no  balm  can  cure  I" 

The  nymph  continued  her  flight,  and  left  his  plea  half-uttered. 
And  even  as  she  fled  she  charmed  him.  The  wind  blew  hei 
garments,  and  her  unbound  hair  streamed  loose  behind  her.  The 
god  grew  impatient  to  find  his  wooings  thrown  away,  and,  sped 
jDy  Cupid,  gained  upon  her  in  the  race.  It  was  like  a  hound 
pursuing  a  hare,  with  open  jaws  ready  to  seize,  while  the  feebler 
animal  darts  forward,  slipping  from  the  very  grasp.  So  flew  the 
god  and  the  virgin — he  on  the  wings  of  love,  and  she  on  those 
of  fear.  The  pursuer  is  the  more  rapid,  however,  and  gains 
upon  her,  and  his  panting  breath  blows  upon  her  hair.  Her 
strength  begins  to  fail,  and,  ready  to  sink,  she  calls  upon  her 
father,  the  river-god:   "Help  me,  Peneus  1  open  the  earth  to

Stuck  fast  in  the  ground,  as  a  root ;  her  face  became  a  tree-top, 
retaing  nothing  of  its  former  self  but  its  beauty.  Apollo  stood 
amazed.  He  touched  the  stem,  and  felt  the  flesh  tremble  under 
the  new  bark.     He  embraced  the  branches  and  lavished  kisses

on  the  wood.  The  branches  shrank  from  his  lips.  "Since 
you  cannot  be  my  wife,"  said  he,  **  you  shall  assuredly  be  my 
tree.  I  will  wear  you  for  my  crown  ;  I  will  decorate  with  you 
my  heart  and  my  quiver ;  and  when  the  great  Roman  conquerors 
lead  up  the  triumphal  pomp  to  the  Capitol,  you  shall  be  woven 
into  wreaths  for  their  brows.  And,  as  eternal  youth  is  mine,  you 
also  shall  be  always  green,  and  your  leaf  know  no  decay." 

•*  I  espouse  thee  for  my  tree  t 
Be  thou  the  prize  of  honor  and  renown ; 
The  deathless  poet,  and  the  poem,  crown  ; 
Thou  shall  the  Roman  festivals  adorn. 
And,  after  poets,  be  by  victors  worn.**— OviD  (Dryden's  tr.). 

The  nymph,  now  changed  into  a  Laurel  tree,  bowed  its  head 
in  grateful  acknowledgment. 

That  Apollo  should  be  the  god  both  of  music  and  poetry  will 
not  appear  strange,  but  that  medicine  should  also  be  assigned  to 
his  province  may.  The  poet  Armstrong,  himself  a  physician, 
thus  accounts  for  it : — 

«•  Music  exalts  each  joy,  allays  each  grief, 
Expels  diseases,  softens  every  pain  ; 
And  hence  the  wise  of  ancient  days  adored 
One  power  of  physic,  melody  and  song,** 

The  story  of  Apollo  and  Daphne  is  often  aMuded  to  by  the 
poets.  Waller  applies  it  to  the  case  of  one  whose  amatory  verses, 
though  they  did  not  soften  the  heart  of  his  mistress,  yet  won  for 
the  poet  widespread  fame. 

*•  Yet  what  he  sung  in  his  immortal  strain, 
Though  unsuccessful,  was  not  sung  in  vain. 
All  but  the  nymph  that  should  redress  his  wrong, 
Attend  his  passion  and  approve  his  song, 
like  Phoebus  thus,  acquiring  unsought  praise. 
He  caught  at  love  and  filled  his  arms  with  bays.** 

The  following  stanza  from  Shelley's  "Adonais"  alludes  to 
Byron's  early  quarrel  with  the  reviewers : — 

**  The  herded  wolves,  bold  only  to  pursue ; 
The  obscene  ravens,  clamorous  o'er  the  detd ;

Pyr'a-mus  and  This'be. 

Pyr'a-mus  was  the  handsomest  youth,  and  This'be  the  fair, 
est  maiden,  in  all  Babylonia,  where  Semiramis  reigned.  Their 
parents  occupied  adjoining  houses  ;  thus  frequently  bringing  the 
young  people  together,  their  acquaintance  finally  ripened  into 
love.  They  would  gladly  have  married,  but  their  parents  forbade. 
One  thing,  however,  they  could  not  forbid — that  love  should  glow 
with  equal  ardor  in  the  bosoms  of  both.  They  conversed  by 
signs  and  glances,  and  the  fire  burned  more  intensely  for  being 
covered  up.  In  the  wall  that  parted  the  two  houses  there  was  a 
crack  caused  by  some  fault  in  the  structure.  No  one  had  re- 
marked it  before,  but  the  lovers  discovered  it.  What  will  not 
love  discover !  It  afforded  a  passage  to  the  voice,  and  tender 
messages  used  to  pass  backward  and  forward  through  the  crevice. 
As  they  stood,  Pyramus  on  this  side,  Thisbe  on  that,  their  breaths 
would  mingle.  **  Cruel  wall,"  they  said,  **why  do  you  keep 
two  lovers  apart  ?  But  we  will  not  be  ungrateful.  We  owe  you, 
we  confess,  the  privilege  of  transmitting  loving  words  to  willing 
ears."  Such  words  they  uttered  on  different  sides  of  the  wall ; 
and  when  night  came  and  they  must  say  farewell,  they  pressed 
their  lips  upon  the  wall,  she  on  her  side,  he  on  his,  as  they  could 
come  no  nearer. 

••And  through  wall's  chink,  poor  souls. 
They  are  content 
To  whisper." — SHAKESPEARE. 

Next  morning,  when  Aurora  had  put  out  the  stars,  and  the 
sun  had  melted  the  frost  from  the  grass,  they  met  at  the  accus- 
tomed place.  Then,  after  lamenting  their  hard  fate,  they  agreed 
that  next  night,  when  all  was  still,  they  would  slip  away  from 
watchful  eyes,  leave  their  dwellings  and  walk  out  into  the  fields; 
and,  to  insure  a  meeting,  repair  to  a  well-known  edifice,  standing

the  one  who  came  first  should  await  the  other  at  the  foot  of  a 
certain  tree.  It  was  a  white  mulberry-tree,  and  stood  near  a  cooj 
spring.  All  was  agreed  on,  and  they  waited  impatiently  for  the 
3un  to  go  down  beneath  the  waters  and  night  to  rise  up  from 
them.  Then  cautiously  Thisbe  stole  forth,  unobserved  by  the 
family,  her  head  covered  with  a  veil,  made  her  way  to  the  monu-

with  recent  slaughter,  approaching  the  fountain  to  slake  hei 
thirst.  Thisbe  fled  at  the  sight,  and  sought  refuge  in  the  hollow 
of  a  rock.  As  she  fled  she  dropped  her  veil.  The  lioness,  after 
drinking  at  the  spring,  turned  to  retreat  to  the  woods,  and  see  • 
ing  the  veil  on  the  ground,  tossed  and  rent  it  with  her  bloody 
mouth. 

Pyramus,  having  been  delayed,  now  approached  the  place  of 
meeting.  He  saw  in  the  sand  the  footsteps  of  the  lion,  and  the 
color  fled  from  his  cheeks  at  the  sight.  Presently  he  found  the 
veil  all  rent  and  bloody.  **  O,  hapless  girl,"  said  he,  "  I  have 
been  the  cause  of  thy  death  I  Thou,  more  worthy  of  life  than  I. 
hast  fallen  the  first  victim.  I  will  follow.  I  am  the  guilty  cause, 
in  tempting  thee  forth  to  a  place  of  such  peril,  and  not  being 
myself  on  the  spot  to  guard  thee.  Come  forth,  ye  lions,  from 
the  rocks,  and  tear  this  guilty  body  with  your  teeth."  He  took 
up  the  veil,  carried  it  with  him  to  the  appointed  tree,  and  covered 
it  with  kisses  and  with  tears.     **My  blood  also  shall  stain  youf

texture,"  said  he,  and  drawing  his  sword  plunged  it  into  his 
heart. 

*•  In  her  bosom  plunged  the  sword, 
All  warm  and  reeking  from  its  daughtered  lord." — OviD  (Eusden's  tr. ). 

The  blood  spirted  from  the  wound,  and  tinged  the  white 
mulberries  of  the  tree,  and  sinking  into  the  earth  reached  the 
roots,  so  that  the  red  color  mounted  through  the  trunk  to  the 
fruit. 

By  this  time,  Thisbe,  still  trembling  with  fear,  yet  wishing  not 
to  disappoint  her  lover,  stepped  cautiously  forth,  looking  anx- 
iously for  the  youth,  eager  to  tell  him  the  danger  she  had  escaped. 
When  she  came  to  the  spot  and  saw  the  changed  color  of  the 
mulberries,  she  doubted  whether  it  was  the  same  place.  While 
she  hesitated  she  saw  the  form  of  one  struggling  in  the  agonies 
of  death.  She  started  back,  a  shudder  ran  through  her  frame  as 
a  ripple  on  the  face  of  the  still  water  when  a  sudden  breeze 
sweeps  over  it.  But  as  soon  as  she  recognized  her  lover,  she 
screamed  and  beat  her  breast ;  embracing  the  lifeless  body,  pour- 
ing tears  into  its  wounds,  and  imprinting  kisses  on  the  cold  lips. 

"O,  Pyramus,"  she  cried,  **what  has  done  this?  Answer 
me,  Pyramus ;  it  is  your  own  Thisbe  that  speaks.  Hear  me, 
dearest,  and  lift  that  drooping  head  1'*  At  the  name  of  Thisbe, 
Pyramus  opened  his  eyes,  then  closed  them  again.  She  saw  her 
veil  stained  with  blood,  and  the  scabbard  empty  of  its  sword. 
"Thy  own  hand  has  slain  thee,  and  for  my  sake,'*  she  said.  **  I, 
too,  can  be  brave  for  once,  and  my  love  is  as  strong  as  thine.  I 
will  follow  thee  in  death,  for  I  have  been  the  cause ;  and  death, 
which  alone  conld  part  us,  shall  not  prevent  my  joining  thee. 
And  ye,  unhappy  parents  of  us  both,  deny  us  not  our  united  re- 
quest. As  love  and  death  have  joined  us,  let  one  tomb  contair 
us.  And  thou,  tree,  retain  the  marks  of  slaughter.  Let  thy 
berries  still  serve  for  memorials  of  our  blood."  So  saying,  she 
plunged  the  sword  into  her  breast.  Her  parents  consented  to 
her  wish,  the  gods  also  ratified  it.  The  two  bodies  were  buried 
in  one  sepulchre,  and  the  tree  ever  after  brought  forth  purple 
berries,  as  it  does  to  this  day. 

Moore,  in  the  Sylph's  Ball,  speaking  of  Davy's  Safety  Lamp, 
fa  reminded  of  the  wall  that  separated  Thisbe  and  her  lover ;—

Through  whose  small  holes  this  dangerous  pair

In  Mickle's  translation  of  the  Lusiad  occurs  the  following  aV 
Lusion  to  the  story  of  Pyramus  and  Thisbe,  and  the  nietamor- 
phosis  of  the  mulberries.  The  poet  is  describing  the  Island  of 
Love.  ^

And  stained  with  lovers'  blood,  in  pendent  rows

If  any  of  our  young  readers  can  be  so  hard-hearted  as  to  enjoy 
a  laugh  at  the  expense  of  poor  Pyramus  and  Thisbe,  they  may 
find  an  opportunity  by  turning  to  Shakespeare*  s  play  of  the  Mid- 
summer Night's  Dream,  where  it  is  most  amusingly  burlesqued. 

Ceph'a-lus  and  Pro'cris. 

Ceph'a-lus  was  a  beautiful  youth  and  fond  of  manly  sports. 
He  would  rise  before  the  dawn  to  pursue  the  chase.  Aurora  saw 
him  when  she  first  looked  forth,  fell  in  love  with  him,  and  stole 
him  away.  But  Cephalus  was  just  married  to  a  charming  wife 
whom  he  devotedly  loved.  Her  name  was  Pro'cris.  She  was 
a  favorite  of  Diana,  the  goddess  of  hunting,  who  had  given  her 
a  dog  which  could  outrun  every  rival,  and  a  javelin  which  would 
never  fail  of  its  mark  ;  and  Procris  gave  these  presents  to  her 
husband.  Cephalus  was  so  happy  in  his  wife  that  he  resisted  all 
the  entreaties  of  Aurora,  and  she  finally  dismissed  him  in  dis- 
pleasure, saying,  **  Go,  ungrateful  mortal,  keep  your  wife,  whom, 
if  I  am  not  much  mistaken,  you  will  one  day  be  very  sorry  you 
ever  saw  again.'* 

Cephalus  returned,  and  was  as  happy  as  ever  in  his  wife  and

his  woodland  sports.  Now  it  happened  some  angry  deity  had 
sent  a  ravenous  fox  to  annoy  the  country,  and  the  hunters  turned 
out  in  great  strength  to  capture  it.  Their  efforts  were  in  vain ; 
no  dog  could  run  it  down ;  and  at  last  they  came  to  Cephalus  to 
borrow  his  famous  dog,  whose  name  was  Lelaps.  No  sooner  was 
the  dog  let  loose  than  he  darted  off,  quicker  than  their  eye  could 
follow  him.  If  they  had  not  seen  his  footprints  in  the  sand,  they 
would  have  thought  he  flew.  Cephalus  and  others  stood  on  a 
hill  and  saw  the  race.  The  fox  tried  every  art ;  he  ran  in  a  cir- 
cle, and  turned  on  his  track,  the  dog  close  upon  him,  with  open 
jaws,  snapping  at  his  heels,  but  biting  only  the  air.  Cephalus 
was  about  to  use  his  javelin,  when  suddenly  he  saw  both  dog  and 
game  stop  instantly.  The  heavenly  powers,  who  had  given  both, 
were  not  willing  that  either  should  conquer.  In  the  very  atti- 
tude of  life  and  action  they  were  turned  into  stone.  So  lifelike 
and  natural  did  they  look,  you  would  have  thought,  as  you  looked 
at  them,  that  one  was  going  to  bark,  the  other  to  leap  forward. 
Cephalus,  though  he  had  lost  his  dog,  still  continued  to  take 
delight  in  the  chase.  He  would  go  out  at  early  morning,  rang- 
ing the  woods  and  hills  unaccompanied  by  anyone,  needing  no 
help,  for  his  javelin  was  a  sure  weapon  in  all  cases.  Fatigued 
with  hunting,  when  the  sun  got  high  he  would  seek  a  shady 
nook  where  a  cool  stream  flowed,  and,  stretched  on  the  grass, 
with  his  garments  thrown  aside,  would  enjoy  the  breeze.  Some- 
times he  would  say  aloud,  **Come,  sweet  breeze,  coii>e  and  Ian 
my  breast,  come  and  allay  the  heat  that  burns  me." 

••  A  hunter  once  in  a  grove  reclined. 
To  shun  the  noon's  bright  eye. 
And  oft  he  wooed  the  wandering  wind 

To  cool  his  brow  with  its  sigh. 
While  mute  lay  even  the  wild  bee's  huni. 
Nor  breath  could  stir  the  aspen's  hair, 
His  song  was  still,  *  Sweet  Air,  O  come  !* 

While  Echo  answered,  *  Come,  sweet  Air !'  "

Some  one  passing  by  one  day  heard  him  talking  in  this  way 
to  the  air,  and,  foolishly  believing  that  he  was  talking  to  some 
maiden,  went  and  told  the  secret  to  Procris,  Cephalus* s  wife. 
Love  is  credulous.     Procris,  at  the  sudden  shock,  fainted  away, 


CEPHALUS  ANL  FROCRIS,  39 

Presently  recovering,  she  said,  **  It  cannot  be  true ;  I  will  not 
believe  it  unless  I  myself  am  a  witness  to  it. ' '  So  she  waited, 
with  anxious  heart,  till  the  next  morning,  when  Cephalus  went 
to  hunt  as  usual.  Then  she  stole  out  after  him,  and  concealed 
herself  in  the  place  where  the  informer  directed  her.  Cephalus 
came  as  he  was  wont  when  tired  with  sport,  and  stretched  him- 
self on  the  green  bank,  saying,  **Come,  sweet  breeze,  come  and. 
fan  me  ;  you  know  how  I  love  you  I  you  make  the  groves  and  my 
solitary  rambles  delightful.'*  He  was  running  on  in  this  way 
when  he  heard,  or  thought  he  heard,  a  sound  as  of  a  sob  in  the 
bushes.  Supposing  it  some  wild  animal,  he  threw  his  javelin  at 
the  spot. 

"  But,  alas  !  it  was  not  the  white-hom^d  doe 
He  saw  in  the  rustling  grove, 
But  the  bridal  veil,  as  pure  as  snow. 

Of  his  own  young  wedded  love." — MooRE. 

A  cry  from  his  beloved  Procris  told  him  that  the  weapon  had 
too  surely  met  its  mark.  He  rushed  to  the  place,  and  found  her 
bleeding,  and  with  sinking  strength  endeavoring  to  draw  forth 
from  the  wound  the  javelin,  her  own  gift.  Cephalus  raised  her 
from  the  earth,  strove  to  stanch  the  blood,  and  called  her  to  re- 
vive and  not  to  leave  him  miserable,  to  reproach  himself  with 
her  death.  She  opened  her  feeble  eyes  and  forced  herself  to 
utter  these  few  words ;  **  I  implore  you,  if  you  have  ever  loved 
me,  if  I  have  ever  deserved  kindness  at  your  hands,  my  husband, 
grant  me  this  last  request :  do  not  marry  that  odious  Breeze  !" 
This  disclosed  the  whole  mystery  :  but  alas  !  what  advantage  to 
disclose  it  now  ?  She  died  ;  but  her  face  wore  a  calm  expression, 
and  she  looked  pityingly  and  forgivingly  on  her  husband  when 
he  made  her  understand  the  truth.

CHAPTER  IV. 

Ju'no  and  her  Rivals,  I'o  and  Cal-lis'to— Di-a'na  and 
Ac-tae'on — La-to'na  and  the  Rus'tics. 

Ju'pi-ter's  marriage  to  Ju'no  was  one  of  the  most  auspicious 
events  that  evei  took  place  on  Mount  Olympus.  The  gods  were 
all  present,  and  the  festivities  worthy  the  occasion.  But  the 
alliance  was  marred  by  discord  and  deception.  Jupiter  was 
faithless,  and  Juno  passionately  jealous. 

One  day  she  perceived  it  suddenly  grow  dark,  and  immedi- 
ately suspected  that  her  husband  had  raised  a  cloud  to  hide  some 
of  his  doings  that  would  not  bear  the  light.  So  she  brushed 
away  the  cloud,  and  saw  her  husband  on  the  banks  of  a  glassy 
river,  with  a  beautiful  heifer  standing  near  him.  Juno  suspected 
the  heifer's  form  concealed  some  fair  nymph  of  mortal  mould, — 
as  was,  indeed,  the  case  ;  for  it  was  I'o,  the  daughter  of  the  river 
god  Inachus,  whom  Jupiter  had  been  flirting  with,  and,  when 
he  became  aware  of  the  approach  of  his  wife,  had  changed  into 
that  form. 

Juno  joined  her  husband,  and  noticing  the  heifer  praised  its 
beauty,  and  asked  whose  it  was,  and  of  what  herd.  Jupiter,  to 
stop  questions,  replied  that  it  was  a  fresh  creation  from  the 
earth.  Juno  asked  to  have  it  as  a  gift.  What  could  Jupiter  do? 
He  was  loath  to  give  his  mistress  to  his  wife,  yet  how  refuse  so 
trifling  a  present  as  a  simple  heifer?  He  could  not,  without  ex- 
citing suspicion,  so  he  consented.  The  goddess  was  not  yet  re- 
lieved of  her  suspicions,  so  she  delivered  the  heifer  to  Argus,  to 
be  strictly  watched. 

Now  Argus  had  a  hundred  eyes  in  his  head,  and  never  went  to 
sleep  with  more  than  two  at  a  time,  so  that  he  kept  watch  on  lo 
constantly.  He  sufl"ered  her  to  feed  during  the  day,  and  at  night 
tied  her  up  with  a  vile  rope  round  her  neck.  She  would  have 
stretched  out  her  arms  to  implore  freedom  of  Argus,  but  she  had 
no  arms  to  stretch  out.  and  her  voice  was  a  bellow  that  fright-

ened  even  herself.  She  saw  her  father  and  her  sisters,  went 
near  them,  and  suffered  them  to  pat  her  back,  and  heard  them 
admire  her  beauty.  Her  father  reached  her  a  tuft  of  grass,  and 
she  licked  the  outstretched  hand.  She  longed  to  make  herself 
known  to  him,  and  would  have  uttered  her  wish ;  but,  alas  1 
words  were  wanting.  At  length  she  bethought  herself  of  writ 
ing,  and  inscribed  her  name — it  was  a  short  one-  —with  her  hoof 
on  the  sand.  Inachus  recognized  it,  and  discovering  that  hie 
daughter,  whom  he  had  long  sought  in  vain,  was  hidden  andei 
this  disguise,  mourned  over  her,  and,  embracing  her  white  neck, 
exclaimed,  "  Alasl  my  daughter,  it  would  have  been  a  less  grief 
to  have  lost  you  altogether  !"  While  he  thus  lamented,  Argus, 
observing,  came  and  drove  her  away,  and  took  his  seat  on  a 
high  bank,  from  whence  he  could  see  in  every  direction. 

Jupiter  was  troubled  at  beholding  the  sufferings  of  his  mis- 
tress, and  calling  Mercury  told  him  to  go  and  despatch  Argus. 
Mercury  made  haste,  put  his  winged  slippers  on  his  feet,  and  cap 
on  his  head,  took  his  sleep -producing  wand,  and  leaped  down 
from  the  heavenly  towers  to  the  earth.  There  he  laid  aside  his 
wings  and  kept  only  his  w^and,  with  which  he  presented  him- 
self as  a  shepherd  driving  his  flock.  As  he  strolled  on  he  blew 
upon  his  pipes.  These  were  what  are  called  the  Syrinx  or  Pan- 
dean pipes.  Argus  listened  with  delight,  for  he  had  never  seen 
the  instrument  before.  **  Young  man,"  said  he,  **come  and 
take  a  seat  by  me  on  this  stone.  There  is  no  better  place  for 
your  flock  to  graze  in  than  hereabouts,  and  here  is  a  pleasant 
shade  such  as  shepherds  love.**  Mercury  sat  down,  talked,  and 
told  stories  till  it  grew  late,  and  played  upon  his  pipes  his  most 
soothing  strains,  hoping  to  lull  the  watchful  eyes  to  sleep,  but  all 
in  vain  ;  for  Argus  still  contrived  to  keep  some  of  hi-3  eyes  open, 
though  he  shut  the  rest. 

**  The  eyes  of  Argus»  sentinel  of  Heaven  :  ^- 

Those  thousand  eyes  that  watch  aUernate  kept, 
Nor  all  o'er  all  his  body  waked  or  slept." 

— Statius  (Elton' s  tr. ). 

Among  other  stt^ries,  Mercury  told  him  how  the  instrument 
on  which  he  played  was  invented.  **  There  was  a  certain  nymph

and  spirits  of  the  wood ;  but  she  would  have  none  of  them,  but 
was  a  faithful  worshipper  of  Di-a'na,  and  followed  the  chase. 
You  would  have  thought  it  was  Diana  herself,  had  you  seen  her 
in  her  hunting-dress,  only  that  her  bow  was  of  horn  and  Diana's 
of  silver.  One  day,  as  she  was  returning  from  the  chase.  Pan 
met  her,  told  her  just  this,  and  added  more  of  Ae  same  sort. 
She  ran  away,  without  stopping  to  hear  his  compliments,  and  he 
pursued  till  she  came  to  the  bank  of  the  river,  where  he  overtook 
her,  and  she  had  only  time  to  call  for  help  on  her  friends,  the 
water-nymphs.  They  heard  and  consented.  Pan  threw  his 
arms  around  what  he  supposed  to  be  the  form  of  a  nymph,  and 
found  he  embraced  only  a  tuft  of  reeds  !  As  he  breathed  a  sigh 
the  air  sounded  through  the  reeds  and  produced  a  plaintive 
melody. 

"  Fair,  trembling  Syrinx  fled 
Arcadian  Pan,  with  such  a  fearful  dread. 
Poor  nymph  ! — poor  Pan  ! — how  he  did  weep  to  find 
Naught  but  a  lovely  sighing  of  the  wind 
Along  the  reedy  stream  ;  a  half-heard  strain 
Full  of  sweet  desoladon — balmy  pain." — Keats. 

The  god,  charmed  with  the  novelty  and  with  the  sweetness 
of  the  music,  said,  *  Thus,  then,  at  least,  you  shall  be  mine. ' 
And  he  took  some  of  the  reeds,  and  placing  them  together,  of 
unequal  lengths,  side  by  side,  made  an  instrument  which  he 
called  Syrinx,  in  honor  of  the  nymph.'*  Before  Mercury  had 
finished  his  story  he  saw  Argus's  eyes  all  asleep.  As  his  head 
nodded  forward  on  his  breast.  Mercury  with  one  stroke  cut  his 
neck  through,  and  tumbled  his  head  down  the  rocks.  O,  hap- 
less Argus  1  the  light  of  your  hundred  eyes  is  quenched  at  once  ! 
Juno  took  them  and  put  them  as  ornaments  on  the  tail  of  her 
peacock,  where  they  remain  to  this  day. 

"  From  Argus  slain  a  painted  peacock  grew. 

Fluttering  his  feathers  stain'd  with  various  hue.** — MosCHUS. 

But  the  vengeance  of  Juno  was  not  yet  satisfied.  She  sent  a 
gadfly  to  torment  To,  who  fled  over  the  whole  world  from  its 
pursuit.  She  swam  through  the  Ionian  Sea,  from  which  circum* 
stance  it  derived  its  name. 


CALLISTO,  43 

"  In  coining  time  that  hollow  of  the  se^ 
Shall  bear  the  name  Ionian,  and  present 
A  monument  of  lo's  passage  through, 
Unto  all  mortals." — E.  li.  JiKOWNiNG. 

She  then  roamed  over  the  plains  of  Illyria,  ascended  Mount 
f  laemus,  and  crossed  the  Thracian  strait,  thence  named  the  Bos- 
phorus  (cow-ford),  rambled  on  through  Scythia  and  the  coun 
try  of  the  Cimmerians,  and  arrived  at  last  on  the  banks  of  the 
Nile.  At  length  Jupiter  interceded  for  her,  and  upon  his  prom- 
ising not  to  pay  her  any  more  attentions  Juno  consented  to  re- 
store her  to  her  form.  It  was  curious  to  see  her  gradually  re- 
cover her  former  self.  The  coarse  hairs  fell  from  her  body,  hei 
horns  shrank  up,  her  eyes  grew  narrower,  her  mouth  shorter ; 
hands  and  fingers  came  instead  of  hoofs  to  her  fore  feet ;  in  fine, 
there  was  nothing  left  of  the  heifer,  except  her  beauty.  At  first 
she  was  afraid  to  speak  for  fear  she  should  low,  but  gradually 
she  recovered  her  confidence  and  was  restored  to  her  father  and 

sisters. 

Cal-lis'to. 

Cal-lis'to  was  another  maiden  who  excited  the  jealousy  of 
Juno,  and  the  goddess  changed  her  into  a  bear.  **  I  will  take 
away,**  said  she,  **that  beauty  with  which  you  have  captivated 
my  husband.**  Down  fell  Callisto  on  her  hands  and  knees ;  she 
tried  to  stretch  out  her  arms  in  supplication, — they  were  already 
beginning  to  be  covered  with  black  hair.  Her  hands  grew 
rounded,  became  armed  with  crooked  claws,  and  served  for  feet ; 
her  mouth,  which  Jove  used  to  praise  for  its  beauty,  became  a 
horrid  pair  of  jaws;  her  voice,  which  if  unchanged  would  have 
moved  the  heart  to  pity,  became  a  growl,  more  fit  to  inspire 
terror.  Yet  her  former  disposition  remained,  and  with  con- 
tinual groaning,  she  bemoaned  her  fate,  and  stood  upright  a? 
well  as  she  could,  lifting  up  her  paws  to  beg  for  mercy,  and  fell 
that  Jove  was  unkind,  though  she  could  not  tell  him  so.  Ah, 
how  often,  afraid  to  stay  in  the  woods  all  night  alone,  she  wan- 
dered about  the  neighborhood  of  ?ier  former  haunts ;  how  often, 
frightened  by  the  dogs,  did  she,  sc»  lately  a  huntress,  fly  in  terror 
from  the  hunters !  Often  she  fled  from  the  wild  beasts,  forget* 
ting  that  she  was  now  a  wild  beas<"  herself;  and,  bear  as  she  wa^ 
was  airaid  of  the  bears. 


44  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES. 

One  d^y  a  youth  espied  her  as  he  wa  hunting.  She  saw  hinj 
and  recognized  him  as  her  own  son,  now  grown  a  young  man. 
She  stopped  and  felt  inclined  to  embrace  him.  As  she  was 
about  to  approach,  he,  alarmed,  raised  his  hunting-spear,  and 
was  on  the  point  of  transfixing  her,  when  Jupiter,  beholding,  ar- 
rested the  crime,  and  snatching  away  both  of  them  placed  them 
in  the  heavens  as  the  Great  and  Little  Bear. 

Juno  was  in  a  rage  to  see  her  rival  so  set  in  honor,  and  has 
tened  to  ancient  Tethys  and  Oceanus,  the  powers  of  ocean,  and, 
in  answer  to  their  inquiries,  thus  told  the  cause  of  her  coming  ; 
**  Do  you  ask  why  I,  the  queen  of  the  gods,  have  left  the  heav- 
enly plains  and  sought  your  depths  ?  Learn  that  I  am  supplanted 
in  heaven — my  place  is  given  to  another.  You  will  hardly  be- 
lieve me ;  but  look  when  night  darkens  the  world,  and  you  shall 
see  the  two  of  whom  I  have  so  much  reason  to  complain  exalted 
to  the  heavens,  in  that  part  where  the  circle  is  the  smallest,  in 
the  neighborhood  of  the  pole.  Why  should  anyone  hereafter 
tremble  at  the  thought  of  offending  Juno,  when  such  rewards  are 
the  consequence  of  my  displeasure  ?  See  what  I  have  been  able 
to  effect  I  I  forbade  her  to  wear  the  human  form — she  is  placed 
among  the  stars  I  So  do  my  punishments  result — such  is  the 
extent  of  my  power  !  Better  that  she  should  have  resumed  her 
former  shape,  as  I  permitted  lo  to  do.  Perhaps  he  means  to 
marry  her  and  put  me  away  !  But  you,  my  foster-parents,  if  you 
feel  for  me,  and  see  with  displeasure  this  unworthy  treatment  of 
me,  show  it,  I  beseech  you,  by  forbidding  this  guilty  couple  from 
coming  into  your  waters.**  The  powers  of  the  ocean  assented, 
and,  consequently,  the  two  constellations  of  the  Great  and  Little 
Bear  move  round  and  round  in  heaven,  but  never  sink,  aa  the 
other  stars  do,  beneath  the  ocean. 

•*  One  after  one  the  stars  have  risen  and  set, 
Sparkling  upon  the  hoar-frost  of  my  chain ; 
The  Bear  that  prowled  all  night  about  the  fold 
Of  the  North-star  hath  shrunk  into  hi?  den. 
Scared  by  the  blithesome  footsteps  of  the  Dawn." 

— Lowell's  Prometheus. 

Milton  alludes  to  the  fact  that  the  constellation  of  the  Beaj 
never  sets,  when  he  says ; — 


DIANA  AND  ACTION.  45 

**  Let  my  lamp  at  midnight  hour 
Be  seen  in  some  high  lonely  tower, 
Where  I  may  oft  outwatch  the  Bear." — //  Penseroso. 

The  last  star  in  the  tail  of  the  Little  Bear  is  the  Pole-star,  called 
^jso  the  Cynosure.     Milton  also  says  : — ■ 

**  Straight  mine  eve  hath  caught  new  pleasures 

While  the  landscape  round  it  measures. 
*  *  *  *  * 

Towers  and  battlements  it  sees 

Bosomed  high  in  tufted  trees, 

Where  perhaps  some  beauty  lies. 

The  Cynosure  of  neighboring  eyes." — U Allegro. 

The  reference  here  is  both  to  the  Pole-star  as  the  guide  of 
mariners,  and  to  the  magnetic  attraction  of  the  North.  He  calls 
it  also  the  **  Star  of  Arcady,"  because  Callisto's  boy  was  named 
Areas,  and  they  lived  in  Arcadia.  In  * '  Comus, ' '  the  brother, 
benighted  in  the  woods,  says  : —

-Some  gentle  taper 


Though  a  rush  candle,  from  the  wicker  hole 

Of  some  clay  habitation,  visit  us 

With  thy  long  levelled  rule  of  streaming  light, 

And  thou  shalt  be  our  star  of  Arcady, 

Or  Tyrian  Cynosure.'* 

Di-a'na  and  Ac-tae'on. 

Thus,  fn  two  instances,  we  have  seen  Juno's  severity  to  her 
rivals ;  now  let  us  learn  how  a  virgin  goddess  punished  an  invader 
of  her  privacy. 

It  was  midday,  and  the  sun  stood  equally  distant  from  either 
goal,  when  young  Ac-tae'on,  son  of  King  Cadmus,  thus  ad- 
dressed the  youths  who,  with  him,  were  hunting  the  stag  in  the 
mountains : — 

**  Friends,  our  nets  and  our  weapons  are  wet  with  the  b?ood 
of  our  victims ;  we  have  had  sport  enough  for  one  day,  and  to- 
morrow we  can  renew  our  labors.  Now,  while  Phoebus  parches 
the  earth,  let  us  put  by  our  implements  and  indulge  ourselves 
with  rest.'* 

There  was  a  valley  thickly  enclosed  with  cypresses  and  pines,

sacired  to  the  huntress  queen,  Di-a'na.  In  the  extremity  of  tha 
valley  was  a  cave,  not  adorned  with  art,  but  nature  had  counter- 
feited art  in  its  construction ;  for  she  had  turned  the  arch  of  its 
roof  with  stones  as  delicately  fitted  as  if  by  the  hand  of  man. 
A  fountain  burst  out  from   one   side,  whose  open  basin  was 

bounded  by  a  grassy  rim. 
Here  the  goddess  of  the 
woods  used  to  come,  when 
weary  with  hunting,  and 
lave  her  virgin  limbs  ia 
the  sparkling  water. 

One  day, having  repaired 
thither  with  her  nymphs, 
she  handed  her  javelin,  her 
quiver  and  her  bow  to  one, 
her  robe  to  another,  while 
a  third  unbound  the  san- 
dals from  her  feet.  Then 
Crocale,  the  most  skilful 
of  them,  arranged  her  hair, 
and  Nephele,  Hyale  and 
the  rest  drew  water  in  ca- 
pacious urns.  While  the 
goddess  was  thus  employed 
in  the  labors  of  the  toilet, 
behold  Actaeon,  having 
quitted  his  companions, 
and  rambling  without  any 
especial  object,  came  to 
the  place,  led  thither  by 
his  destiny.  As  he  pre- 
sented himself  at  the  entrance  of  the  cave,  the  nymphs,  see- 
ing  a  man,  screamed  and  rushed  towards  the  goddess  to  hide 
her  with  their  bodies.  But  she  was  taller  than  the  rest,  and 
overtopped  them  all  by  a  head.  Such  a  color  as  tinges  the 
clouds  at  sunset  or  at  dawn  came  over  the  countenance  of  Diana, 
thus  taken  by  surprise.  Surrounded  as  she  was  by  her  nym.phs, 
she  yet  turned  half  away,  and  sought,  with  a  sudden  impulse,  for 
her  arrows.     As  they  were  not  at  hand,  she  dashed  the  watei

Into  Ihe  face  of  the  intruder,  adding  these  words:  **Nowgo 
and  tell,  (  you  can,  that  you  have  seen  Diana  unapparelled." 
Immediately  a  pair  of  branching  stag's  horns  grew  out  of  his 
head,  his  neck  gained  in  length,  his  ears  grew  sharp -pointed,  his 
hands  became  feet, 
his  arms  long  legs, 
his  body  was  cov- 
ered with  a  hairy 
spotted  hide.  Fear 
took  the  place  of 
his  former  boldness, 
and  the  hero  fled. 
He  could  not  but 
admire  his  own 
speed ;  but  when  he 
saw  his  horns  in  the 
water,  *' Ah, wretch- 
ed me  r '  he  would 
have  said,  but  no 
sound  followed  the 
effort.  He  groaned, 
and  tears  flowed 
down  the  face  which 
had  taken  the  place 
of  his  own.  Yet 
his  consciousness 
remained.  What 
shall  he  do?  —  go 
home  to  seek  the 
palace,  or  lie  hid 
in  the  woods  ?  The 
Matter  he  was  afraid. 


Actseon,  British  Museum, 


the  former  he  was  ashamed  to  do.  While  he  hesitated  the  dogs 
saw  him.  First  Melampus,  a  Spartan  dog,  gave  the  signal  with 
his  bark,  then  Pamphagus,  Dorceus,  Lelaps,  Theron,  Nape,  Ti- 
gris and  all  the  rest  rushed  after  him  swifter  than  the  wind. 
Over  rocks  and  cliffs,  through  mountain  gorges  that  seemed 
impracticable,  he  fled,  and  they  followed.  Where  he  had  often 
chased  the  stag  and  cheered  on  his  pack,  his  pack  now  chased 


^8  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 

him,  cheered  on  by  his  huntsmen.  He  longed  to  cry  out,  **  1 
am  Actaeon ;  recognize  your  master!"  but  the  words  came  not 
at  his  will.  The  air  resounded  with  the  bark  of  the  dogs. 
Presently  one  fastened  on  his  back,  another  seized  his  shoulder. 
While  they  held  their  master,  the  rest  of  the  pack  came  up  and 
buried  their  teeth  in  his  flesh. 

**  Nearer  they  came  and  nearer,  baying  loud, 

With  bloodshot  eyes  and  red  jaws  dripping  foam ; 

And  when  I  strove  to  check  their  savagery, 

Speaking  with  words,  no  voice  articulate  came, 

Only  a  dumb,  low  bleat.     Then  all  the  throng 

Leapt  swift  on  me,  and  tore  me  as  I  lay  !" — Lewis  Mqrris, 

He  groaned — not  in  a  human  voice,  yet  certainly  not  in  a 
stag's — and  falling  on  his  knees,  raised  his  eyes,  and  would  have 
raised  his  arms  in  supplication,  if  he  had  had  them.  His  friends 
and  fellow -huntsmen  cheered  on  the  dogs,  and  looked  every- 
where for  Actaeon,  calling  on  him  to  join  the  sport.  At  the 
sound  of  his  name  he  turned  his  head,  and  heard  them  regret 
that  he  should  be  away.  He  earnestly  wished  he  was.  He 
would  have  been  well  pleased  to  see  the  exploits  of  his  dogs, 
but  to  feel  them  was  too  much.  They  were  all  around  him, 
rending  and  tearing ;  and  it  was  not  till  they  had  torn  out  his 
life  that  the  anger  of  Diana  was  satisfied.' 

In  Shelley's  poem  **  Adonais  "  is  the  following  allusion  to  the 
story  of  Actaeon : — 

•*  Midst  others  of  less  note  came  one  frail  form, 
A  phantom  among  men  ;  companionless 
As  the  last  cloud  of  an  expiring  storm. 
Whose  thunder  is  its  knell ;  he,  as  I  guess, 
Had  gazed  on  Nature's  naked  loveliness, 
Actaeon-like,  and  now  he  fled  astray 
With  feeble  steps  o'er  the  world's  wilderness; 
And  his  own  Thoughts,  along  that  rugged  way. 
Pursued  like  raging  hounds  their  father  and  their  prey." 

"—Stanza  31. 

The  allusion  is  probably  to  Shelley  himself. 

'  The  history  of  Diana  involves  many  contradictions.  She  was  originally  a 
Latin  goddess,  but  finally  became  identified  with  the  Greek,  Artemis.  Diana 
of  the  Ephesians  had  much  in  common,  and  was  essentially  the  same  deity. 
Their  statues,  however,  bear  no  resemblance,  and  their  worship  was  marked  by 
aoany  contrasts. 


LATONA  ASD  THE  RUSTICS.  49 

La-to'na  and  the  Rus'tics. 

Some  thought  the  goddess  in  this  instance  more  severe  than 
just,  while  others  praised  her  conduct  as  strictly  consistent  with 
her  virgin  dignity.  As  usual,  the  recent  event  brought  older 
ones  to  mind,  and  one  of  the  bystanders  told  this  story.  **  Some 
countrymen  of  Lycia  once  insulted  the  goddess  La-to'na,  but 
not  with  impunity.  When  I  was  young,  my  father,  who  had 
grown  too  old  for  active  labors,  sent  me  to  Lycia  to  drive  thence 
some  choice  oxen,  and  there  I  saw  the  very  pond  and  marsh 
where  the  wonder  happened.  Near  by  stood  an  ancient  altar, 
black  with  the  smoke  of  sacrifice  and  almost  buried  among  the 
reeds.  I  inquired  whose  altar  it  might  be,  whether  of  Faunus  or 
the  Naiads  or  some  god  of  the  neighboring  mountain,  and  one 
of  the  country  people  replied,  *  No  mountain  or  river  god  pos- 
sesses this  altar,  but  she  whom  royal  Juno  in  her  jealousy  drove 
from  land  to  land,  denying  her  any  spot  of  earth  whereon  to  rear 
her  twins.  Bearing  in  her  arms  the  infant  deities,  Latona  reached 
this  land,  weary  with  her  burden  and  parched  with  thirst.  By 
chance  she  espied  in  the  bottom  of  the  valley  this  pond  of  clear 
water,  where  the  country  people  were  at  work  gathering  willows 
and  osiers.  The  goddess  approached,  and  kneeling  on  the  bank 
would  have  slaked  her  thirst  in  the  cool  stream,  but  the  rustics 
forbade  her.  *  Why  do  you  refuse  me  water  ? '  said  she  ;  *  water 
is  free  to  all.  Nature  allows  no  one  to  claim  as  property  the  sun- 
shine, the  air,  or  the  water.  I  come  to  take  my  share  of  the 
common  blessing.  Yet  I  ask  it  of  you  as  a  favor.  I  ha^'e  no 
intention  of  washing  my  limbs  in  it,  weary  though  they  be,  but 
only  to  quench  my  thirst.  My  mouth  is  so  dry  that  I  can  hardly 
speak.  A  draught  of  water  would  be  nectar  to  me  ;  it  would  re- 
vive me,  and  I  would  own  myself  indebted  to  you  for  life  itself.  ■ 
Let  these  infants  move  your  pity,  who  stretch  out  their  little 
arms  as  if  to  plead  for  me;'  and  the  children,  as  it  happened, 
were  stretching  out  their  arms. 

**  Who  would  not  have  been  moved  with  these  gentle  words 
of  the  goddess  ?  But  these  clowns  persisted  in  their  rudeness ; 
they  even  added  jeers  and  threats  of  violence  if  she  did  not  leave 
the  place.  Nor  was  this  all.  They  waded  into  the  pond  and 
stirred  up  the  mud  with  their  feet,  so  as  to  make  the  water  unfic 


50  STOJtIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES. 

to  drink.  Laiona  was  so  angry  that  she  ceased  to  mina  her  thirst 
She  no  longer  supplicated  the  clowns,  but  lifting  her  hands  to 
heaven  exclaimed,  *  May  they  never  quit  that  pool,  but  pass  their 
lives  there  !'  And  it  came  to  pass  accordingly.  They  now 
live  in  the  water,  sometimes  totally  submerged,  then  raising  their 
heads  above  the  surface  or  swimming  upon  it.  Sometimes  they 
come  out  upon  the  bank,  but  soon  leap  back  again  into  the 
water.  '  The)-  still  use  their  base  voices  in  railing,  and  though  the) 
have  the  water  all  to  themselves,  are  not  ashamed  to  croak  in 
the  midst  of  it.  Their  voices  are  harsh,  their  throats  bloated, 
their  mouths  have  become  stretched  by  constant  railing,  their 
necks  have  shrunk  up  and  disappeared,  and  their  heads  are  joined 
to  their  bodies.  Their  backs  are  green,  their  disproportioned 
bellies  white,  and  in  short  they  are  now  frogs,  and  dwell  in  the 
slimy  pool." 

This  story  explains  the  allusion  in  one  of  Milton's  sonnets, 
*'  On  me  detraction  which  followed  upon  his  writing  certain 
treatises.** 

"  I  did  but  prompt  the  age  to  quit  their  clogs 
By  the  known  laws  of  ancient  hberty, 
When  straight  a  barbarous  noise  environs  me 

Of  owls  and  cuckoos,  asses,  apes  and  dogs. 

As  when  those  hinds  that  were  transformed  to  frogs 

*    Railed  at  Latona's  twin-born  progeny. 
Which  after  held  the  sun  and  moon  in  fee." 

The  persecution  which  Latona  experienced  from  Juno  is  al- 
luded to  in  the  story.  The  tradition  was  that  the  future  mother 
of  Apollo  and  Diana,  flying  from  the  wrath  of  Juno,  besought 
all  the  islands  of  the  .^gean  to  afford  her  a  place  of  rest,  but  all 
feared  too  much  the  potent  queen  of  heaven  to  assist  her  rival. 
Delos  alone  consented  to  become  the  birthplace  of  the  future 
deities.  Delos  was  then  a  floating  island  ;  but  when  Latona  ar- 
rived there  Jupiter  fastened  it  with  adamantine  chains  to  the 
bottom  of  the  sea,  that  it  might  be  a  secure  resting-place  for  hi8 
beloved.     Byron  alludes  to  Delos  in  his  Don  Juan  ; — 

**  The  isles  of  Greece  !  the  isles  of  Greece ! 
Where  burning  Sappho  loved  and  sung, 
Where  grew  the  arts  of  war  and  peace. 
Where  Delos  rose  and  Phoebus  sprung  I"

CHAPTER  V. 

Pha'e-ton. 

Pha'e-ton  was  the  son  of  Apollo  and  the  nymph  Clymene. 
One  day  a  school -fellow  laughed  at  the  idea  of  his  being  the  son 
^{  the  god,  and  Phaeton  went  in  rage  and  shame  and  reported 
it  to  his  mother.  **If/'  said  he,  **  I  am  indeed  of  heavenly 
birth,  give  me,  mother,  some  proof  of  it,  and  establish  my  claim 
to  the  honor. ' '  Clymene  stretched  forth  her  hands  towards  the 
skies  and  said,  **I  call  to  witness  the  Sun  which  looks  down 
upon  us,  that  I  have  told  you  the  truth.  If  I  speak  falsely,  let 
this  be  the  last  time  I  behold  his  light.  But  it  needs  not  much 
labor  to  go  and  inquire  for  yourself;  the  land  whence  the  Sun 
rises  lies  next  to  ours.  Go  and  demand  of  him  whether  he  will 
own  you  as  a  son."  Phaeton  heard  with  delight.  He  travelled 
to  India,  which  lies  directly  in  the  regions  of  sunrise,  and,  full 
of  hope  and  pride,  approached  the  goal  whence  his  parent  begins 
his  course. 

The  palace  of  the  Sun  stood  reared  aloft  on  columns,  glitter* 
ing  with  gold  and  precious  stones,  while  polished  ivory  formed 
tne  ceilings,  and  silver  the  doors. 


52  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 

The  workmanship  surpassed  the  material,'  for  upon  the  walls 
Vulcan  had  represented  earth,  sea  and  skies,  with  their  inhabi- 
tants. In  the  sea  were  the  nymphs,  some  sporting  in  the  waves^ 
some  riding  on  the  backs  of  fishes,  while  others  sat  upon  the 
rocks  and  dried  their  sea-green  hair.  Their  faces  were  not  all 
alike  nor  yet  unlike,- — but  such  as  sisters  ought  to  be.*  The 
earth  had  its  towns  and  forests  and  rivers  and  rustic  divinities. 
Over  all  was  carved  the  likeness  of  the  glorious  heaven  ;  and  on 
the  silver  doors  the  twelve  signs  of  the  zodiac,  six  on  each  side. 

*The  sun's  bright  palace,  on  high  columns  rais'd, 
Withburnish'd  gold  and  flaming  jewels  blaz'd, 
The  folding  gates  diftus'd  a  silver  light. 
And  with  a  milder  gleam  refresh'dthe  sight." — Addison. 

Clymene's  son  advanced  up  the  steep  ascent  and  entered  the 
halls  of  his  disputed  father.  He  approached  the  paternal  pres- 
ence, but  stopped  at  a  distance,  for  the  light  was  more  than  he 
could  bear.  Phoebus,  arrayed  in  a  purple  vesture,  sat  on  a 
throne  which  glittered  as  with  diamonds.  On  his  right  hand 
and  his  left  stood  the  Day,  the  Month,  and  the  Year,  and,  at 
regular  intervals,  the  Hours.  Spring  stood  with  her  head 
crowned  with  flowers,  and  Summer,  with  garment  cast  aside, 
and  a  garland  formed  of  spears  of  ripened  grain,  and  Autumn, 
with  his  feet  stained  with  grape-juice,  and  icy  Winter,  with  his  hair 
stiffened  with  hoar-frost.  Surrounded  by  these  attendants,  the 
Sun,  with  the  eye  that  sees  everything,  beheld  the  youth  daz- 
zled with  the  novelty  and  splendor  of  the  scene,  and  inquired 
the  purpose  of  his  errand.  The  youth  replied,  **  O,  light  of  the 
boundless  world,  Phoebus,  my  father, — if  you  permit  me  to 
use  thai  name, — give  me  some  proof,  I  beseech  you,  by  which  I 
may  be  known  as  yours.'*  He  ceased;  and  his  father,  laying 
iside  the  beams  that  shone  all  around  his  head,  bade  him  ap- 
proach, and  embracing  him,  said,  **My  son,  you  deserve  not  to 
be  disowned,  and  I  confirm  what  your  mother  has  told  you.  To 
put  an  end  to  your  doubts,  ask  what  you  will,  the  gift  shall  be 
yours.  I  call  to  witness  that  dreadful  lake,  which  I  never  saw, 
but  v^hich  we  gods  swear  by  in  our  most  solemn  engagements.'* 
Phaeton  immediately  asked  to  be  permitted  for  one  day  to  drivi

the  chariot  of  the  sun.  The  father  repented  of  his  promise  j 
thrice  and  four  times  he  shook  his  radiant  head  in  warning.  **  I 
have  spoken  rashly,"  said  he;  **this  only  request  I  would 
fain  deny.  I  beg  you  to  withdraw  it.  It  is  not  a  safe  boon, 
nor  one,  my  Phaeton,  suited  to  your  youth  and  strength.  Your 
lot  is  mortal,  and  you  ask  what  is  beyond  a  mortal's  power.  In 
your  ignorance  you  aspire  to  do  that  which  not  even  the  god? 
themselves  may  do.  None  but  myself  may  drive  the  flaming  cai 
of  day.  Not  even  Jupiter,  whose  terrible  right  arm  hurls  the 
thunderbolts.  The  first  part  of  the  way  is  steep,  and  such  as  the 
horses  when  fresh  in  the  morning  can  hardly  climb  ;  the  middle 
is  high  up  in  the  heavens,  whence  I  myself  can  scarcely,  with- 
out alarm,  look  down  and  behold  the  earth  and  sea  stretched  be- 
neath me.  The  last  part  of  the  road  descends  rapidly,  and  re- 
quires most  careful  driving.  Tethys,  who  is  waiting  to  receive 
me,  often  trembles  for  me  lest  I  should  fall  headlong.  Add  to 
all  I  his,  the  heaven  is  all  the  time  turning  round  and  carrying 
the  stars  with  it.  I  have  to  be  perpetually  on  my  guard  lest  that 
mo>  ement,  which  sweeps  everything  else  along,  should  hurry 
me  also  away.  Suppose  I  should  lend  you  the  chariot,  what 
would  you  do  ?  Could  you  keep  your  course  while  the  sphere 
was  revolving  under  you  ?  Perhaps  you  think  that  there  are  for- 
ests and  cities,  the  abodes  of  gods,  and  palaces  and  temples  on 
the  way.  On  the  contrary,  the  road  is  through  the  midst  of 
frightful  monsters.  You  pass  by  the  horns  of  the  Bull,  in  front 
of  the  Archer,  and  near  the  Lion's  jaws,  and  where  the  Scorpion 
stretches  its  arms  in  one  direction  and  the  Crab  in  another.  Nor 
will  you  find  it  easy  to  guide  those  horses,  with  their  breasts  full 
of  fire  that  they  breathe  forth  from  their  mouths  and  nostrils.  I 
can  scarcely  govern  them  myself  when  they  are  unruly  and  re . 
sist  the  reins.  Beware,  my  son,  lest  I  be  the  donor  of  a  fata 
gift ;  recall  your  request  while  yet  you  may.  Do  you  ask  me 
for  a  proof  that  you  are  sprung  from  my  blood  ?  I  give  you  a 
proof  in  my  fears  for  you.  Look  at  my  face,-^I  would  that  you 
could  look  into  my  breast;  you  would  there  see  all  a  father's 
anxiety.  Finally,'*  he  continued,  'Mook  round  the  world  and 
choose  whatever  you  will  of  what  earth  or  sea  contains  most 
precious, — ask  it  and  fear  no  refusal.  This  only  I  pray  you  not 
to  urge.     It  is  not  honor,  but  destruction  you  seek-

Why  do  you  hang  round  my  neck  and  still  entreat  me  ?  You 
shall  have  it  if  you  persist, — the  oath  is  sworn  and  must  be  kept, 
— but  I  beg  you  to  choose  more  wisely. ' ' 

**  Choose  out  a  gift  from  seas,  or  earth,  or  skies. 
For  open  to  your  wish  all  nature  lies  j  ' 

Only  decline  this  one  unequal  task. 
For  'tis  a  mischief,  not  a  gift,  you  ask." — Addison. 

He  ended ;  but  the  youth  rejected  all  admonition,  and  held 
to  his  demand.  So,  having  resisted  as  long  as  he  could,  Phoebu? 
at  last  led  the  way  to  where  stood  the  lofty  chariot. 

It  was  of  gold,  the  gift  of  Vulcan ;  the  axle  was  of  gold,  the 
pole  and  wheels  of  gold,  the  spokes  of  silver.  Along  the  seat 
were  rows  of  chrysolites  and  diamonds,  which  reflected  all  around 
the  brightness  of  the  sun.  While  the  daring  youth  gazed  in  ad- 
miration, the  early  Dawn  threw  open  the  purple  doors  of  the 
east,  and  showed  the  pathway  strewn  with  roses.  The  stars  with- 
drew, marshalled  by  the  Daystar,  which  last  of  all  retired  also. 
The  father,  when  he  saw  the  earth  beginning  to  glow,  and  the 
Moon  preparing  to  retire,  ordered  the  Hours  to  harness  up  the 
horses.  They  obeyed,  and  led  forth  from  the  lofty  stalls  the 
steeds  full  fed  with  ambrosia,  and  attached  the  reins.  Then  the 
father  bathed  the  face  of  his  son  with  a  powerful  unguent,  and 
made  him  capable  of  enduring  the  brightness  of  the  flame.  He  set 
the  rays  on  his  head,  and  with  a  foreboding  sigh  said,  '*  If,  m^  son, 
you  will  in  this  at  least  heed  my  advice,  spare  the  whip  and  hold 
tight  the  reins.  They  go  fast  enough  of  their  owy  accord ;  the 
labor  is  to  hold  them  in.  You  are  not  to  take  the  straight  road 
directly  between  the  five  circles,  but  turn  ofl*  to  the  left.  Keep 
within  the  limit  of  the  middle  zone,  and  avoid  the  northern  and 
the  southern  alike.  You  will  see  the  marks  of  the  wheels,  and 
they  will  serve  to  guide  you.  And,  that  the  skies  and  the  earth 
may  each  receive  their  due  share  of  heat,  go  not  too  high,  or  you 
will  burn  the  heavenly  dwellings,  nor  too  low,  or  you  will  set 
the  earth  on  fire;  the  middle  course  is  safest  and  best.*  And 
now  I  leave  you  to  your  chance,  which,  I  hope,  will  plan  better 
for  you  than  you  have  done  for  yourself.  Night  is  passing  out 
of  the  western  gates,  and  we  can  delay  no  longer.     Take  the

reins  ;  but  if,  at  last,  your  heart  fails  you,  and  you  will  benefit  by 
my  advice,  stay  where  you  are  in  safety,  and  suffer  me  to  light 
and  warm  the  earth."  The  agile  youth  sprang  into  the  chariot, 
stood  erect  and  grasped  the  reins  with  delight,  pouring  out  thanks 
to  his  reluctant  parent. 

Meanwhile  the  horses  fill  the  air  with  their  snortings  and  fiery 
breath,  and  stamp  the  ground  impatient.  Now  the  bars  are  let 
down,  and  the  boundless  plain  of  the  universe  lies  open  before 
them.  They  dart  forward  and  cleave  the  opposing  clouds,  and 
outrun  the  morning  breezes  which  started  from  the  same  eastern 
goal.  The  steeds  soon  perceived  that  the  load  they  drew  was 
lighter  than  usual ;  and  as  a  ship  without  ballast  is  tossed  hither 
and  thither  on  the  sea,  so  the  chariot,  without  its  accustomed 
weight,  was  dashed  about  as  if  empty.  They  rush  headlong  and 
leave  the  travelled  road.  He  is  alarmed,  and  knows  not  how 
to  guide  them ;  nor,  if  he  knew,  has  he  the  power.  Then,  for 
the  first  time,  the  Great  and  Little  Bear  were  scorched  with  heat, 
and  would  fain,  if  it  were  possible,  have  plunged  into  the  water ; 
and  the  Serpent  which  lies  coiled  up  round  the  north  pole,  tor- 
pid and  harmless,  grew  warm,  and  with  warmth  felt  its  rage  re- 
vive. Bootes,  they  say,  fled  away,  though  encumbered  with  his 
plough,  and  all  unused  to  rapid  motion. 

When  hapless  Phaeton  looked  down  upon  the  earth,  now 
spreading  in  vast  extent  beneath  him,  he  grew  pale  and  his 
knees  shook  with  terror.  In  spite  of  the  glare  all  around  him, 
the  sight  of  his  eyes  grew  dim.  He  wished  he  had  never  touched 
his  father's  horses,  never  learned  his  parentage,  never  prevailed 
in  his  request.  He  is  borne  along  like  a  vessel  that  flies  before 
a  tempest,  when  the  pilot  can  do  no  more  and  betakes  himself 
to  his  prayers.  What  shall  he  do  ?  Much  of  the  heavenly  road 
is  left  behind,  but  more  remains  before.  He  turns  his  eyes  from 
one  direction  to  the  other  ;  now  to  the  goal  whence  he  began  his 
course,  now  to  the  realms  of  sunset  which  he  is  not  destined  to 
reach.  He  loses  his  self-command,  and  knows  not  what  to  do— 
whether  to  draw  tight  the  reins  or  throw  them  loose  ;  he  forgets 
the  names  of  the  horses.  He  sees  with  terror  the  monstrous 
forms  scattered  over  the  surface  of  heaven.  Here  the  Scorpion 
extended  his  two  great  arms,  with  his  tail  and  crooked  claws 
stretching  over  two  signs  of  the  zodiac.     When  the  boy  beheld

age  failed,  and  the  reins  fell  from  his  hands.  The  horses,  when 
they  felt  them  loose  on  their  backs,  dashed  headlong,  and  unre- 
strained went  off  into  unknown  regions  of  the  sky,  in  among  the 
stars,  hurling  the  chariot  over  pathless  places,  now  up  in  high 
heaven,  now  down  almost  to  the  earth.  The  Moon  saw  with 
astonishment  her  brother's  chariot  running  beneath  her  own. 
The  clouds  begin  to  smoke,  and  the  mountain  tops  take  fire  ;  the 
fields  are  parched  with  heat,  the  plants  wither,  the  trees  with 
their  leafy  branches  burn,  the  harvest  is  ablaze  1  But  these  are 
small  things.  Great  cities  perished,  with  their  walls  and  towers  ; 
whole  nations  with  their  people  were  consumed  to  ashes  !  The 
forest-clad  mountains  burned,  Athos  and  Taurus  and  Tmolus  and 
GLte  ;  Ida,  once  celebrated  for  fountains,  but  now  all  are  dry  ;  the 
Muses'  mountain  Helicon,  and  H?emus ;  ^tna,  with  fires  within 
and  without,  and  Parnassus,  with  his  two  peaks,  and  Rhodope, 
forced  at  last,  to  part  with  his  snowy  crown.  Her  cold  climate 
was  no  protection  to  Scythia,  Caucasus  burned,  and  Ossa  and 
Pindus,  and,  greater  than  both,  Olympus  ;  the  Alps  high  in  air, 
and  the  Apennines  crowned  with  clouds. 

Then  Phaeton  beheld  the  world  on  fire,  and  felt  the  heat  intol- 
erable. The  air  he  breathed  was  like  the  air  of  a  furnace  and 
full  of  burning  ashes,  and  the  smoke  was  of  a  pitchy  dark- 
ness. He  dashed  forward  he  knew  not  whither.  Then,  it 
is  believed,  the  people  of  Ethiopia  became  black  by  the  blood 
being  forced  so  suddenly  to  the  surface,  and  the  Libyan  desert 
was  dried  up  to  the  condition  in  which  it  remains  to  this  day. 
The  Nymphs  of  the  fountains,  with  dishevelled  hair,  mourned 
their  waters,  nor  were  the  rivers  safe  beneath  their  banks  ;  Tanais 
smoked,  and  Caicus,  Xanthus  and  Meander.  Babylonian  Eu- 
phrates and  Ganges,  Tagus  with  golden  sands,  and  Cayster  where 
the  swans  resort.  Nile  fled  away  and  hid  his  head  in  the  desert, 
and  there  it  still  remains  concealed.  Where  he  used  to  discharge 
his  waters  through  seven  mouths  into  the  sea,  there  seven  dry 
channels  alone  remained.  The  earth  cracked  open,  and  through 
the  chinks  light  broke  into  Tartarus,  and  frightened  the  king  of 
shadows  and  his  queen.  The  sea  shrank  up.  Where  before 
was  water,  it  became  a  dry  plain  ;  and  the  mountains  that  lie 
beneath  the  waves  lifted  up  their  heads  and   became  islands.

The  fishes  sought  the  lowest  depths,  and  the  dolphins  no  longer 
ventured  as  usual  to  sport  on  the  surface.  Even  Nereus,  and  his 
wife  Doris,  with  the  Nereides,  their  daughters,  sought  the  deepest 
caves  for  refuge.  Thrice  Neptune  essayed  to  raise  his  head

shoulders  bare,  screening  her  face  with  her  hand,  looked  up  to 
heaven,  and  with  a  husky  voice  called  on  Jupiter. 

'*0,  ruler  of  the  gods,  if  I  have  deserved  this  treatment,  and 
it  is  your  will  that  I  perish  w:>.h  fire,  why  withhold  your  thunder- 
bolts? Let  me  at  least  fall  by  your  hand.  Is  this  the  reward 
of  my  fertility,  of  my  obedient  service?  Is  it  for  this  that  I 
have  supplied  herbage  for  cattle,  and  fruits  for  men,  and  frankin- 
cense for  your  altars?  But  if  I  am  unworthy  of  regard,  what  has 
my  brother  Ocean  done  to  deserve  such  a  fate  ?     If  neither  of  us

can  excite  your  pity,  think,  I  pray  you,  of  your  own  heaven,  and 
behold  how  both  the  poles  are  smoking  which  sustain  youf 
palace,  which  must  fall  if  they  be  destroyed.  Atlas  faints,  and 
scarce  holds  up  his  burden.  If  sea,  earth,  and  heaven  perish, 
we  fall  into  ancient  Chaos.  Save  what  yet  remains  to  us  from 
the  devouring  flame.  O,  take  thought  for  our  deliverance  in 
this  awful  moment ! ' ' 

Thus  spoke  Earth,  and,  overcome  with  heat  and  thirst,  could 
say  no  more.  Then  Jupiter  omnipotent,  calling  to  witness  all 
the  gods,  including  him  who  had  lent  the  chariot,  and  showing 
them  that  all  was  lost  unless  some  speedy  remedy  were  applied, 
mounted  the  lofty  tower  from  whence  he  diffuses  clouds  over  the 
earth  and  hurls  the  forked  lightnings.  But  at  that  time  not  a 
cloud  was  to  be  found  to  interpose  for  a  screen  to  earth  nor  was 
a  shower  remaining  unexhausted.  He  thundered,  and,  brandish- 
ing a  lightning-bolt  in  his  right  hand,  launched  it  against  the 
charioteer,  and  struck  him  at  the  same  moment  from  his  seat 
and  from  existence  !  Phaeton,  with  his  hair  on  fire,  fell  head- 
long, like  a  shooting  star  which  marks  the  heavens  with  its  bright- 
ness as  it  falls,  and  Eridanus,  the  great  river,  received  him  and 
cooled  his  burning  frame. 

**  And  Phaethon,  caught  in  mid  career, 
And  hurled  from  the  Sun  to  utter  sunlessness, 
Like  a  flame-bearded  comet,  with  ghastliest  hiss. 
Fell  headlong  in  the  amazed  Eridanus, 
Monarch  of  streams,  who  on  the  Italian  fields 
Let  loose,  and  far  beyond  his  flowery  lips 
Foam- white,  ran  ruinous  to  the  Adrian  deep." — WORSLEY. 

The  Italian  Naiades  reared  a  tomb  for  him,  and  inscribed  these 
words  upon  the  stone  : 

*•  Driver  of  Phoebus'  chariot.  Phaeton, 

Struck  by  Jove' s  thunder,  rests  beneath  this  stone. 
He  could  not  rule  his  fether's  car  of  fire, 
Yet  was  it  much  so  nobly  to  asnire."* — OviD. 

His  three  sisters,  the  He-li'a-des,as  they  were  called,  lamented 
his  fate,  and  were  turned  into  poplar-trees  on  the  banks  of  the 
river,  while  their  tears,  which  continued  to  flow,  became  ambei 
as  they  dropped  into  the  stream.*

O'er  Phaeton  untimely  dead." — Milman. 

Phaeton's  most  intimate  friend,  Cycnus,  continued  to  lingt^r 
about  the  scene  of  his  death.  He  would  frequently  plunge  into 
;he  river  and  bring  forth  some  ghastly  relic  of  the  disaster ;  but 
the  gods  grew  angry  and  changed  him  into  a  swan.  Owing  to 
this  fact,  the  swan  ever  sails  about  in  the  most  pensive  manner, 
and  frequently  thrusts  its  head  into  the  water,  as  if  to  continue 
the  search. 

In  the  beautiful  lines  of  Walter  Savage  Landor,  descriptive  of 
the  Sea-shell,  there  is  an  allusion  to  the  Sun's  palace  and  chariot. 
The  water-nymph  says : 


<< 


I  have  sinuous  shells  of  pearly  hue 


Within,  and  things  that  lustre  have  imbibed 

In  the  sun's  palace  porch,  where,  when  unyoked. 

His  chariot- wheel  stands  midway  in  the  wave. 

Shake  one  and  it  awakens ;  then  apply 

Its  polished  lip  to  your  attentive  ear. 

And  it  remembers  its  august  abodes. 

And  murmurs  as  the  ocean  murmurs  there."— C^r,  Book  I,

Bacchus,  on  a  certain  occasion,  found  his  old  school-mastei 
and  foster-father,  Silenus,  missing.  The  old  man  had  been 
drinking,  and  in  that  state  wandered  away,  and  was  found  by 
some  peasants,  who  carried  him  to  their  king,  Mi'das.  Midas 
recognized  him  and  treated  him  hospitably,  entertaining  him  for 
ten  days  and  nights  with  an  unceasing  round  of  jollity.  On  the 
eleventh  day  he  brought  Silenus  back  and  restored  him  in  safety 
to  his  pupil.  Whereupon  Bacchus  offered  Midas  his  choice  of  a 
reward,  whatever  he  might  wish.  He  asked  that  whatever  he 
might  touch  should  be  changed  into  gohL  Bacchus  consented, 
though  sorry  that  he  had  not  made  a  better  choice.  Midas  went 
his  way,  rejoicing  in  his  newly-acquired  power,  which  he  hast- 
ened to  put  to  the  test.  He  could  scarcely  believe  his  eyes  when 
he  found  a  twig  of  an  oak,  which  he  plucked  from  the  branch, 
become  gold  in  his  hand.  He  took  up  a  stone ;  it  changed  to 
gold.  He  touched  a  sod  ;  it  did  the  same.  He  took  an  apple 
from  the  tree  ;  you  would  have  thought  he  had  robbed  the  gar* 
den  of  the  Hesperides.  His  joy  knew  no  bounds,  and  as  soon 
as  he  got  home  he  ordered  the  servants  to  set  a  splendid  repast 
on  the  table.  Then  he  found,  to  his  dismay,  that  whenever  he 
touched  bread,  it  hardened  in  his  hand,  or  put  a  morsel  to  his 
lips,  it  defied  his  teeth.  He  took  a  glass  of  wine,  but  it  flowed 
down  his  throat  like  melted  gold. 

In  consternation  at  the  unprecedented  affliction,  he  strove  t^ 
.divest  himself  of  his  power;  he  hated  the  gift  he  had  lateiy 
coveted.  But  all  in  vain  ;  starvation  seemed  to  await  him.  He 
raised  his  arms,  all  shining  with  gold,  in  prayer  to  Bacchus,  beg- 
ging to  be  delivered  from  his  glittering  destruction.  Bacchus, 
merciful  deity,  heard  and  consented.  **Go,**  said  he,  **to  the 
River  Pactolus,  trace  the  stream  to  its  fountain-head ;  there 
plunge  in  your  head  and  body,  and  wash  away  your  fault  and 
its  punishment."     He  did  so,  and  scarce  had  he  touched  the

waters  before  the  gold -creating  power  passed  into  them,  and  the 
river-sands  became  changed  '  :to  ,i^o/(/,  as  they  remain  to  this  day. 
Thenceforth  Midas,  hating  wealth  and  splendor,  dwelt  in  the 
country,  and  became  a  worshipper 
of  Pan,  the  god  of  the  fields.  On 
a  certain  occasion  Pan  had  the  te- 
merity to  compare  his  music  with 
that  of  Apollo,  and  to  challenge 
the  god  of  the  lyre  to  a  trial  of  j 
skill.  The  challenge  was  accepted, 
and  Tmolus,  the  mountain-god, 
was  chosen  umpire.  The  senior 
took  his  seat,  and  cleared  away  the 
trees  from  his  ears  to  listen.  At 
a  given  signal  Pan  blew  on  his 
pipes,  and  with  his  rustic  melody 
gave  great  satisfaction  to  himself 
and  his  faithful  follower,  Midas, 
who  happened  to  be  present.  Then 
Tmolus  turned  his  head  toward  the 
Sun-god,  and  all  his  trees  turned 
with  him.  Apollo  rose,  his  brow 
wreathed  with  Parnassian  laurel, 
while  his  robe  of  Tyrian  purple 
swept  the  ground.  In  his  left 
hand  he  held  the  lyre,  and  with 
his  right  hand  struck  the  strings. 
Ravished  with  the  harmony,  Tmo- 
lus at  once  awarded  the  victory  to  the  god  of  the  lyre,  and  all  but 
Midas  acquiesced  in  the  judgment.  He  dissented,  and  questioned 
the  justice  of  the  award.  Apollo  would  not  suffer  such  a  depraved 
pair  of  ears  any  longer  to  wear  the  human  form,  but  caused 
ihem  to  increase  in  length,  grow  hairy  within  and  without,  and 
movable  on  their  roots — in  short,  to  be  on  the  perfect  pattern  of 
those  of  an  ass.

62  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 

Mortified  enough  was  King  Midas  at  this  mishap ;  but  he  cop 
soled  himself  with  the  thought  that .''  /as  possible  to  hide  his  mis« 
fortune,  which  he  attempted  to  do  by  means  of  an  ample  turban 
or  head-dress.  But  his  hair-dresser,  of  course,  knew  the  secret. 
He  was  charged  not  to  mention  it,  and  threatened  with  dire  pun- 
ishment if  he  presumed  to  disobey.  But  he  found  it  too  much 
for  his  discretion  to  keep  such  a  secret ;  so  he  went  out  into  the 
meadow,  dug  a  hole  in  the  ground,  and  stooping  down,  whis- 
pered the  story,  and  covered  it  up.  Before  long  a  thick  bed  of 
reeds  sprang  up  in  the  meadow,  and  as  soon  as  it  had  gained  its 
growth,  began  whispering  the  story,  and  has  continued  to  do  so, 
from  that  day  to  this,  every  time  a  breeze  passes  over  the  place. 

The  story  of  King  Midas  has  been  told  by  others  with  some 
variations.  Dryden,  in  the  *' Wife  of  Bath's  Tale,"  makes 
Midas' s  queen  the  betrayer  of  the  secret. 

**  This  Midas  knew,  and  durst  communicate 
To  none  but  to  his  wife  his  ears  of  state. ' ' 

Midas  was  king  of  Phrygia.  He  was  the  son  of  Gordius,  a 
poor  countryman,  who  was  taken  by  the  people  and  made  king 
in  obedience  to  the  command  of  the  oracle,  which  had  said  that 
their  future  king  should  come  in  a  wagon.  While  the  people 
were  deliberating,  Gordius  with  his  wife  and  son  came  driving 
his  wagon  into  the  public  square. 

Gordius,  being  made  king,  dedicated  his  wagon  to  the  deity 
of  the  oracle,  and  tied  it  up  in  its  place  with  a  fast  knot.  This 
was  the  celebrated  Gordian  knot,  which,  in  after  times  it  was 
said,  whoever  should  untie  should  become  lord  of  all  Asia. 
Many  tried  to  untie  it,  but  none  succeeded  till  Alexander  the 
Great,  in  his  career  of  conquest,  came  to  Phrygia.  He  tried 
his  skill  with  as  ill  success  as  others,  till  growing  impatient  he 
drew  his  sword  and  cut  the  knot.  When  he  afterwards  suc- 
ceeded in  subjecting  all  Asia  to  his  sway,  people  began  to 
think  that  he  had  complied  with  the  terms  of  the  oracle  accord- 
ing to  its  true  meaning. 

Bau^cis  and  Phi-le'mon. 

On  a  certain  hill  in  Phrygia  stand  a  linden-tree  and  an  oak, 
enclosed  by  a  low  wall.     Not  far  from  the  spot  is  a  marsh,  for-

raerly  good  habitable  land,  but  now  indented  with  pools,  the  re 
sort  of  fen-birds  and  cormorants.  Once  on  a  time,  Jupiter,  in 
human  shape,  visited  this  country,  and  with  him  his  son  Mer 
cury  (he  of  the  caduceus),  without  his  wings.  They  presented 
themselves  as  weary  travellers  at  many  a  door,  seeking  rest  and 
shelter,  but  found  all  closed,  for  it  was  late  and  the  inhospitable 
inhabitants  would  not  rouse  themselves  to  open  for  their  recep 
tion.  At  last  a  humble  mansion  received  them,  a  small  thatched 
cottage,  where  Bau'cis,  a  pious  old  dame,  and  her  husband 
Phi-le'mon,  united  when  young,  had  grown  old  together.  Not 
ashamed  of  their  poverty,  they  made  it  endurable  by  moderate 
desires  and  kind  dispositions.  One  need  not  look  there  for 
master  or  for  servant ;  they  two  were  the  whole  household,  mas- 
ter and  servant  alike.  When  the  two  heavenly  guests  crossed 
the  humble  threshold,  and  bowed  their  heads  to  pass  under  the 
low  door,  the  old  man  placed  a  seat,  on  which  Baucis,  bustling 
and  attentive,  spread  a  cloth  and  begged  them  to  sit  down. 
Then  she  raked  out  the  coals  from  the  ashes  and  kindled  up  a 
fire,  fed  it  with  leaves  and  dry  bark,  and  with  her  scanty  breath 
blew  it  into  a  flame.  She  brought  out  of  a  corner  split  sticks 
and  dry  branches,  broke  them  up,  and  placed  them  under  the 
small  kettle.  Her  husband  collected  some  pot-herbs  in  the  gar- 
den, and  she  shred  them  from  the  stalks  and  prepared  them  for 
the  pot.  He  reached  down  with  a  forked  stick  a  flitch  of 
bacon  hanging  in  the  chimney,  cut  a  small  piece,  and  put  it  in 
the  pot  to  boil  with  the  herbs,  setting  away  the  rest  for  another 
lime.  A  beechen  bowl  was  filled  with  warm  water,  that  their 
guests  might  wash.  While  all  was  doing,  they  beguiled  the 
time  with  conversation. 

On  the  bench  designed  for  the  guests  was  laid  a  cushion  stuffed 
with  sea-weed,  and  a  cloth,  produced  only  on  great  occasions, 
but  ancient  and  coarse  enough,  was  spread  over  that.  The  old 
lady,  with  her  apron  on,  with  trembling  hand  set  the  table. 
One  leg  was  shorter  than  the  rest,  but  a  piece  of  slate  put  under 
restored  the  level.  When  fixed,  she  rubbed  the  table  down  with 
some  iweet-smelling  herbs.  Upon  it  she  set  some  of  chaste  Mi- 
nerva's olives,  some  cornel  berries  preserved  in  vinegar,  and 
added  radishes  and  cheese,  with  eggs  lightly  cooked  in  the 
ashes.     All  were  served  in  earthen  dishes,  and  an  earthenware

pitcher  with  wooden  cups  stood  beside  them.  When  all  was 
ready,  the  stew,  smoking-hot,  was  set  on  the  table.  Some  wine, 
not  of  the  oldest,  was  added ;  and  for  dessert,  apples  and  wild 
boney ;  and  over  and  above  all,  friendly  faces,  and  simple  but 
hearty  welcome. 

Now  while  the  repast  proceeded,  the  old  folks  were  astonished 
to  see  that  the  wine,  as  fast  as  it  was  poured  out,  renewed  itself 
in  the  pitcher,  of  its  own  accord.  Struck  with  terror,  Bauci? 
and  Philemon  recognized  their  heavenly  guests,  fell  on  theii 
knees,  and  with  clasped  hands  implored  forgiveness  for  their 
poor  entertainment.  There  was  an  old  goose,  which  they  kept 
as  the  guardian  of  their  humble  cottage ;  and  they  bethought 
them  to  make  this  a  sacrifice  in  honor  of  their  guests.  But  the 
goose,  too  nimble,  with  the  aid  of  feet  and  wings,  for  the  old 
folks,  eluded  their  pursuit,  and  at  last  took  shelter  between  the 
gods  themselves.  They  forbade  it  to  be  slain,  and  spoke  in  these 
words:  ^*  We  are  gods.  This  inhospitable  village  shall  pay  the 
penalty  of  its  impiety  ;  you  alone  shall  go  free  from  the  chastise- 
ment. Quit  your  house,  and  come  with  us  to  the  top  of  yonder 
hill."  They  hastened  to  obey,  and,  staff  in  hand,  labored  up 
the  steep  ascent.  They  had  reached  to  within  an  arrow's  flight 
of  the  top,  when,  turning  theiT  eyes  below,  they  beheld  all 
the  country  sunk  in  a  lake,  only  their  own  house  left  standing. 
While  they  gazed  with  wonder  at  the  sight,  and  lamented  the 
fate  of  their  neighbors,  that  old  house  of  theirs  was  changed  into 
a  temple.  Columns  took  the  place  of  the  corner-posts,  the  thatch 
grew  yellow  and  appeared  a  gilded  roof,  the  floors  became  mar^ 
ble,  the  doors  were  enriched  with  carving  and  ornaments  of  gold. 

**  Their  little  shed,  scarce  large  enough  for  two, 
Seems,  from  the  ^ound  increased,  in  lieight  and  bulk  to  groiv . 
A  stately  temple  shoots  within  the  skies, 
The  crotches  of  their  cot  in  columns  rise ; 
The  pavement  polish' d  marble  they  behold. 
The  gates,  with  sculpture  grac'd,  the  spires  and  tiles  of  gold." 

— Ovid  (Diyden's  tr.). 

Then  spoke  Jupiter,  in  benignant  accents:  *' Excellent  old 
man,  and  woman  worthy  of  such  a  husband,  speak ;  tell  us  your 
wishes ;  what  favor  have  you  to  ask  of  us  ?' '  Philemon  took 
counsel  with  Baucis  a  few  moments,  then  declared  to  the  god«

thefr  united  wish.  **  We  ask  to  be  priests  and  guardians  of  this 
your  temple ;  and  since  here  we  have  passed  our  Uves  in  love 
and  concord,  we  wish  that  one  and  the  same  hour  may  take  us 
both  from  life,  that  I  may  not  live  to  see  her  grave,  nor  be  laid 
in  my  own  by  her. ' '  Their  prayer  was  granted.  They  were  the 
keepers  of  the  temple  as  long  as  they  lived.  When  grown  very 
old,  as  they  stood  one  day  before  the  steps  of  the  sacred  edifice, 
and  were  telling  the  story  of  the  place,  Baucis  saw  Philemon 
beginning  to  put  forth  leaves,  and  old  Philemon  saw  Baucis 
changing  in  like  manner.  And  now  a  leafy  crown  had  grown 
over  their  heads,  while  exchanging  parting  words  as  long  as  they 
could  speak.  **  Farewell,  dear  spouse,'*  they  said,  together,  and 
at  the  same  moment  the  bark  closed  over  their  mouths.  •  The 
Tyanean  shepherd  still  shows  the  two  trees,  standing  side  by 
side,  made  out  of  the  two  good  old  people. 

The  story  of  Baucis  and  Philemon  has  been  imitated  by  Swift 
in  a  burlesque  style,  the  actors  in  the  change  being  two  wander- 
ing saints,  and  the  house  being  changed  into  a  church,  of  which 
Philemon  is  made  the  parson.  The  following  may  serve  as  a 
specimen : 

"  They  scarce  had  spoke,  when,  fair  and  soft. 
The  roof  began  to  mount  aloft ; 
Aloft  rose  every  beam  and  rafter ; 
The  heavy  wall  climbed  slowly  after. 
The  chimney  widened  and  grew  higher, 
Became  a  steeple  with  a  spire. 
The  kettle  to  the  top  was  hoist, 

And  there  stood  fastened  to  a  joist,  > 

But  with  the  upside  down,  to  show 
Its  inclination  for  below  ; 
In  vain,  for  a  superior  force, 
Applied  at  bottom,  stops  its  course ; 
Doomed  ever  in  suspense  to  dwell, 
*Tis  now  no  kettle,  but  a  bell."

CHAPTER  VII. 
A*ro-ser'pi-ne,  Ce'res,  Glau'cus  and  Scyl'la* 

When  Jupiter  and  his  brothers  had  defeated  the  Titans  anr) 
Vanished  them  to  Tartarus,  a  new  enemy  rose  up  against  the  gods. 

They  were  the  giants  Typhon, 
Briareus,  Enceladus  and  others. 
Some  of  them  had  a  hundred  arms, 
others  breathed  out  fire.  They 
were  finally  subdued  and  buried 
alive  under  Mount  ^tna,  where 
they  still  sometimes  struggle  to 
gat  loose,  and  shake  the  whole 
island  with  earthquakes.  Their 
breath  comes  up  through  the  moun- 
tain, and  is  what  men  call  the 
eruption  of  the  volcano. 

The  fall  of  these  monsters  shook 
the  earth,  so  that  Pluto  was 
alarmed,  and  feared  that  his  king- 
dom would  be  laid  open  to  the  , 
light  of  day.  Under  this  appre- 
hension he  mounted  his  chariot, 
drawn  by  black  horses,  and  took 
a  circuit  of  inspection  to  satisfy 
himself  of  the  extent  of  the  dam- 
age. While  he  was  thus  engaged, 
Venus,  who  was  sitting  on  Mount 
Eryx,  playing  with  her  boy,  Cupid, 
espied  him,  and  said,  **My  son, 
take  your  darts  with  which  you 
conquer  all,  even  Jove  himself, 
and  send  one  into  the  breast  of 
yonder  dark  monarch,  who  rules 
the  realm  of  Tartarus.       Why  should  he  alone  escape?    Seize

the  opportunity  to  extend  your  empire  and  mine.  Do  you  not 
see  that  even  in  heaven  some 
despise  our  power?  Minerva 
the  wise  and  Diana  the  hunt- 
ress defy  us ;  and  there  is  that 
daughter  of  Ceres, who  threat- 
ens to  follow  their  example. 
Now,  do  you,  if  you  have  any 
regard  for  your  own  interest  or 
mine,  join  these  two  in  one." 
The  boy  unbound  his  quiver, 
and  selected  his  sharpest  and 
truest  arrow;  then,  straining 
the  bow  against  his  knee,  he 
attached  the  string,  and,  hav- 
ing made  ready,  shot  the  ar- 
row with  its  barbed  point  right 
into  the  heart  of  Pluto. 

In  the  vale  of  Enna  there 
is  a  lake  embowered  in  woods, 
which  screen  it  from  the  fervid 
rays  of  the  sun,  while  the  moist 
ground  is  covered  with  flow- 
ers, and  Spring  reigns  perpet- 
ual. Here  Pro-ser'pi-ne  was 
playing  with  her  companions,  gathering  lilies  and  violets,  and 
filling  her  basket  and  her  apron  with  them.

Gods  and  men  and  beasts  have  birth.

Pluto  saw  her,  loved  her,  and  carried  her  off.     She  screamed 

for  help  to  her  mother  and  her  companions,  and  when,  in  hef 

fright-,  she  dropped  the  corners  of  her  apron  and  let  the  flowers 

fall,  childlike,  she  felt  the  loss  of  them  as  an  addition  to  her 

grief.

The  ravisher  urged  on  his  steeds,  calling  them  each  by  name, 
and  throwing  loose  over  their  heads  and  necks  his  iron-colored 
reins.  When  he  reached  the  River  Cyane,  and  it  opposed  his 
passage,  he  struck  the  river-bank  with  his  trident,  and  the  earth 
opened  and  gave  him  a  passage  to  Tartarus.

But  it  was  unavailing.  At  length,  weary  and  sad,  she  sat 
down  upon  a  stone,  and  continued  sitting  nine  days  and  nights, 
in  the  open  air,  under  the  sunlight  and  moonlight  and  falling 
showers.  It  was  where  now  stands  the  city  of  Eleusis,,  then  the 
home  of  an  old  man  named  Celeus.

PROSERPINE.

He  was  out  in  the  field,  gathering  acorns  and  blackberries, 
and  sticks  for  his  fire.  His  little  girl  was  driving  home  their 
two  goats,  and  as  she  passed  the  goddess,  who  appeared  in  the 
guise  of  an  old  woman,  she  said  to  her,  **  Mother  "—and  the 
name  was  sweet  to  the  ears  of 
Ceres — **why  do  you  sit  here 
alone  upon  the  rocks?"  The 
old  man  also  stopped,  though 
his  load  was  heavy,  and  begged 
her  to  come  into  his  cottage, 
such  as  it  was.  She  declined,  and 
he  urged  her.  **  Go  in  peace," 
she  replied,  **and  be  happy  in 
your  daughter ;  I  have  lost 
mine."  As  she  spoke,  tears — • 
or  something  like  tears,  for  the 
gods  never  weep — fell  down  her 
cheeks  upon  her  bosom.  The 
compassionate  old  man  and  his 
child  wept  with  her.  Then  said 
he,  *'  Come  with  us,  and  despise 
not  our  humble  roof;  so  may 
your  daughter  be  restored  to  you 
in  safety."  *'Lead  on,"  said 
she,  *'  I  cannot  resist  that  ap- 
peal!"  So  she  rose  from  the 
stone  and  went  with  them.  As 
they  walked  he  told  her  that  his 
only  son,  a  little  boy,  lay  very 
sick,  feverish  and  sleepless.    She

Stooped  and  gathered  some  poppies.  As  they  entered  the  cottage 
they  found  all  in  great  distress,  for  the  boy  seemed  past  hope  of 
recovery.  Metanira,  his  mother,  received  her  kindly,  and  tie

The  whole  family  were  delighted — that  is,  the  father,  mother,  and 
little  girl,  for  they  were  all ;  they  had  no  servants.  They  spread 
the  table,  and  put  upon  it  curds  and  cream,  apples,  and  honey  in 
the  comb.     While  they  ate,  Ceres  mingled  poppy  juice  in  th^

the  child  from  the  fire.  Then  Ceres  assumed  her  own  form,  and 
a  divine  splendor  shone  all  around,  ^ 


FEOSEBPINE.  71 

**  From  her  fragrant  robes 
A  lovely  scent  was  scattered,  and  afar 
Shone  light  emitted  from  her  skin  divine, 
And  yellow  locks  upon  her  shoulders  waved  ; 
White  as  from  lightning,  all  the  house  was  filled 
With  splendor." — Homeric  Hymn. 

While  they  were  orercome  with  astonishment,  she  said, 
"  Mother,  you  have  been  cruel,  in  your  fondness,  to  your  son.  I 
would  have  made  him  immortal,  but  you  have  frustrated  my  at- 
tempt. Nevertheless,  he  shall  be  great  and  useful.  He  shall 
teach  men  the  use  of  the  plough,  and  the  rewards  which  labor 
can  win  from  the  cultivated  soil."  So  saying,  she  wrapped  ^ 
cloud  about  her,  and  mounting  her  chariot  rode  away. 

Ceres  continued  her  search  for  her  daughter,  passing  from  land 
to  land,  and  across  seas  and  rivers,  till  at  length  she  returned  to 
Sicily,  whence  she  at  first  set  out,  and  stood  by  the  banks  of  the 
River  Cyane,  where  Pluto  made  himself  a  passage  with  his  prize 
to  his  own  dominions.  The  river  nymph  would  have  told  the 
goddess  all  she  had  witnessed,  but  dared  not,  for  fear  of  Pluto  ; 
so  she  only  ventured  to  take  up  the  girdle  which  Proserpine  had 
dropped  in  her  flight,  and  waft  it  to  the  feet  of  the  mother. 
Ceres,  seeing  this,  was  no  longer  in  doubt  of  her  loss,  but  she 
did  not  yet  know  the  cause,  and  laid  the  blame  on  the  innocent 
land.  **  Ungrateful  soil,"  said  she,  *' which  I  have  endowed 
with  fertility  and  clothed  with  herbage  and  nourishing  grain,  no 
more  shall  you  enjoy  my  favors."  Then  the  cattle  died,  the 
plough  broke  in  the  furrow,  the  seed  failed  to  come  up ;  there 
was  too  much  sun,  there  was  too  much  rain  ;  the  birds  stole  the 
seeds — thistles  and  brambles  were  the  only  growth.  Seeing  this, 
the  fountain  Arethusa  interceded  for  the  land.  *' Goddess," 
said  she,  ** blame  not  the  land;  it  opened  unwillingly  to  yield 
a  passage  to  your  daughter.  I  can  tell  you  of  her  fate,  for  I 
have  seen  her.  This  is  not  my  native  country  ;  I  came  hither 
from  Elis.  I  was  a  woodland  nymph,  and  delighted  in  the  chase. 
They  praised  my  beauty,  but  I  cared  nothing  for  it,  and  rather 
boasted  of  my  hunting  exploits.  One  day  I  was  returning  from 
the  wood,  heated  with  exercise,  when  I  came  to  a  stream  silently 
flowing,  sa  clear  that  you  might  count  the  pebbles  on  the  bottom. 
The  willows  shaded  it,  and  the  grassy  bank  sloped  down  to  the

water  I  heard  an  indistinct  murmur  coming  up  as  out  of  the 
depths  of  the  stream,  and  made  haste  to  escape  to  the  nearest 
bank.     The  voice  said,  '  Why  do  you  fly,  Arethusa?     I  am  \1-

how  I  trembled — like  a  lamb  that  hears  the  wolf  growling  out 
side  the  fold.  A  cold  sweat  came  over  me,  my  hair  flowed  down 
in  streams ;  where  my  foot  stood  there  was  a  pool.  In  short,  in 
less  time  than  it  takes  to  tell  it  I  became  a  fountain.  But  in 
this  form  Alpheus  knew  me,  and  attempted  to  mingle  his  stream 
with  mine. 

**  O  Arethusa,  peerless  nympb  1  wliy  fear 
Such  tenderness  as  mine  ?     Great  Dian,  why. 
Why  didst  thou  hear  her  prayer  ?    Oh  that  I 
Were  rippling  round  her  dainty  fairness  now. 
Circling  about  her  waist,  and  striving  how 
To  entice  her  to  a  dive  !  then  stealing  in 
Between  her  luscious  lips  and  eyelids  thin.-" — KeatS. 

*'  Diana  cleft  the  ground,  and  I,  endeavoring  to  escape  him^ 
plunged  into  the  cavern,  and  through  the  bowels  of  the  earth 
came  out  here  in  Sicily.  While  I  passed  through  the  lower  parts 
of  the  earth  I  saw  your  Proserpine.  She  was  sad,  but  no  longer 
showing  alarm  in  her  countenance.  Her  look  was  such  as  be- 
came a  queen — the  queen  of  Erebus ;  the  powerful  bride  of  the 
monarch  of  the  realms  of  the  dead.** 

When  Ceres  heard  this  she  stood  for  a  while  like  one  stupefied, 
then  turned  her  chariot  towards  heaven  and  hastened  to  present 
herself  before  the  throne  of  Jove.  She  told  the  story  of  her 
bereavement,  and  implored  Jupiter  to  interfere  to  procure  the 
restitution  of  her  daughter. 

**  Arise,  and  set  the  maiden  free  ; 
Why  should  the  worid  such  sorrow  dree 
By  reason  of  Persephone  ?" — Ingelow. 

Jupiter  consented  on  one  condition,  namely,  that  Proserpine 
should  not  during  her  stay  in  the  lower  world  have  taken  any 
food ;  otherwise,  the  Fates  forbade  her  release.     Accordingly, 
Mercury  was  sent,  accompanied  by  Spring,  to  demand  Prosei 
pine  of  Pluto. 

**  Last,  Zeus  himself. 
Pitying  the  evil  that  was  done,  sent  forth 
His  messenger  beyond  the  western  rim 
To  fetch  me  back  to  earth." — Lewis  xVIorris. 

The  wily  monarch  consented  ;  but  alas !  the  maiden  had  taken

a  pomegranate  which  Pluto  offered  her,  and  had  sucked  the  sweet 
puip  from  a  few  of  the  seeds.  This  was  enough  to  prevent  her 
complete  release ;  but  a  compromise  was  made,  by  which  she 
was  to  pass  half  the  time  with  her  mother,  and  the  rest  with  hei 
husband  Pluto. 

Ceres  allowed  herself  to  be  pacified  with  this  arrangement, 
and  restored  the  earth  to  her  favor.  Now  she  remembered  Celeui 
and  his  family,  and  her  promise  to  his  infant  son  Triptolemus. 
When  the  boy  grew  up,  she  taught  him  the  use  of  the  plough, 
and  how  to  sow  the  seed.  She  took  him  in  her  chariot,  drawn 
by  winged  dragons,  through  all  the  countries  of  the  earth,  im- 
parting to  mankind  valuable  grains,  and  the  knowledge  of  agri- 
culture. After  his  return,  Triptolemus  built  a  magnificent  tem- 
ple to  Ceres  in  Eleusis,  and  established  the  worship  of  the  god- 
dess, under  the  name  of  the  Eleusinian  mysteries,  which,  in  the 
splendor  and  solemnity  of  their  observance,  surpassed  all  other 
religious  celebrations  among  the  Greeks. 

There  can  be  little  doubt  of  this  story  of  Ceres  and  Proserpine 
being  an  allegory.  Proserpine  signifies  the  seed-corn  which 
when  cast  into  the  ground  lies  there  concealed, — that  is,  she  is 
carried  off  by  the  god  of  the  underworld  ;  it  reappears, — that  is, 
Proserpine  is  restored  to  her  mother.  Spring  leads  her  back  to 
the  light  of  day. 

"  And  when,  in  springtime,  with  sweet-smelling  flowers 
Of  various  kinds  the  earth  doth  bloom,  thoul'  t  come 
From  gloomy  darkness  back — a  mighty  joy 
To  gods  and  mortal  men." — Homeric  Hymn. 

Milton  alludes  to  the  story  o/ Proserpine  in  '•  Paradise  Lost,** 
Book  IV. :—  » 

**  Not  that  fair  field 
Of  Enna  where  Proserpine  gathering  flowers.

The  River  Alpheus  does  in  fact  disappear  under  ground,  in 
part  of  its  course,  finding  its  way  through  subterranean  channelSj 
till  it  again  appears  on  the  surface.  It  was  said  that  the  Sicilian 
fountain  Arethusa  was  the  same  stream,  which,  after  passing 
under  the  sea,  came  up  again  in  Sicily.  Hence  the  story  ran 
that  a  cup  thrown  into  the  Alpheus  appeared  again  in  Arethusa. 
It  is  this  fable  of  the  underground  course  of  Alpheus  that  Cole

»       Glau'cus  and  Scyl'la. 

Glau'cus  was  a  fisherman.  One  day  he  had  drawn  his  net 
to  land,  and  had  taken  a  great  many  fishes  of  various  kinds.  So 
ha  emptied  his  net,  and  proceeded  to  sort  the  fishes  on  the  grass. 
The  place  where  he  stood  was  a  beautiful  island  in  the  river,  a 
solitary  spot,  uninhabited,  and  not  used  for  pasturage  of  cattle, 
nor  ever  visited  by  any  but  himself.  On  a  sudden,  the  fishes, 
which  had  been  laid  on  the  grass,  began  to  revive  and  move 
their  fins  as  if  they  were  in  the  water ;  and  while  he  looked  on 
astonished,  they  one  and  all  moved  off  to  the  water,  plunged  in 
and  swam  away.  He  did  not  know  what  to  make  of  this, 
whether  some  god  had  done  it,  or  some  secret  power  in  the 
herbage.  "  What  herb  has  such  a  power?"  he  exclaimed  ;  and 
gathering  some  of  it,  he  tasted  it.  Scarce  had  the  juices  of  the 
plant  reached  his  palate  when  he  found  himself  agitated  with  a 
longing  desire  for  the  water.  He  could  no  longer  restrain  him- 
self, but  bidding  farewell  to  earth,  he  plunged  into  the  stream. 
The  gods  of  the  water  received  him  graciously,  and  admitted 
him  to  the  honor  of  their  society.  They  obtained  the  consent 
0/  Oceanus  and  Tethys,  the  sovereigns  of  the  sea,  that  all  that

poured  their  waters  over  him.  Then  he  lost  all  sense  of  hn 
former  nature  and  all  consciousness.  When  he  recovered  he 
found  himself  changed  in  form  and  mind.  His  hair  was  sea- 
green,  and  trailed  behind  him  on  the  water ;  his  shoulders  gre\* 
broad,  and  what  had  been  thighs  and  legs  assumed  the  form  of  a 
fish's  tail.  The  sea- gods  complimented  him  on  the  change  of 
his  appearance,  and  he  fancied  himself  rather  a  good-lookinf 
personage. 

"  At  first  I  dwelt 
Whole  days  and  days  in  sheer  astonishment ; 
Moving  but  with  the  mighty  ebb  and  flow. 
Then,  like  a  new-fledg'd  bird  that  first  doth  show 
His  spreaded  feathers  to  the  morrow  chil. 
I  try'd  in  fear  the  pinions  of  my  will. 
*Twas  freedom  !  and  at  once  I  visited 
The  ceaseless  wonders  of  this  ocean-bed." — Keats. 

One  day  Glaucus  saw  the  beautiful  maiden  Scyl'la,  the  fa- 
vorite of  the  water-nymphs,  rambling  on  the  shore,  and  when 
she  had  found  a  sheltered  nook,  laving  her  limbs  in  the  clear 
water.  He  fell  in  love  with  her,  and  showing  himself  on  the 
surface,  spoke  to  her,  saying  such  things  as  he  thought  most 
likely  to  win  her  to  stay ;  for  she  turned  to  run  immediately  on 
the  sight  of  him,  and  ran  till  she  had  gained  a  cliff  overlooking 
the  sea.  Here  she  stopped  and  turned  around  to  see  whether 
it  was  a  god  or  a  sea -animal,  and  observed  with  wonder  his 
shape  and  color.  Glaucus,  partly  emerging  from  the  water  and 
supporting  himself  against  a  rock,  said,  **  Maiden,  I  am  no  mon- 
ster, nor  a  sea-animal,  but  a  god,  and  neither  Proteus  nor  Tri- 
ton ranks  higher  than  I.  Once  I  was  a  mortal,  and  followed 
the  sea  for  a  living;  but  now  I  belong  wholly  to  it."  Then  he 
told  the  story  of  his  metamorphosis,  and  how  he  had  been  pro- 
moted to  his  present  dignity,  and  added,  **  But  what  avails  all 
this  if  it  fails  to  move  your  heart?"  He  was  going  on  in  this 
strain,  but  Scylla  turned  and  hastened  away. 

Glaucus  was  in  despair,  but  it  occurred  to  him  to  consult  the 
enchantress,  Circe.  Accordingly  he  repaired  to  her  island — the 
same  where  afterwards  Ulysses  landed,  as  we  shall  see  in  one  of 
our  later  stories.  After  mutual  salutations  he  said,  **  Goddess, 
1  entreat  your  pity  ;  you  alone  can  relieve  the  pain  I  suffer.  The 
power  of  herbs  I  know  as  well  as  anyone,  for  it  is  to  them  I  owo

my  change  of  fomi.  I  love  Scylla.  I  am  ashamed  to  tell  you 
how  I  have  sued  and  promised  to  her,  and  how  scornfully  she 
has  treated  me.  I  beseech  you  to  use  your  incantations,  oi 
potent  herbs,  if  they  are  more  prevailing,  not  to  cure  me  of  my 

love for  that  I  do  not  wish — but  to  make  her  share  it  and  yield 

me  a,  like  return."  To  which  Circe  replied — for  she  was  not 
insensible  to  the  attractions  of  the  sea-green  deity — ''You  had 
better  pursue  a  willing  object ;  you  are  worthy  to  be  sought,  in- 
stead of  having  to  seek  in  vain.  Be  not  diffident ;  know  your 
own  worth.  I  protest  to  you  that  even  I,  goddess  though  I  be, 
and  learned  in  the  virtues  of  plants  and  spells,  should  not  know 
how  to  refuse  you.  If  she  scorns  you,  scorn  her ;  meet  one  who 
is  ready  to  meet  you  half-way,  and  thus  make  a  due  return  to 
both  at  once. '  *  To  these  words  Glaucus  replied,  * '  Sooner  shall 
trees  grow  at  the  bottom  of  the  ocean,  and  seaweed  on  the  top  of 
the  mountains,  than  I  will  cease  to  love  Scylla,  and  her  alone. ' ' 
The  goddess  was  indignant,  but  she  could  not  punish  him, 
neither  did  she  wish  to  do  so,  for  she  liked  him  too  well ;  so 
she  turned  all  her  wrath  against  her  rival,  poor  Scylla.  She 
took  plants  of  poisonous  powers  and  mixed  them  together,  with 
incantations  and  charms.  Then  she  passed  through  the  crowd 
of  gambolling  beasts,  the  victims  of  her  art,  and  proceeded  to 
the  coast  of  Sicily,  where  Scylla  lived.  There  was  a  little  bay 
on  the  shore  to  which  Scylla  used  to  resort,  in  the  heat  of  the 
day,  to  breathe  the  air  of  the  sea  and  to  bathe  in  its  waters. 
Here  the  goddess  poured  her  poisonous  mixture,  and  muttered 
over  it  incantations  of  mighty  power.  Scylla  came  as  usual,  and 
plunged  into  the  water  up  to  her  waist.  What  was  her  horror  to 
perceive  a  brood  of  serpents  and  barking  monsters  surrounding 
her  1  At  first  she  could  not  imagine  they  were  a  part  of  herself, 
and  tried  to  run  from  them  and  to  drive  them  away ;  but  as  she 
ran  she  carried  them  with  her,  and  when  she  tried  to  touch  her 
limbs,  she  found  her  hands  touch  only  the  yawning  jaws  of  mon- 
sters. Scylla  remained  rooted  to  the  spot.  Her  temper  grew 
as  ugly  as  her  form,  and  she  took  pleasure  in  devouring  hapless 
mariners  who  came  within  her  grasp.  Thus  she  destroyed  six 
of  the  companions  of  Ulysses,  and  tried  to  wreck  the  ships  of 
JEneaSf  till  at  last  she  was  turned  into  a  rock,  and  as  such  still 
continues  to  be  a  terror  to  mariners. 


^8  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES. 

Keats,  in  his  **  Endymion,"  has  given  a  new  version  of  the 
ending  of  **Glaucus  and  Scylla."  Glaucus  consents  to  Circe's 
blandishments,  till  he,  by  chance,  is  witness  to  her  transactions 
with  her  beasts.  Disgusted  with  her  treachery  and  cruelty,  he 
tries  to  escape  from  her,  but  is  tiken  and  brought  back,  when 
with  reproaches  she  banishes  him,  sentencing  him  to  pass  a  thou- 
sand years  in  decrepitude  and  pain.  He  returns  to  the  sea,  and 
there  finds  the  body  of  Scylla,  whom  the  goddess  has  not  trans- 
formed but  drowned.  Glaucus  learns  that  his  destiny  is  that,  if 
he  passes  his  thousand  years  in  collecting  all  the  bodies  of 
drowned  lovers,  a  youth  beloved  of  the  gods  will  appear  and 
help  him.  Endymion  fulfils  this  prophecy,  and  aids  in  restoring 
Glaucus  to  youth,  and  Scylla  and  all  the   drowned  lovers  to  life.

CHAPTER  VIII. 

Pyg-ma'li-on — Dry'o-pe — Ve'nus  and  A-do'nis — 
A-pol'lo  and  Hy-a-cin'thus. 

Pyg-ma'li-on  was  a  bachelor  god.  He  saw  so  much  to  blame 
»n  women  that  he  came  at  last  to  abhor  the  sex,  and  resolved  to 
live  unmarried.  He  was  a  sculptor,  and  had  made  with  wonder- 
ful skill  a  statue  of  ivory,  so  beautiful  that  no  living  woman  came 
anywhere  near  it.  It  was  indeed  the  perfect  semblance  of  a 
maiden  that  seemed  to  be  alive,  and  only  prevented  from  moving 
by  modesty.  His  art  was  so  perfect  that  it  concealed  itself,  and 
its  product  looked  like  the  workmanship  of  nature.  Pygmalion 
admired  his  own  work,  and  at  last  fell  in  love  with  the  counter- 
feit creation.  Oftentimes  he  laid  his  hand  upon  it  as  if  to  assure 
himself  whether  it  were  living  or  not,  and  could  not  even  then, 
believe  that  it  was  only  ivory.  He  caressed  it,  and  gave  it  pres- 
ents such  as  young  girls  love — bright  shells  and  polished  stones, 
ittie  birds  and  flowers  of  various  hues,  beads  and  amber.  He 
put  raiment  on  its  limbs,  and  jewels  on  its  fingers,  and  a  neck- 
lace about  its  neck.  To  the  ears  he  hung  ear-rings,  and  strings 
of  pearls  upon  the  breast.  Her  dress  became  her,  and  she  looked 
not  less  charming  than  when  unattired.  He  laid  her  on  a  couch 
spread  with  cloths  of  Tyrian  dye,  and  called  her  his  wife,  and 
put  her  head  upon  a  pillow  of  the  softest  feathcris.

So  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 

The  festival  of  Ve'nus  was  at  hand — a  festival  celebrated  with 
great  pomp  at  Cyprus.  Victims  were  offered,  the  altars  smoked, 
and  the  odor  of  incense  filled  the  air.  When  Pygmalion  had 
performed  his  part  in  the  solemnities,  he  stood  before  the  altar 
and  timidly  said,  ''Ye  gods,  who  can  do  all  things,  give  me,  I 
pray  you,  for  my  wife  " — he  dared  not  say  "my  ivory  virgin," 
but  said  instead — "one  like  my  ivory  virgin."  Venus,  who  was 
present  at  the  festival,  heard  him  and  knew  the  thought  he  would 
have  uttered ;  and  as  an  omen  of  her  favor,  caused  the  flame  on 
the  altar  to  shoot  up  thrice  in  a  fiery  point  into  the  air.  When 
he  returned  home  he  went  to  see  his  statue,  and  leaning  over 
the  couch,  gave  a  kiss  to  the  mouth.  It  seemed  to  be  warm. 
He  pressed  its  lips  again,  he  laid  his  hand  upon  the  limbs ;  the 
ivory  felt  soft  to  his  touch,  and  yielded  to  his  fingers  like  the 
wax  of  Hymettus.  While  he  stands  astonished  and  glad,  though 
doubting,  and  fears  he  may  be  mistaken,  again  and  again,  with  a 
lover's  ardor,  he  touches  the  object  of  his  hopes. 

**  Yet  while  he  stood  and  knew  not  what  to  do, 
With  yearning,  a  strange  thrill  of  hope  there  came, 
A  shaft  of  new  desire  now  pierced  him  through. 
And  there  withal  a  soft  voice  called  his  name ; 
And  when  he  turned  with  eager  eyes  aflame, 
He  saw  betwixt  him  and  the  setting  sun 
The  lively  image  of  his  loved  one." — William  Morris. 

It  was  indeed  alive  !  The  veins  when  pressed  yielded  to  the 
finger  and  again  resumed  their  roundness.  Then  at  last  the  votary 
of  Venus  found  words  to  thank  the  goddess,  and  pressed  his  lips 
upon  lips  as  real  as  his  own.  The  virgin  felt  the  kisses  and 
blushed,  and  opening  her  timid  eyes  to  the  light,  fixed  them  at 
the  same  moment  on  her  lover.  Venus  blessed  the  nuptials  she 
had  formed,  and  from  this  union  Paphos  was  born,  from  whom 
the  city,  sacred  to  Venus,  received  its  name.  « 

Schiller,  in  his  poem  the  "Ideals,"  applies  this  tale  of  Pyg- 
!Tialion  to  the  love  of  nature  in  a  youthful  heart.  The  following 
translation  is  furnished  by  a  friend : — 

•*  As  once  with  prayers  in  passion  flowing, 
Pygmalion  embraced  the  stone. 
Till  from  the  frozen  marble  glowing,

DRY  OPE.  8 1 

So  did  I  clasp  with  young  devotion 

Bright  nature  to  a  poet's  heart, 
Till  breath  and  warmth  and  vital  motion 

Seemed  through  the  statue  form  to  dart. 

"And  then,  in  all  my  ardor  sharing, 
The  silent  fonn  expression  found  ; 
Returned  my  kiss  of  youthful  daring, 

And  understood  my  heart's  quick  sound.  * 

Then  lived  for  me  the  bright  creation, 
The  silver  rill  with  song  was  rife  ; 
The  trees,  the  roses,  shared  sensation, 
An  echo  of  my  boundless  life." 

Dry'o-pe. 
Dry'o-pe  and  I'o-le  were  sisters.  The  former  was  the  wife 
of  Androemon,  beloved  by  her  husband,  and  happy  in  the  birth 
of  her  first  child.  One  day  the  sisters  strolled  to  the  bank  of 
a  stream  that  sloped  gradually  down  to  the  water's  edge,  while 
the  upland  was  overgrown  with  myrtles. 

**  A  lake  there  was,  with  shelving  banks  around, 
Whose  verdant  summit  fragiant  myrtles  crown' d. 
Those  shades,  unknowing  of  the  Fates,  she  sought. 
And  to  the  Naiads  flowery  garlands  brought ; 
Her  smiling  babe  (a  pleasing  charge)  she  press'd 
Between  her  arms." — Ovid  (Pope's  tr. ). 

They  were  intending  to  gather  flowers  for  forming  garlands 
for  the  altars  of  the  nymphs,  and  Dryope  carried  her  child  at 
her  bosom,  a  precious  burden,  and  nursed  him  as  she  walked. 
Near  the  water  grew  a  lotus  plant,  full  of  purple  flowers.  Dry- 
ope gathered  some  and  off'ered  them  to  the  baby,  and  lole  was 
about  to  do  the  same,  when  she  perceived  blood  dropping  from 
the  places  where  her  sister  had  broken  them  off"  the  stem.  The 
plant  was  no  other  than  the  Nymph  Lotis,  who,  running  from  a 
base  pursuer,  had  been  changed  into  this  form.  This  they 
learned  from  the  country  people  when  it  was  too  late. 

*'  Lotis  the  nymph  (if  rural  tales  be  true), 
As  from  Priapus'  lawless  love  she  flew, 
Forsook  her  form  ;  and  fixing  here  became 
A  flowery  plant,  which  still  preserves  her  name." 

—Ovid  (Pope's  tr,). 

Dryope,  horror-struck  when  she  perceived  what  she  had  done,

would  gladly  have  hastened  from  the  spot,  but  found  her  fee\ 
rooted  to  the  ground.  She  tried  to  pull  them  away,  but  moved 
nothing  but  her  upper  limbs.  The  woodiness  crept  upward, 
and  by  degrees  invested  her  body.  In  anguish  she  attempted  to 
tear  her  hair,  but  found  her  hands  filled  with  leaves.  The  infant 
felt  his  mother's  bosom  begin  to  harden,  and  the  milk  cease  to 
flow.  lole  looked  on  at  the  sad  fate  of  her  sister,  and  could 
render  no  assistance.  She  embraced  the  growing  trunk,  as  if 
she  would  hold  back  the  advancing  wood,  and  would  gladly 
have  been  enveloped  in  the  same  bark.  At  this  moment,  An- 
draernon,  the  husband  of  Dryope,  with  her  father,  approached ; 
and  when  they  asked  for  Dryope,  lole  pointed  them  to  the  new- 
formed  lotus.  They  embraced  the  trunk  of  the  yet  warm  tree, 
and  showered  their  kisses  on  its  leaves. 

Now  there  was  nothing  left  of  Dryope  but  her  face.  Her 
tears  itill  flowed  and  fell  on  her  leaves,  and  while  she  could  she 
spoke.  *'  I  am  not  guilty.  I  deserve  not  this  fate.  I  have  in- 
jured no  one.  If  I  speak  falsely,  may  my  foliage  perish  with 
drought  and  my  trunk  be  cut  down  and  burned.  Take  this  in- 
fant and  give  it  to  a  nurse.  Let  it  often  be  brought  and  nursed 
under  my  branches,  and  play  in  my  shade ;  and  when  he  is  old 
enough  to  talk,  let  him  be  taught  to  call  me  mother,  and  to  say 
with  sadness  *  My  mother  lies  hid  under  this  bark.*  But  bid 
him  be  careful  of  river  banks,  and  beware  how  he  plucks  flowers, 
remembering  that  every  bush  he  sees  may  be  a  goddess  in  dis- 
guise. Farewell,  dear  husband,  and  sister,  and  father.  If  you 
retain  any  love  for  me,  let  not  the  axe  wound  me,  nor  the  flocks 
bite  and  tear  my  branches.  Since  I  cannot  stoop  to  you,  climb 
up  hither  and  kiss  me ;  and  while  my  lips  continue  to  feel,  lift 
up  my  child  that  I  may  kiss  him.  I  can  speak  no  more,  for 
rfready  the  bark  advances  up  my  neck,  and  will  soon  shoot  over 
me.  You  need  not  close  my  eyes ;  the  bark  will  close  them 
without  your  aid."  Then  the  lips  ceased  to  move,  and  life  was 
extinct ;  but  the  branches  retained  for  some  »ime  longer  the  vital

VENUS  AND  ADONIS.

FCeats,  in  "Endymion,"  alludes  to  Dryope  thusj— 

"  She  took  a  lute  from  which  there  pulsing  came 
A  Hvely  prelude,  fashioning  the  way 
In  which  her  voice  should  wander.     'Twas  a  lay 
More  subtle-cadenced,  more  forest-wild 
Than  Dryope' s  lone  lulling  cf  her  child,"  etc. 


Ve'nus  and  A-do'nis. 

Ve'nus,  playing  one  day  with  her  boy  Cupid,  wounded  hei 
bosom  with  one  of  his  arrows.  She  pushed  him  away  but 
the  wound  was  deeper  than  she 
thought.  Before  it  healed  she  be- 
held Adonis,  and  was  captivated 
with  him.  She  no  longer  took  any 
interest  in  her  favorite  resorts, — 
Paphos,  and  Cnidos,  and  Amathos, 
rich  in  metals.  She  absented  her- 
self even  from  heaven,  for  A-do'nis 
was  dearer  to  her  than  heaven. 
Him  she  followed,  and  bore  him 
company.  She  who  used  to  love  to 
recline  in  the  shade,  with  no  care 
but  to  cultivate  her  charms,  now 
rambles  through  the  woods  and  over 
the  hills,  dressed  like  the  huntress 
Diana;  and  calls  her  dogs, and  chases 
hares  and  stags,  or  other  game  that 
it  is  safe  to  hunt,  but  keeps  clear  of 
the  wolves  and  bears,  reeking  with 
the  slaughter  of  the  herd.  She 
charged  Adonis,  too,  to  beware  of 
such  dangerous  animals.  **  Be  brave 
toward  the  timid,"  said  she ;  '*  cour- 
age against  the  courageous  is  not 
safe.  Beware  how  you  expose  your- 
self to  danger,  and  put  my  happi- 
ness to  risk.  Attack  not  the  beasts  that  nature  has  armed  with 
weapons.     I  do  not  v?lue  your  glory  so  high  as  to  cotisen*  to

purchase  it  by  such  exposure.     Your  youth,  and  the  beauty  that 

charms  Venus,  will  not  touch 
the  hearts  of  lions  and  bristly 
boars.  Think  of  their  terrible 
claws  and  prodigious  strength  !  I 
hate  the  whole  race  of  them.  Do 
you  ask  me  why  ?' '  Then  she  told 
him  the  story  of  Atalanta  and 
Hippomenes,  who  were  changed 
into  lions  for  their  ingratitude  to 
her. 

Having  given  him  this  warn- 
ing, she  mounted  her  chariot, 
drawn  by  swans,  and  drove  away 
through  the  air.  But  Adonis  was 
too  noble  to  heed  such  counsels. 
The  dogs  had  roused  a  wild  boar 
from  his  lair,  and  the  youth  threw 
his  spear  and  wounded  the  ani- 
mal with  a  sidelong  stroke.  The 
beast  drew  out  the  weapon  with 
his  jaws  and  rushed  after  Adonis, 
who  turned  and  ran  ;  but  the  boar 
overtook  him  and  buried  his  tusks 
in  his  side,  and  stretched  him  dy-

•*  The  youth  lieth  dead  while  the  dogs  howl  around, 
And  the  nymphs  weep  aloud  from  the  mists  on  the  hill." 

— Mrs.  Browning. 

Venus,  in  her  swan-drawn  chariot,  had  not  yet  reached  Cy- 
prus when  she  heard  coming  up  through  mid-air  the  groans  of 
hei  beloved,  and  turned  her  white -winged  coursers  back  to  earth. 
As  she  drew  near  and  saw  from  on  high  his  lifeless  body  bathed 
in  blood,  she  alighted,  and,  bending  over  it,  beat  her  breast  and 
tore  her  hair.  Reproaching  the  Fates,  she  said,  *'Yet  theirs 
shall  be  but  a  partial  triumph  ;  memorials  of  my  grief  shall  en- 
dure, and  the  spectacle  of  your  death,  my  Adonis,  and  of  my 
lamentations,  shall  be  annually  renewed.     Your  blood  shall  be

changed  into  a  flower;  that  consolation  none  can  envy  me/' 
Thus  speaking,  she  sprinkled  nectar  on  the  blood  ;  and  as  they 
mingled,  bubbles  rose  as  in  a  pool  on  which  raindrops  fall,  and 
in  an  hour's  time  there  sprang  up  a  flower  of  bloody  hue  like 
that  of  the  pomegranate. 

*•  As  many  drops  as  from  Adonis  bled, 
So  many  tears  the  sorrowing  Venus  shed  : 
For  eveiy  drop  on  earth  a  flower  there  grows  : 
Anemones  for  tears;  for  blood  the  rose." — BiON  (Elton's  tr. ) 

But  it  is  short-lived.  It  is  said  the  wind  blows  the  blossoms 
open,  and  afterwards  blows  the  petals  away  ;  so  it  is  called  Ane- 
mone, or  Wind  Flower,  from  the  cause  which  assists  equally  in 
its  production  and  its  decay. 

Milton  alludes   to   the   story  of  Venus  and  Adonis   in   his 

Comus"  : — 

**  Beds  of  hyacinth  and  roses 
Where  young  Adonis  oft  reposes, 
Waxing  well  of  his  deep  wound 
In  slumber  soft,  and  on  the  ground 
Sadly  sits  th'  Assyrian  queen," 

A-pol'lo  and  Hy-a-cin'thus. 

A-pol'lo  was  passionately  fond  of  a  youth  named  Hy-a-cin'- 
thus. He  accompanied  him  in  his  sports,  carried  the  nets 
when  he  went  fishing,  led  the  dogs  when  he  went  to  hunt,  fol 
lowed  him  in  his  excursions  in  the  mountains,  and  neglected  for 
him  his  lyre  and  his  arrows.  One  day  they  played  a  game  of 
quoits  together,  and  Apollo,  heaving  aloft  the  discus,  with 
strength  mingled  with  skill,  sent  it  high  and  far.  Hyacinthup 
watched  it  as  it  flew,  and  excited  with  the  sport  ran  forward  tc 
seize  it,  eager  to  make  his  throw,  when  the  quoit  bounded  from 
the  earth  and  struck  him  in  the  forehead.  He  fainted  and  fell. 
The  god,  as  pale  as  himself,  raised  him  and  tried  all  his  art  to 
stanch  the  wound  and  retain  the  flitting  life,  but  all  in  vain  ;  the 
hurt  was  past  the  power  of  medicine.  As,  when  one  has  broken 
the  stem  of  a  lily  in  the  garden  it  hangs  its  head  and  turns  its 
flowers  to  the  earth,  so  the  head  of  the  dying  boy,  as  if  too 
heavy  for  his  neck,  fell  over  on  his  shoulder.     **Thou  diest,

Hyacinth/'  so  spoke  Phoebus,   '*  robbed  of  thy  you ih  by  me. 

Thine  is  the  suffering,  mine 
the  crime.  Would  tliat  I 
could  die  for  thee  1  But 
since  that  may  not  be,  thou 
shalt  live  with  me  in  mem- 
ory and  in  song.  My  lyre 
shall  celebrate  thee,  my  song 
shall  tell  thy  fate,  and  thou 
shalt  become  a  flower  in- 
scribed with  my  regrets.** 
While  Apollo  spoke,  be- 
hold, the  blood  which  had 
flowed  on  the  ground  and 
stained  the  herbage  ceased 
to  be  blood ;  but  a  flower 
of  hue  more  beautiful  than 
the  Tyrian  sprang  up,  resem- 
bling the  lily,  if  it  were  not 
that  this  is  puiple  and  that 
silvery  white.  And  this 
was  not  enough  for  Phoebus ; 
but  to  confer  still  greater 
honor,  he  marked  the  petals 
with  his  arrow,  and  in- 
scribed *'AhI  ah!"  upon 
them,  as  we  see  to  this  day. 
The  flower  bears  the  name 
of  Hyacinthus,  and  with 
every  returning  spring  re- 
vives the  memory  of  his  fate.* 
It  was  said  that  Zephyrus  (the  West -wind),  who  was  also 
fond  of  Hyacinthus  and  jealous  of  his  preference  of  Apollo,  blew 
the  quoit  out  of  its  course  to  make  it  strike  Hyacinthus.  Keats 
alludes  to  this  in  his  *'  Endymion,"  where  he  describes  the  look* 
ers-on  at  the  game  of  quoits : — 


Apollo  (Vatican,  Rome). 


*  It  is  evidently  not  our  modem  hyacinth  that  is  here  described.     It  is  per 
haps  some  species  of  iris,  or  perhaps  of  larkspur,  or  of  pansy.

CHAPTER  IX. 
Cc'yx  and  Hal-cy'o-ne;  or,  the  Harcy-on  Birds, 

Ce'yx  was  king  of  Thessaly,  where  he  reigned  in  peace. 
He  was  son  of  Hesperus,  tne  Day-btar,  and  tne  glow  of  hi* 
beauty  reminded  one  of  his  father.  Hal-cy'o-ne,  the  daughtei 
of  ^olus,  was  his  wife,  and  devotedly  attached  to  him.  Now 
Ceyx  was  in  deep  affliction  for  the  loss  of  his  brother,  and  dire- 
ful prodigies  following  his  brother's  death  made  him  feel  as  if 
the  gods  were  hostile  to  him.  He  thought  best,  therefore,  to 
make  a  voyage  to  Claros,  in  Ionia,  to  consult  the  oracle  of 
Apollo.  But  as  soon  as  he  disclosed  his  intention  to  his  wife 
Halcyone,  a  shudder  ran  through  her  frame,  and  her  face  grew 
deadly  pale.  **  What  fault  of  mine,  dearest  husband,  has  turned 
your  affection  from  me?  Where  is  that  love  of  me  that  used  to 
be  uppermost  in  your  thoughts  ?  Have  you  learned  to  feel  easy 
in  the  absence  of  Halcyone?  Would  you  rather  have  me 
away?"  She  also  endeavored  to  discourage  him,  by  describing 
the  violence  of  the  winds,  which  she  had  knoAvn  familiarly  when 
she  lived  at  home  in  her  father's  house,  -^olus  being  the  god  of 
the  winds,  and  having  as  much  as  he  could  do  to  restrain  them. 
"They  rush  together,**  said  she,  "with  such  fury  that  fire 
flashes  from  the  conflict.  But  if  you  must  go,**  she  added, 
"dear  husband,  let  me  go  with  you,  otherwise  I  shall  suffer,  not 
only  the  real  evils  which  you  must  encounter,  but  those  also 
which  my  fears  suggest.** 

These  words  weighed  heavily  on  the  mind  of  King  Ceyx,  and 
St  was  no  less  his  own  wish  than  hers  to  take  her  with  him,  but 
he  could  not  bear  to  expose  her  to  the  dangers  of  the  sea.  He 
answered,  therefore,  consoling  her  as  well  as  he  could,  and  fin- 
ished with  these  words  :  "I  promise,  by  the  rays  of  my  father, 
the  Day-star,  that  if  fate  permits  I  will  return  before  the  moon 
shall  have  twice  rounded  her  orb.'*  When  he  had  thus  spoken 
he  ordered  the  vessel  to  be  drawn  out  of  the  ship -house,  and  th«

oars  and  sails  to  be  put  aboard.  When  Halcyone  saw  these 
preparations  she  shuddered,  as  if  with  a  presentiment  of  evil. 
With  tears  and  sobs  she  said  farewell,  and  then  fell  senseless  to 
the  ground. 

Ceyx  would  still  have  lingered,  but  now  the  young  men 
grasped  their  oars  and  pulled  vigorously  through  the  waves  with 
\ong  and  measured  strokes.  Halcyone  raised  her  streaming 
»yes,  and  saw  her  husband  standing  on  the  deck,  waving  his 
aand  to  her.  She  answered  his  signal  till  the  vessel  had  receded 
so  far  that  she  could  no  longer  distinguish  his  form  from  the 
rest.  When  the  vessel  itself  could  no  more  be  seen,  she  strained 
her  eyes  to  catch  the  last  glimmer  of  the  sail,  till  that,  too,  disap- 
peared. Then,  retiring  to  her  chamber,  she  threw  herself  on 
her  solitary  couch. 

Meanwhile  they  glide  out  of  the  harbor,  and  the  breeze  plays 
among  the  ropes.  The  seamen  draw  in  their  oars  and  hoist 
their  sails.  When  half  or  less  of  their  course  was  passed,  as 
night  drew  on  the  sea  began  to  whiten  with  swelling  waves,  and 
the  east  wind  to  blow  a  gale.  The  master  gave  the  word  to  take 
in  sail,  but  the  storm  forbade  obedience,  for  such  is  the  roar  of 
the  wind  and  waves  his  orders  are  unheard.  The  men,  of  their 
own  accord,  busy  themselves  to  secure  the  oars,  to  strengthen 
the  ship,  to  reef  the  sail.  While  they  thus  do  what  to  each  one 
seems  best,  the  storm  increases.  The  shouting  of  the  men,  the 
rattling  of  the  shrouds  and  the  dashing  of  the  waves  mingle 
with  the  roar  of  the  thunder.  The  swelling  sea  seems  lifted  up 
to  the  heavens,  to  scatter  its  foam  among  the  clouds ;  then,  sink- 
ing away  to  the  bottom,  assumes  the  color  of  the  shoal, — a  Styg- 
ian blackness. 

The  vessel  shares  all  these  changes.  It  seems  like  a  wild 
"^ast  that  rushes  on  the  spears  of  the  hunters.  Rain  falls  in  tor- 
ments, as  if  the  skies  were  coming  down  to  unite  with  the  sea. 
When  the  lightning  ceases  for  a  moment,  the  night  seems  to  add 
its  own  darkness  to  that  of  the  storm  ;  then  comes  the  flash,  rend- 
ing the  darkness  asunder,  and  lighting  up  all  with  a  glare.  Skill 
fails,  courage  sinks,  and  death  seems  to  come  on  every  wave. 
The  men  are  stupefied  with  terror.  The  thought  of  parents  and 
kindred,  and  pledges  left  at  home,  comes  over  their  minds.

while  he  yearns  for  her,  he  yet  rejoices  in  her  absence.  Pres- 
ently the  mast  is  shattered  by  a  stroke  of  lightning,  the  ruddei 
broken,  and  the  triumphant  surge,  curling  over,  looks  down  upon 
the  wreck,  then  falls  and  crushes  it  to  fragments.  Some  of  the 
seamen,  stunned  by  the  stroke,  sink,  and  rise  no  more ;  others 
cling  to  fragments  of  the  wreck.  Ceyx,  with  the  hand  that  used 
to  grasp  the  sceptre,  holds  fast  to  a  plank,  calling  for  help, — ^alas, 
in  vain, — upon  his  father  and  his  father-in-law.  But  oftenest 
on  his  lips  was  the  name  of  Halcyone.  To  her  his  thoughts 
cling.  He  prays  that  the  waves  may  bear  his  body  to  her  sight, 
and  that  it  may  receive  burial  at  her  hands.  At  length  the 
waters  overwhelm  him,  and  he  sinks.  The  Day -star  looked  dim 
that  night.  Since  it  could  not  leave  the  heavens,  it  shrouded 
its  face  with  clouds. 

In  the  meanwhile  Halcyone,  ignorant  of  all  these  horrors, 
counted  the  days  till  her  husband's  promised  return.  Now  she 
gets  ready  the  garments  which  he  shall  put  on,  and  now  what 
she  shall  wear  when  he  arrives.  To  all  the  gods  she  offers  fre- 
quent incense,  but  more  than  all  to  Juno.  For  her  husband, 
who  was  no  more,  she  prayed  incessantly ;  that  he  might  be  safe  ; 
that  he  might  come  home ;  that  he  might  not,  in  his  absence, 
see  any  one  that  he  would  love  better  than  her.  But  of  all  these 
prayers,  the  last  was  the  only  one  destined  to  be  granted.  The 
goddess,  at  length,  could  not  bear  any  longer  to  be  pleaded  with 
for  one  already  dead,  and  to  have  hands  raised  to  her  altars  that 
ought  rather  to  be  offering  funeral  rites.  So,  calling  Iris,  she 
said,  "Iris,  my  faithful  messenger,  go  to  the  drowsy  dwelling  of 
Somnus,  and  tell  him  to  send  a  vision  to  Halcyone,  in  the  form 
of  Ceyx,  to  make  known  to  her  the  event." 

Iris  puts  on  her  robe  of  many  colors,  and  tinging  the  sky  with 
her  bow,  seeks  the  palace  of  the  King  of  Sleep.  Near  the  Cim- 
merian country  a  mountain  cave  is  the  abode  of  the  dull  god, 
Somnus.  Here  Phoebus  dares  not  come,  either  rising,  at  mid- 
day, or  setting.  Clouds  and  shadows  are  exhaled  from  the 
ground,  and  the  light  glimmers  faintly.  The  bird  of  dawning, 
with  crested  head,  never  there  calls  aloud  to  Aurora,  nor  watch- 
ful dog  nor  more  sagacious  goose  disturbs  the  silence.  No  wild 
beast,  nor  cattle,  nor  branch  moved  with  the  wind,  nor  sound 
Df  human   conversation,   breaks   the  stillness.      Silence   reigns

there  ;  but  from  the  bottom  of  the  rock  the  river  Lethe  flows, 
and  by  its  murmur  invites  to  sleep.  Poppies  grow  abundantly 
before  the  door  of  the  cave,  and  other  herbs,  from  whose  juices 
Night  collects  slumbers,  which  she  scatters  over  the  darkened 
earth.  There  is  no  gate  to  the  mansion,  to  creak  on  its  hinges, 
nor  any  watchman ;  but  in  the  midst  a  couch  of  black  ebony, 
adorned  with  black  plumes  and  curtains.  There  the  god  re 
ciines,  his  limbs  relaxed  with 
sleep.  Around  him  lie  dreams, 
resembling  all  various  forms,  as 
many  as  the  harvest  bears  stalks, 
or  the  forest  leaves,  or  the  sea- 
shore sand-grains. 

As  soon  as  the  goddess  en- 
tered and  brushed  away  the 
dreams  that  hovered  around 
her,  her  brightness  lit  up  all  the 
cave.  The  god,  scarce  open- 
ing his  eyes,  and  ever  and  anon 
dropping  his  beard  upon  his 
breast,  at  last  shook  himself 
free,  and  leaning  on  his  arm. 
Inquired  her  errand — for  he 
knew  who  she  was.  She  an- 
swered, **Somnus,  gentlest  of 
the  gods,  tranquillizer  of  minds 
and  soother  of  careworn  hearts, 

Juno  sends  you  her  commands  that  you  despatch  a  dream  to 
Halcyone,  in  the  city  of  Trachine,  representing  her  lost  husband 
and  all  the  events  of  the  wreck. '  * 

Having  delivered  her  message.  Iris  hastened  away,  for  she 
could  not  longer  endure  the  stagnant  air,  and  as  she  felt  drowsi- 
ness creeping  over  her  she  made  her  escape,  and  returned  by 
her  bow  the  way  she  came.  Then  Somnus  called  one  of  his 
numerous  sons — Morpheus — the  most  expert  in  counterfeiting 
forms,  and  in  imitating  the  walk,  the  countenance  and  mode  of 
speaking,  even  the  clothes  and  attitudes  most  characteristic  of 
each.  But  he  only  imitates  men,  leaving  it  to  another  to  per- 
sonate birds,  beasts  and  serpents.     Him  they  call  Icelos ;  and

Phantasos  is  a  third,  who  turns  himself  into  rocks,  waters,  wood*^ 
and  other  things  without  life.  These  wait  upon  kings  and  great 
personages  in  their  sleeping  hours,  while  others  move  among  the 
common  people.  Somnus  chose,  from  all  her  brothers,  Mor- 
pheus, to  perform  the  command  of  Iris  j  then  laid  his  head  on 
his  pillow  and  yielded  himself  to  grateful  repose. 

Morpheus  flew,  making  no  noise  with  his  wings,  and  soon 
came  to  the  Haemonian  city,  where,  laying  aside  his  wings,  he  as- 
sumed the  form  of  Ceyx.  Under  that  form,  but  pale  like  a  dead 
man,  naked,  he  stood  before  the  couch  of  the  wretched  wife. 
His  beard  seemed  soaked  with  water,  and  water  trickled  from 
his  drowned  locks.  Leaning  over  the  bed,  tears  streaming  from 
his  eyes,  he  said,  **  Do  you  recognize  your  Ceyx,  unhappy  wife, 
or  has  death  too  much  changed  my  visage  ?  Behold  me,  know 
me,  your  husband's  shade,  instead  of  himself.  Your  prayers, 
Halcyone,  availed  me  nothing.  I  am  dead.  No  more  deceive 
yourself  with  vain  hopes  of  my  return.  The  stormy  winds  sunk 
my  ship  in  the  -^gean  Sea,  waves  filled  my  mouth  while  it  called 
aloud  on  you.  No  uncertain  messenger  tells  you  this,  no  vague 
rumor  brings  it  to  your  ears.  I  come  in  person,  a  shipwrecked 
man,  to  tell  you  my  fate.  Arise  !  give  me  tears,  give  me  lamen- 
tations, let  me  not  go  down  to  Tartarus  unwept."  To  these 
words  Morpheus  added  the  voice  which  seemed  to  be  that  of  her 
husband  ;  he  seemed  to  pour  forth  genuine  tears ;  his  hands  had 
the  gestures  of  Ceyx. 

Halcyone,  weeping,  groaned,  and  stretched  out  her  arms,  in 
her  sleep,  striving  to  embrace  his  body,  but  grasping  only  the  air. 
**  Stay  !"  she  cried  ;  **  whither  do  you  fly?  let  us  go  together." 
Her  own  voice  awakened  her.  Starting  up,  she  gazed  eagerly 
around,  to  see  if  he  was  still  present,  for  the  servants,  alarmed 
by  her  cries,  had  brought  a  light.  When  she  found  him  not, 
she  smote  her  breast  and  rent  her  garments.  She  cares  not  to 
unbind  her  hair,  but  tears  it  wildly.  Her  nurse  asks  what  is  the 
cause  of  her  grief.  *'  Halcyone  is  no  more,"  she  answers,  **  she 
perished  with  her  Ceyx.  Utter  not  words  of  comfort,  he  is  ship- 
wrecked and  dead.  I  have  seen  him,  I  have  recognized  him.  I 
stretched  out  my  hands  to  seize  him  and  detain  him.  His  shade 
vanished,  but  it  was  the  true  shade  of  my  husband  Not  with 
Ihe  accustomed  features,  not  with  the  beauty  that  was  his,  but

pale,  naked,  and  with  his  hair  wet  with  sea-water,  he  appeared 
to  me.  Here,  in  this  very  spot,  the  sad  vision  stood,'* — and 
she  looked  to  find  the  mark  of  his  footsteps.  **  This  it  was,  this 
that  my  presaging  mind  foreboded,  when  I  implored  him  not  to 
leave  me  to  trust  himself  to  the  waves.  O,  how  I  wish,  since 
thou  wouldst  go,  thou  hadst  taken  me  with  thee  !  It  would  have 
been  far  better.  Then  I  should  have  had  no  remnant  of  life  to 
:pend  without  thee,  nor  a  separate  death  to  die.  If  I  could  bcal 
CO  live  and  struggle  to  endure,  I  should  be  more  cruel  to  myself 
than  the  sea  has  been  to  me.  But  I  will  not  struggle,  I  will  not 
be  separated  from  thee,  unhappy  husband.  This  time,  at  least, 
I  will  keep  thee  company.  In  death,  if  one  tomb  may  not  in- 
clude us,  one  epitaph  shall ;  if  I  may  not  lay  my  ashes  with  thine, 
my  name,  at  least,  shall  not  be  separated."  Her  grief  forbade 
more  words,  and  these  were  broken  with  tears  and  sobs. 

It  was  now  morning.  She  went  to  the  sea-shore,  and  sought 
the  spot  where  she  last  saw  him,  on  his  departure.  '*  While  he 
lingered  here,  and  cast  off  his  tacklings,  he  gave  me  his  last  kiss." 
While  she  reviews  every  object,  and  strives  to  recall  every  inci- 
dent, looking  out  over  the  sea,  she  descries  an  indistinct  object 
floating  in  the  water.  At  first  she  was  in  doubt  what  it  was, 
but  by  degrees  the  waves  bore  it  nearer,  and  it  was  plainly  the 
body  of  a  man.  Though  unknowing  of  whom,  yet,  as  it  was  of 
some  shipwrecked  one,  she  was  deeply  moved,  and  gave  it  her 
tears,  saying,  *  'Alas  !  unhappy  one,  and  unhappy,  if  such  there 
be,  thy  wife  !"  Borne  by  the  waves,  it  came  nearer.  As  she 
more  and  more  nearly  views  it,  she  trembles  more  and  more. 
Now,  now  it  approaches  the  shore.  Marks  that  she  recognizes 
now  appear.  It  is  her  husband  !  Stretching  out  her  trembling 
hands  towards  it,  she  exclaims,  **0,  dearest  husband,  is  it  thus 
/ou  return  to  me?" 

There  was  built  out  from  the  shore  a  mole,  constructed  to 
break  the  assaults  of  the  sea  and  stem  its  violent  ingress.  She 
leaped  upon  this  barrier  and  (it  was  wonderful  she  could  do  so) 
she  flew,  and  striking  the  air  with  wings  produced  on  the  instant, 
skimuied  along  the  surface  of  the  water.  As  she  flew,  her  throat 
poured  forth  sounds  full  of  grief,  and  like  the  voice  of  one  la- 
menting. When  she  touched  the  mute  an<l  bloodless  body,  she 
enfolded  its  beloved  limbs  with  her  new -formed  wings,  and  tried

to  give  kisses  with  her  horny  beak.  Whether  Ceyx  felt  it,  or 
whether  it  was  only  the  action  of  the  waves,  those  who  looked 
on  doubted,  but  the  body  seemed  to  raise  its  head.  But  indeed 
he  did  feel  it,  and  by  the  pitying  gods  both  of  them  were  changed 
into  birds.  They  mate  and  have  their  young  ones.  For  seven 
placid  days,  in  winter  time,  Halcyone  broods  over  her  n©*t, 
which  floats  upon  the  sea.

CHAPTER  X. 


Ver-tum'nus  and  Po-mo'na. 

The  Ham-a-dry'a-des  were  Wood-nymphs.  Po-mo'na 
Was  of  this  class,  and  no  one  excelled  her  in  love  of  the  garden 
and  the  culture  of  fruit.  She  cared  not  for  forests  and  rivers, 
but  loved  the  cultivated  country  and  trees  that  bear  delicious 
apples.  Her  right  hand  bore  for  its  weapon  not  a  javelin,  but  a 
pruning-knife.  Armed  with  this,  she  busied  herself  at  one  time 
to  repress  the  too  luxuriant  growths,  and  curtail  the  branches 
that  straggled  out  of  place ;  at  another,  to  split  the  twig  and  in- 
sert therein  a  graft,  making  the  branch  adopt  a  nursling  not  its 
own.  She  took  care,  too,  that  her  favorite  should  not  suffer 
from  drought,  and  led  streams  of  water  by  them  that  the  thirsty 
roots  might  drink.  This  occupation  was  her  pursuit,  her  pas- 
sion ;  and  she  was  free  from  that  which  Venus  inspires.  She 
was  not  without  fear  of  the  country  people,  and  kept  her  orchard 
locked,  and  allowed  not  men  to  enter. 

**  Bear  me,  Pomona,  to  thy  citron  groves, 
To  where  the  lemon  and  the  piercing  lime, 
With  the  deep  orange,  glowing  through  the  green. 
Their  lighter  glories  blend.     Lay  me  reclined 
Beneath  the  spreading  tamarind,  that  shakes. 
Fanned  by  the  breeze,  its  fever-cooling  fruit." — Thomson.

STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 


The  Fauns  and  Satyrs  would  have  given  all  they  possessed  to 
win  her,  and  so  would  old  Sylvanus,  who  looks  young  for  his 
years,  and  Pan,  who  wears  a  garland  of  pine  leaves  around  his 
head.  But  Ver-tum'nus  loved  her  best  of  all ;  yet  he  sped  no 
better  than  the  rest.     O,  how  often,  in  the  disguise  of  a  reaper, 

did  he  bring  her  corn  in  a  basket,  and 
looked  the  very  image  of  a  reaper  ! 
With  a  hay-band  tied  around  him,  one 
would  think  he  had  just  come  from 
turning  over  the  grass.  Sometimes  he 
would  have  an  ox -goad  in  his  hand, 
and  you  would  have  said  he  had  just 
unyoked  his  weary  oxen.  Now  he 
bore  a  pruning-hook,  and  personated 
a  vine-dresser ;  and  again,  with  a  lad- 
der on  his  shoulder,  he  seemed  as  if 
he  was  going  to  gather  apples.  Some- 
times he  trudged  along  as  a  discharged 
soldier,  and  again  he  bore  a  fishing- 
rod,  as  if  going  to  fish.  In  this  way 
he  gained  admission  to  her,  again  and 
again,  and  fed  his  passion  with  the 
sight  of  her. 

One  day  he  came  in  the  guise  of 
an  old  woman,  her  gray  hair  sur- 
mounted with  a  cap,  and  a  staff  in  his 
hand.  She  entered  the  garden  and 
admired  the  fruit.  ''It  does  you 
credit,  my  dear,"  she  said,  and  kissed 
her,  not  exactly  with  an  old  woman's 
kiss.  She  sat  down  on  a  bank,  and 
looked  up  at  the  branches  laden  with 
fruit  which  hung  over  her.  Opposite  was  an  elm  entwined 
with  a  vine  loaded  with  swelling  grapes.  She  praised  the  tree 
and  its  associated  vine,  equally.  *'  But,"  said  she,  "  if  the  tree 
stood  alone,  and  had  no  vine  clinging  to  it,  it  would  have  noth- 
ing to  attract  or  offer  us  but  its  useless  leaves.  And  equally  the 
vine,  if  it  were  not  twined  round  the  elm,  would  lie  prostrate  on 
the  ground.     Why  will  you  not  take  a  lesson  from  the  tree  and

you  would.  Helen  herself  had  not  more  numerous  suitors,  nor 
Penelope,  the  wife  of  shrewd  Ulysses.  Even  while  you  spurn 
them,  they  court  you, — rural  deities  and  others  of  every  kind 
that  frequent  these  mountains.  But  if  you  are  prudent  and  want 
to  make  a  good  alliance,  and  will  let  an  old  woman  advise  you, 
■ — who  loves  you  better  than  you  have  any  idea  of, — dismiss  aU 
the  rest  and  accept  Vertumnus,  on  my  recommendation.  I 
know  him  as  well  as  he  knows  himself.  He  is  not  a  wandering 
deity,  but  belongs  to  these  mountains.  Nor  is  he  like  too  many 
of  the  lovers  nowadays,  who  love  any  one  they  happen  to  see ; 
he  loves  you,  and  you  only.  Add  to  this,  he  is  young  and  hand* 
some,  and  has  the  art  of  assuming  any  shape  he  pleases,  and  can 
make  himself  just  what  you  command  him.  Moreover  he  loves 
the  same  things  that  you  do,  delights  in  gardening,  and  handles 
your  apples  with  admiration.  But  now  he  cares  nothing  for 
fruits,  nor  flowers,  nor  anything  else,  but  only  yourself.  Take 
pity  on  him,  and  fancy  him  speaking  now  with  my  mouth.  Re- 
member that  the  gods  punish  cruelty,  and  that  Venus  hates  a 
hard  heart,  and  will  visit  such  offences  sooner  or  later.  To 
prove  this,  let  me  tell  you  a  story,  which  is  well  known  in  Cy- 
prus to  be  a  fact,  and  I  hope  it  will  have  the  effect  to  make  you 
more  merciful. 

**Iphis  was  a  young  man  of  humble  parentage,  who  saw  and 
loved  Anaxarete,  a  noble  lady  of  the  ancient  family  of  Teucer.  He 
struggled  long  with  his  passion,  but  when  he  found  he  could  not 
subdue  it,  he  came  a  suppliant  to  her  mansion.  First  he  told 
his  passion  to  her  nurse,  and  begged  her  as  she  loved  her  foster- 
child  to  favor  his  suit.  And  then  he  tried  to  win  her  domestics 
to  his  side.  Sometimes  he  committed  his  vows  to  written  tab- 
lets, and  often  hung  at  her  door  garlands  which  he  had  moistened 
with  his  tears.  He  stretched  himself  on  her  threshold,  and  ut- 
tered  his  complaints  to  the  cruel  bolts  and  bars.  She  was  deafer 
than  the  surges  which  rise  in  the  November  gale ;  harder  than 
steel  from  the  German  forges,  or  a  rock  that  still  clings  to  its 
native  cliff.  She  mocked  and  laughed  at  him,  adding  cruel 
words  to  her  ungentle  treatment,  and  gave  not  the  slightest 
gleam  of  hope. 

Iphis  could  not  any  lone^er  endure  the  torments  of  hopelaii

love,  and,  standing  beto^e  her  doors,  he  spake  these  last  words  i 
*  Anaxarete,  you  have  conquered,  and  shall  no  longer  have  to 
bear  my  importunities.  Enjoy  your  triumph  !  Sing  songs  oi 
joy,  and  bind  your  forehead  with  laurel — you  have  conquered  \ 
I  die ;  stony  heart,  rejoice  I  This  at  least  I  can  do  to  gratify 
you,  and  force  you  to  praise  me ;  and  thus  shall  I  prove  that  the 
love  of  you  left  me  but  with  life.  Nor  will  I  leave  it  to  rumor 
to  tell  you  of  my  death.  I  will  come  myself,  and  you  shall  see 
me  die,  and  feast  your  eyes  on  the  spectacle.  Yet,  O,  ye  gods, 
who  look  down  on  mortal  woes,  oDserve  my  fate  I  I  ask  but 
this ;  let  me  be  remembered  in  coming  ages,  and  add  those  years 
to  my  fame  which  you  have  reft  from  my  life.*  Thus  he  said, 
and,  turning  his  pale  face  and  weeping  eyes  towards  her  mansion, 
he  fastened  a  rope  to  the  gate-post,  on  which  he  had  often  hung 
garlands,  and  putting  his  head  into  the  noose,  he  murmured, 
'This  garland  at  least  will  please  you,  cruel  girl  I'  and  falling, 
hung  suspended  with  his  neck  broken.  As  he  fell  he  struck 
against  the  gate,  and  the  sound  was  as  the  sound  of  a  groan. 
The  servants  opened  the  door  and  found  him  dead,  and  with  ex- 
clamations of  pity  raised  him  and  carried  him  home  to  his 
mother,  for  his  father  was  not  living.  She  received  the  dead 
body  of  her  son  and  folded  the  cold  form  to  her  bosom,  while 
she  poured  forth  the  sad  words  which  bereaved  mothers  utter. 
The  mournful  funeral  passed  through  the  town,  and  the  pale 
corpse  was  borne  on  a  bier  to  the  place  of  the  funeral  pile.  By 
chance  the  home  of  Anaxarete  was  on  the  street  where  the  pro- 
cession passed,  and  the  lamentations  of  the  mourners  met  the 
ears  of  her  whom  the  avenging  deity  had  already  marked  for 
punishment. 

**  *  Let  us  see  this  sad  procession,*  said  she,  and  mounted  to  a 
turret,  whence  through  an  open  window  she  looked  upon  the 
funeral.  Scarce  had  her  eyes  rested  upon  the  form  of  I  phis 
Btretched  on  the  bier  when  they  began  to  stiffen,  and  the  warm 
blood  in  her  body  to  become  cold.  Endeavoring  to  step  back, 
she  found  she  could  not  move  her  feet ;  trying  to  turn  away  her 
face,  she  tried  in  vain  ;  and  by  degrees  all  her  limbs  became 
stony,  like  her  heart.  That  you  may  not  doubt  the  fact,  the 
statue  still  remains,  and  stands  in  the  temple  of  Venus  at  Salamis,

dear,  and  lay  aside  your  scorn  and  your  delays,  and  accept  a 
lover.  So  may  neither  the  vernal  frosts  blight  your  young  fruits, 
nor  furious  winds  scatter  your  blossoms  !'* 

When  Vertumnus  had  spoken  thus  he  dropped  the  disguise  of 
an  old  woman  and  stood  before  her  in  his  proper  person,  as  a 
comely  youth.  It  appeared  to  her  like  the  sun  bursting  through 
a  cloud.  He  would  have  renewed  his  entreaties,  but  there  was 
no  need  ;  his  arguments  and  the  sight  of  his  true  form  prevailed 
and  the  Nymph  no  longer  resisted,  but  owned  a  mutual  flame.

CHAPTER  XI. 
Cu'pid  and  Psy'che. 

A  CERTAIN  king  and  queen  had  three  daughters.  The  chanos' 
of  the  two  elder  were  more  than  common,  but  the  beauty  oi"  the 
youngest  was  so  wonderful  that  the  poverty  of  language  is  un- 
able to  express  its  due  praise.  The  fanie  of  her  beauty  was  so 
great  that  strangers  from  neighboring  countries  came  in  crowds 
to  enjoy  the  sight,  and  looked  on  her  with  amazement,  paying  her 
that  homage  which  is  due  only  to  Venus  herself.  In  fact  Venus 
found  her  altars  deserted,  while  men  turned  their  devotion  to 
this  young  virgin.  As  she  passed  along  the  people  sang  her 
praises,  and  strewed  her  way  with  chaplets  and  flowers. 

This  perversion  of  homage,  due  only  to  the  immortal  powers, 
to  the  exaltation  of  a  mortal,  gave  great  offence  to  the  real 
Venus.  Shaking  her  ambrosial  locks  with  indignation,  she  ex- 
claimed, "  Am  I,  then,  to  be  eclipsed  in  my  honors  by  a  mortal 
girl  ?  In  vain,  then,  did  that  royal  shepherd,  whose  judgment 
was  approved  by  Jove  himself,  give  me  the  palm  of  beauty  over 
my  illustrious  rivals,  Pallas  and  Juno.  But  she  shall  not  so 
quietly  usurp  my  honors.  I  will  give  her  cause  to  repent  of  so 
unlawful  a  beauty. '  * 

Thereupon  she  calls  her  winged  son  Cu'pid,  mischievous  enough 
in  his  own  nature,  and  rouses  and  provokes  him  yet  more  by  her 
complaints.  She  points  out  Psy'che  to  him  and  says,  **  My 
dear  son,  punish  that  contumacious  beauty ;  give  thy  mother  a 
revenge  as  sweet  as  her  injuries  are  great ;  infuse  into  the  bosom 
of  that  haughty  girl  a  passion  for  some  low,  mean,  unworthy 
being,  so  that  she  may  reap  a  mortification  as  great  as  her  pres- 
ent exultation  and  triumph." 

Cupid  prepared  to  obey  the  commands  of  his  mother.  There 
are  two  fountains  in  Venus's  garden,  one  of  sweet  waters,  the 
other  of  bitter.  Cupid  filled  two  amber  vases,  one  from  each 
fountain,  and,  suspending  them  from  the  top  of  his  quiver,  has*

tened  to  the  chamber  of  Psyche,  whom  he  found  asleep.  He 
shed  a  few  drops  from  the  bitter  fountain  over  her  lips,  though 
the  sight  of  her  almost  moved  him  to  pity,  then  touched  hei 
side  with  the  point  of  his  arrow.  At  the  touch  she  awoke  and 
opened  eyes  upon  Cupid  (himself  invisible),  which  so  startled 
him  that  in  his 
confusion  he 
wounded  him- 
self with  his  own 
arrow.  Heedless 
of  his  wound,  his 
whole  thought 
now  was  to  re- 
pair the  mischief 
he  had  done,  and 
he  poured  the 
balmy  drops  of 
joy  over  all  her 
silken  ringlets. 

Psyche,  hence- 
forth frowned 
upon  by  Venus, 
derived  no  bene- 
fit from  all  her 
charms.  True, 
all  eyes  were  cast 
eagerly  upon 
her,  and  every 
mouth  spoke  her 
praises ;  but  nei- 
ther king,  royal 
youth  nor  ple- 
beian presented  himself  to  demand  her  in  marriage.  Her  two 
elder  sisters  of  moderate  charms  had  now  long  been  married  to 
two  royal  princes;  but  Psyche,  in'^her  lonely  apartment,  de- 
plored her  solitude,  sick  of  that  beauty  which,  while  it  procured 
abundance  of  flattery,  had  failed  to  awaken  love. 

Her  parents,  afraid  that  they  had  unwittingly  incurred  the 
anger  of  the  gods,  consulted  the  oracle  of  Apoxlo,  and  received 


Cupid,  or  Eros  (Capitol,  Rome  J.

this  ansNver :  '*  The  virgin  is  destined  for  the  bride  of  no  mortai 
lover.  Her  future  husband  awaits  her  on  the  top  of  the  rnoun* 
tain.     He  is  a  monster  whom  neither  gods  nor  men  can  resist. ' ' 

This  dreadful  decree  of  the  oracle  filled  all  the  people  with 
dismay,  and  her  parents  abandoned  themselves  to  grief.  But 
Psyche  said,  **  Why,  my  dear  parents,  do  you  now  lament  me? 
Vou  should  rather  have  grieved  when  the  people  showered  upon 
ne  undeserved  honors,  and  with  one  voice  called  me  a  VenuSo 
.1  now  perceive  that  I  am  a  victim  to  that  name.  I  submit. 
Lead  me  to  that  rock  to  which  my  unhappy  fate  has  destined 
me.''  Accordingly,  all  things  being  prepared,  the  royal  maid 
took  her  place  in  the  procession,  which  more  resembled  a  fu- 
neral than  a  nuptial  pomp,  and  with  her  parents,  amid  the  lamen* 
tations  of  the  people,  ascended  the  mountain,  on  the  summit  of 
which  they  left  her  alone,  and  with  sorrowful  hearts  returned 
home. 

While  Psyche  stood  on  the  ridge  of  the  mountain,  panting 
with  fear  and  with  eyes  full  of  tears,  the  gentle  Zephyr  raised 
her  from  the  earth  and  bore  her  with  an  easy  motion  into  a 
flowery  dale.  By  degrees  her  mind  became  composed,  and  she 
laid  herself  down  on  the  grassy  bank  to  sleep.  When  she  awoke, 
refreshed  with  sleep,  she  looked  round  and  beheld  near  by  a 
pleasant  grove  of  tall  and  stately  trees.  She  entered  it,  and  in 
the  midst  discovered  a  fountain,  sending  forth  clear  and  crystal 
waters,  and,  fast  by,  a  magnificent  palace  whose  august  front  im- 
pressed the  spectator  that  it  was  not  the  work  of  mortal  hands, 
but  the  happy  retreat  of  some  god.  Drawn  by  admiration  and 
wonder,  she  approached  the  building  and  ventured  to  enter. 
Every  object  she  met  filled  her  with  pleasure  and  amazement. 
Golden  pillars  supported  the  vaulted  roof,  and  the  walls  were 
enriched  with  carvings  and  paintings  representing  beasts  of  the 
chase  and  rural  scenes,  adapted  to  delight  the  eye  of  the  be- 
holder. Proceeding  onward,  she  perceived  that  besides  the 
apartments  of  state  there  were  others  filled  with  all  manner  of 
treasures,  and  beautiful  and  precious  productions  of  nature  and 
art. 

While  her  eyes  were  thus  occupied,  a  voice  addressed  her, 
though  she  saw  no  one,  uttering  these  words  :  **  Sovereign  lady, 
all  that  you  see  is  yours.     We  whose  voices  you  hear  are  youJ

servants,  and  shall  obey  all  your  commands  with  our  utmost 
care  and  diligence.  Retire,  therefore,  to  your  chamber  and  re- 
pose on  your  bed  of  down,  and,  when  you  see  fit,  repair  to  the 
bath.  Supper  awaits  you  in  the  adjoining  alcove  when  it  pleases 
you  to  take  your  seat  there.'* 

Psyche  gave  ear  to  the  admonitions  of  her  vocal  attendants 
tnd,  after  repose  and  the  refreshment 
of  the  bath,  seated  herself  in  the  al- 
cove, where  a  table  immediately  pre- 
sented itself,  without  any  visible  aid 
from  waiters  or  servants,  and  covered 
with  the  greatest  delicacies  of  food 
and  the  most  nectareous  wines.  Her 
ears,  too,  were  feasted  with  music  from 
invisible  performers,  of  whom  one 
sang,  another  played  on  the  lute,  and 
all  closed  in  the  wonderful  harmony 
of  a  full  chorus. 

She  had  not  yet  seen  her  destined 
husband.  He  came  only  in  the  hours 
of  darkness  and  fled  before  the  dawn 
of  morning,  but  his  accents  were  full 
of  love,  and  inspired  a  like  passion  in 
her.  She  often  begged  him  to  stay 
and  let  her  behold  him,  but  he  would 
not  consent.  On  the  contrary,  he 
charged  her  to  make  no  attempt  to 
see  him,  for  it  was  his  pleasure,  for 
the  best  of  reasons,  to  keep  concealed. 
**  Why  should  you  wish  to  behold 
Tie?'*  he  said  ;  **  have  you  any  doubt 
of  my  love?  have  you  any  wish  un- 
gratified  ?  If  you  saw  me,  perhaps  you  would  fear  me,  perhaps 
adore  me,  but  all  I  ask  of  you  is  to  love  me.  I  would  rathei 
you  would  love  me  as  an  equal  than  adore  me  as  a  god." 

** '  I  am  with  thee  only  while  I  keep 

My  visage  hidden  ;  and  if  thou  once  shouldst  see 
My  face,  I  must  forsake  thee :  the  high  gods 
Link  Love  with  Faith,  and  he  withdraws  himself 
From  the  full  gaze  of  Knowledge.'  " — Lewis  Morris.

Rome).

This  reasoning  somewhat  quieted  Psyche  for  a  time,  and  while 
the  novelty  lasted  she  felt  quite  happy.  But  at  length  the  thought 
of  her  parents,  left  in  ignorance  of  her  fate,  and  of  her  sisters, 
precluded  from  sharing  with  her  the  delights  of  her  situation, 
preyed  on  her  mind  and  made  her  begin  to  feel  her  palace  as 
but  a  splendid  prison.  When  her  husband  came  one  night,  she 
told  him  her  distress,  and  at  last  drew  from  him  an  unwilling 
consent  that  her  sisters  should  be  brought  to  see  her. 

So  calling  Zephyr,  she  acquainted  him  with  her  husband's 
commands,  and  he,  promptly  obedient,  soon  brought  them  across 
the  mountain  down  to  their  sister's  valley.  They  embraced  her 
and  she  returned  their  caresses.  **Come,"  said  Psyche,  *' enter 
with  me  my  house  and  refresh  yourselves  with  whatever  your  sister 
has  to  offer."  Then  taking  their  hands  she  led  them  into  her 
golden  palace,  and  committed  them  to  the  care  of  her  numerous 
train  of  attendant  voices,  to  refresh  them  in  her  baths  and  at  her 
table,  and  to  show  them  all  her  treasures.  The  view  of  these 
celestial  delights  caused  envy  to  enter  their  bosoms,  at  seeing 
their  young  sister  possessed  of  such  state  and  splendor,  so  much 
exceeding  their  own. 

They  asked  her  numberless  questions,  among  others  what  sort 
of  a  person  her  husband  was.  Psyche  replied  that  he  was  a 
beautiful  youth,  who  generally  spent  the  daytime  in  hunting 
upon  the  mountains.  The  sisters,  not  satisfied  with  this  reply, 
soon  made  her  confess  that  she  had  never  seen  him.  Then  they 
proceeded  to  fill  her  bosom  with  dark  suspicions. 

"They  told  her  that  he  to  whose  vows  she  had  hstened 
Through  night' s  fleeting  hours  was  a  spirit  unblest ; 
Unholy  the  eyes  that  beside  her  had  glistened, 
And  evil  the  lips  she  in  darkness  had  pressed. 

When  next  in  thy  chamber  the  bridegroom  reclineth, 
Bring  near  him  thy  lamp  when  in  slumber  he  lies, 

And  then  as  the  light  o'er  his  dark  features  shineth, 

Thou' 11  see  what  a  demon  has  won  all  thy  sighs." — MoORE. 

*'  Call  to  mind,"  they  said,  "  the  Pythian  oracle  that  declared 
you  destined  to  marry  a  direful  and  tremendous  monster.  The 
inhabitants  of  this  valley  say  that  your  husband  is  a  terrible  and 
monstrous  serpent,  who  nourishes  you  for  a  while  with  dainties

that  he  may  by  and  by  devour  you.  Take  our  advice.  Provide 
yourself  with  a  lamp  and  a  sharp  knife  ;  put  them  in  concealment 
that  your  husband  may  not  discover  them,  and  when  he  is  sound 
asleep,  slip  out  of  bed,  bring  forth  your  lamp,  and  see  for  your- 
self whether  what  they  say  is  true  or  not.  If  it  is,  hesitate  not 
to  cut  off  the  monster's  head,  and  thereby  recover  your  liberty." 
Psyche  resisted  these  persuasions  as  well  as  she  could,  but  they

did  not  fail  to  have  their  effect  on  her  mind,  and  when  her  sis- 
ters were  gone,  their  words  and  her  own  curiosity  were  too 
strong  for  her  to  resist.  So  she  prepared  her  lamp  and  a  sharp 
knife,  and  hid  them  out  of  sight  of  her  husband.     When  he  had

fallen  into  his  first  sleep  she  silently  rose,  and  uncovering  her 
lamp  beheld  not  a  hideous  monster,  but  the  most  beautiful  and 
charming  of  the  gods,  with  his  golden  ringlets  wandering  over 
his  snowy  neck  and  crimson  cheek,  with  two  dewy  wings  on  his 
shoulders,  whiter  than  snow,  and  with  shining  feathers  like  the 
tender  blossoms  of  spring.  As  she  leaned  the  lamp  over  to  have 
a  nearer  view  of  his  face  a  drop  of  burning  oil  fell  on  the  shoulder 
of  the  god,  startled  with  which  he  opened  his  eyes  and  fixed 
them  full  upon  her  ;  then,  without  saying  one  word,  he  spread  his 
white  wings  and  flew  out  of  the  window.  Psyche,  in  vain  en- 
deavoring to  follow  him,  fell  from  the  window  to  the  ground. 
Cupid,  beholding  her  as  she  lay  in  the  dust,  stopped  his  flight 
for  an  instant  and  said,  *'  O  foolish  Psyche,  is  it  thus  you  repay 
my  love?  After  having  disobeyed  my  mother's  commands  and 
made  you  my  wife,  v/ill  you  think  me  a  monster  and  cut  off  my 
head  ?  But  go  ;  return  to  your  sisters,  whose  advice  you  seem 
to  think  preferable  to  mine.  I  inflict  no  other  punishment  on 
you  than  to  leave  you  forever.  Love  cannot  dwell  with  suspi- 
cion. ' ' 

"  Farewell — what  a  dream  thy  suspicion  hath  broken. 

Thus  ever  Affection's  fond  vision  is  crost ; 
Dissolved  are  her  spells  when  a  doubt  is  but  spoken, 

And  love  once  disturbed  for  ever  is  lost." — MoORE. 

So  saying  he  fled  away,  leaving  poor  Psyche  prostrate  on  the 
ground,  filling  the  place  with  mournful  lamentations. 

When  she  had  recovered  some  degree  of  composure  she  looked 
around  her,  but  the  palace  and  gardens  had  vanished,  and  she 
found  herself  in  the  open  field  not  far  from  the  city  where  her 
sisters  dwelt.  She  repaired  thither  and  told  them  the  whole 
story  of  her  misfortunes,  at  which,  pretending  to  grieve,  those 
spiteful  creatures  inwardly  rejoiced;  "for  now,"  said  they,  "he 
will  perhaps  choose  one  of  us."  With  this  idea,  without  saying 
a  word  of  her  intentions,  each  of  them  rose  early  the  next  morn- 
ing and  ascended  the  mountain,  and  having  reached  the  top, 
called  upon  Zephyr  to  receive  her  and  bear  her  to  his  lord  ;  then 
leaping  up,  and  not  being  sustained  by  Zephyr,  fell  down  the 
precipice  and  was  dashed  to  pieces. 

Psyche  meanwhile  wandered  day  and  night,  without  food  or 
repose,  in  search  of  her  husband.     Casting  her  eyes  on  a  lofty 


CUPID  AND  PSYCHE.  lO/ 

mountain  having  on  its  brow  a  magnificent  temple,  she  sighed 
and  said  to  herself,  *'  Perhaps  my  love,  my  lord,  inhabits  there," 
and  directed  her  steps  thither. 

She  had  no  sooner  entered  than  she  saw  heaps  of  corn,  some 
in  loose  ears  and  some  in  sheaves,  with  mingled  ears  of  barley. 
Scattered  about  lay  sickles  and  rakes,  and  all  the  instruments  of 
harvest,  without  order,  as  if  thrown  carelessly  out  of  the  weary 
reapers'  hands  in  the  sultry  hours  of  the  day. 

This  unseemly  confusion  the  pious  Psyche  put  an  end  to  by 
separating  and  sorting  every  thing  to  its  proper  place  and  kind, 
believing  that  she  ought  to  neglect  none  of  the  gods,  but  en- 
deavor by  her  piety  to  engage  them  all  in  her  behalf.  The  holy 
Ceres,  whose  temple  it  was,  finding  her  so  religiously  employed, 
thus  spoke  to  her  :  *'  O  Psyche,  truly  worthy  of  our  pity,  though 
I  cannot  shield  you  from  the  frowns  of  Venus,  yet  I  can  teach 
you  how  best  to  allay  her  displeasure.  Go  then  and  voluntarily 
surrender  yourself  to  your  lady  and  sovereign,  and  try  by  modesty 
and  submission  to  win  her  forgiveness,  and  perhaps  her  favor 
will  restore  you  the  husband  you  have  lost." 

Psyche  obeyed  the  commands  of  Ceres  and  took  her  way  to 
the  temple  of  Venus,  endeavoring  to  fortify  her  mind  and  ru- 
minating on  what  she  should  say  and  how  best  propitiate  the 
angry  goddess,  feeling  that  the  issue  was  doubtful  and  perhaps 
fatal. 

Venus  received  her  with  angry  countenance.  *'  Most  undutiful 
and  faithless  of  servants,"  said  she,  "do  you  at  last  remember 
that  you  really  have  a  mistress  ?  Or  have  you  rather  come  to 
see  your  sick  husband,  yet  laid  up  of  the  wound  given  him  by 
his  loving  wife?  You  are  so  ill-favored  and  disagreeable  that 
the  only  way  you  can  merit  your  lover  must  be  by  dint  of  indus 
try  and  diligence.  I  will  make  trial  of  your  housewifery.*' 
Then  she  ordered  Psyche  to  be  led  to  the  storehouse  of  her  tem= 
pie,  where  was  laid  up  a  great  quantity  of  wheat,  barley,  millet, 
vetches,  beans  and  lentils  prepared  for  food  for  her  pigeons,  and 
said,  *'Take  and  separate  all  these  grains,  putting  all  of  the 
same  kind  in  a  parcel  by  themselves,  and  see  that  you  get  it 
done  before  evening. ' '  Then  Venus  departed  and  left  her  to 
lier  task. 

But  Psyche,  in  a  perfect  consternation  at  the  enormous  work.

sat  stupid  and  silent,  without  moving  a  finger  to  the  inextricable 
heap. 

While  she  sat  despairing  Cupid  stirred  up  the  little  ant,  a  na- 
tive of  the  fields,  to  take  compassion  on  her.  The  leader  of 
the  ant-hill,  followed  by  whole  hosts  of  h\s  six-legged  subjects, 
approached  the  heap,  and  with  the  utmost  diligence,  taking  grain 

by  grain,  they  separated 
the  pile,  sorting  each  kind 
to  its  parcel ;  and  when  it 
was  all  done  they  vanished 
out  of  sight  in  a  moment. 

Venus,  at  the  approach 
of  twilight,  returned  from 
the  banquet  of  the  gods, 
breathing  odors  and 
crowned  with  roses.  See- 
ing the  task  done  she  ex- 
claimed, *'  This  is  no  work 
of  yours,  wicked  one,  but 
his,  whom  to  your  own  and 
his  misfortune  you  have  en- 
ticed." So  saying,  she 
threw  her  a  piece  of  black 
bread  for  her  supper  and 
went  away. 

Next  morning  Venus  or- 
dered Psyche  to  be  called, 
and  said  to  her,  *' Behold 
yonder  grove  which  stretch  • 
es  along  the  margin  of  the 
water.    There  you  will  find 
sheep  feeding  without  a  shepherd,  with  golden-shining  fleeces 
on  their  backs.     Go,  fetch  me  a  sample  of  that  precious  wool 
gathered  from  every  one  of  their  fleeces." 

Psyche  obediently  went  to  the  river  side,  prepared  to  do  her 
best  to  execute  the  command.  But  the  river  god  inspired  the 
reeds  with  harmonious  murmurs,  which  seemed  to  say,  **0, 
maiden,  severely  tried,  tempt  not  the  dangerous  flood,  nor  ven- 
ture among  the  formidable  rams  on  the  other  side,  for  as  long  a?

they  are  under  the  influence  of  the  rising  sun  they  burn  with  a 
cruel  rage  to  destroy  mortals  with  their  sharp  horns  or  rude 
teeth.  But  when  the  noontide  sun  has  driven  the  cattle  to  the 
shade,  and  the  serene  spirit  of  the  flood  has  lulled  them  to  rest, 
you  may  then  cross  in  safety,  and  you  will  find  the  woolly  gold 
sticking  to  the  bushes  and  the  trunks  of  the  trees." 

Thus  the  compassionate  river  god  gave  Psyche  instructions 
how  to  accomplish  her  task,  and  by  observing  his  directions  she 
soon  returned  to  Venus  with  her  arms  full  of  the  golden  fleece ; 
but  she  received  not  the  approbation  of  her  implacable  mistress, 
who  said,  **  I  know  very  well  it  is  by  none  of  your  own  doings 
that  you  have  succeeded  in  this  task,  and  I  am  not  satisfied  yet 
that  you  have  any  capacity  to  make  yourself  useful.  But  I  have 
another  task  for  you.  Here,  take  this  box,  and  go  your  way  to 
the  infernal  shades,  and  give  this  box  to  Proserpine  and  say, 
*  My  mistress  Venus  desires  you  to  send  her  a  little  of  your 
beauty,  for  in  tending  her  sick  son  she  has  lost  some  of  her  own.* 
Be  not  too  long  on  your  errand,  for  I  must  paint  myself  with  it 
to  appear  at  the  circle  of  the  gods  and  goddesses  this  evening. ' ' 

Psyche  was  now  satisfied  that  her  destruction  was  at  hand,  be- 
ing obliged  to  go  with  her  own  feet  directly  down  to  Erebus. 
Wherefore,  to  make  no  delay  of  what  was  not  to  be  avoided,  she 
goes  to  the  top  of  a  high  tower  to  precipitate  herself  headlong, 
thus  to  descend  the  shortest  way  to  the  shades  below.  But  a 
voice  from  the  tower  said  to  her,  *'Why,  poor,  unlucky  girl,  dost 
thou  design  to  put  an  end  to  thy  days  in  so  dreadful  a  manner? 
A.nd  what  cowardice  makes  thee  sink  under  this  last  danger  who 
tiast  been  so  miraculously  supported  in  all  thy  former  ?'  *  Then 
the  voice  told  her  how  by  a  certain  cave  she  might  reach  the 
realms  of  Pluto,  and  how  to  avoid  all  the  dangers  of  the  road, 
to  pass  by  Cerberus,  the  three-headed  dog,  and  prevail  on 
Charon,  the  ferryman,  to  take  her  across  the  black  river  and 
bring  her  back  again.  But  the  voice  added,  "When  Proserpine 
has  given  you  the  box,  filled  with  her  beauty,  of  all  things  this 
is  chiefly  to  be  observed  by  you,  that  you  never  once  open  or 
look  into  the  box,  nor  allow  your  curiosity  to  pry  into  the  treas- 
ure of  the  beauty  of  the  goddesses.*' 

Psyche  encouraged  by  this  advice  obeyed  it  in  all  things,  and 
taking  heed  to  her  ways  travelled  safely  to  the  kingdom  of  Pluto.

She  was  admitted  to  the  palace  of  Proserpine,  and  without  ac 
cepting  the  delicate  seat  or  delicious  banquet  that  was  offered 
her,  but  contented  with  coarse  bread  for  her  food,  she  delivered 
her  message  from  Venus.  Presently  the  box  was  returned  to  her, 
'^hut  and  filled  with  the  precious  commodity.    Then  she  returned 


Cupid  and  Psyche  on  Mt.  Olympus  (Paul  Thumann). 

Lhe  way  she  came,  and  glad  was  she  to  come  out  once  more  into 
the  light  of  day. 

But  having  got  so  far  successfully  through  her  dangerous  task 
a  longing  desire  seized  her  to  examine  the  contents  of  the  box. 
**What,"  said  she,  **  shall  I,  the  carrier  of  this  divine  beauty, 
not  take  the  least  bit  to  put  on  my  cheeks  to  appear  to  more  ad*

vantage  in  the  eyes  of  my  beloved  husband  !"  So  she  caiefully 
opened  the  box  and  found  nothing  there  of  any  beauty  at  all, 
but  an  infernal  and  truly  Stygian  sleep,  which,  being  thus  set  free 
from  its  prison,  took  possession  of  her,  and  she  fell  down  in  the 
midst  of  the  road,  a  sleepy  corpse  without  sense  or  motion. 

**  But  what  was  there  she  saw  not,  for  her  head 
Fell  back,  and  nothing  she  remembered 
Of  all  her  Ufe." — William  Morris. 

But  Cupid,  being  now  recovered  from  his  wound,  and  not 
able  to  bear  longer  the  absence  of  his  beloved  Psyche,  slipping 
through  the  smallest  crack  of  the  window  of  his  chamber  which 
happened  to  be  left  opened,  fle>/  to  the  spot  where  Psyche  lay, 
and  gathering  up  the  sleep  from  her  body  closed  it  again  in  the 
box,  and  waked  Psyche  with  a  light  touch  of  one  of  his  arrows. 
**  Again,"  said  he,  '*  hast  thou  almost  perished  by  the  same  curi- 
osity. But  now  perform  exactly  the  task  imposed  on  you  by 
my  mother,  and  I  will  care  for  the  rest." 

Then  Cupid,  swift  as  lightning  penetrating  the  heights  of 
heaven,  presented  himself  before  Jupiter  with  his  supplication. 
Jupiter  lent  a  favoring  ear,  and  pleaded  the  cause  of  the  lovers 
so  earnestly  with  Venus  that  he  won  her  consent.  On  this  he 
sent  Mercury  to  bring  Psyche  up  to  the  heavenly  assembly,  and 
when  she  arrived,  handing  her  a  cup  of  ambrosia,  he  said, 
**  Drink  this.  Psyche,  and  be  immortal ;  nor  shall  Cupid  ever 
break  away  from  the  knot  in  which  he  is  tied,  but  these  nuptials 
shall  be  perpetual." 

Thus  Psyche  became  at  last  united  to  Cupid,  and  in  due  time 
they  had  a  daughter  born  to  them  whose  name  was  Pleasure. 

In  works  of  art  Psyche  is  represented  as  a  maiden  with  the 
wings  of  a  butterfly,  along  with  Cupid,  in  the  different  situa 
tions  described  in  the  allegory. 

Milton  alludes  to  the  story  of  Cupid  and  Psyche  in  the  con- 
clusion of  his  **  Comus  "  : — 

**  Celestial  Cupid,  her  famed  son,  advanced, 
Holds  his  dear  Psyche  sweet  entranced,

CHAPTER  XII. 

Cad'mus — The  Myr'mi-dons. 

Jupiter,  under  the  disguise  of  a  bull,  had  carried  away  Ec 
ropa,  the  daughter  of  Agenor,  king  of  Phoenicia.  Agenor  coir, 
manded  his  son  Cad'mus  to  go  in  search  of  his  sister,  and  nol 
to  return  without  her.  Cadmus  went  and  sought  long  and  fa^ 
for  his  sister,  but  could  not  find  her,  and  not  daring  to  returc 
unsuccessful,  consulted  the  oracle  of  Apollo  to  know  what  coun* 
try  he  should  settle  in.  The  oracle  informed  him  that  he  should 
find  a  cow  in  the  field,  and  should  follow  her  wherever  she 
might  wander,  and  where  she  stopped  should  build  a  city  and 
call  it  Thebes.  Cadmus  had  hardly  left  the  Castalian  cave,  from 
vhich  the  oracle  was  delivered,  when  he  saw  a  young  cow  slowly 
yalking  before  him.  He  followed  her  close,  offering  at  the 
same  time  his  prayers  to  Phoebus.  The  cow  went  on  til'  sle 
passed  the  shallow  channel  of  Cephisus  and  came  out  into  the 
plain  of  Panope.  There  she  stood  still,  and  raising  her  broad 
forehead  to  the  sky,  filled  the  air  with  her  lowings.  Cadmus  gave 
thanks,  and  stooping  down  kissed  the  foreign  soi^,  then  lifting

ti  libation.  Near  by  there  stood  an  ancient  grove  which  had 
never  been  profaned  by  the  axe,  in  the  midst  of  which  was  a 
cave,  thick  covered  with  the  growth  of  bushes,  its  roof  forming  a 
low  arch,  from  beneath  which  burst  forth  a  fountain  of  pures* 
water.  In  the  cave  lurked  a  horrid  serpent,  with  a  crested 
head  and  scales  glittering  like  gold.  His  eyes  shone  like  fire, 
his  body  was  swollen  with  venom,  he  vibrated  a  triple  tongue, 
fuid  showed  a  triple  row  of  teeth.  No  sooner  had  the  Tyriam 
dipped  their  pitchers  in  the  fountain,  and  the  ingushing  waters 
made  a  sound,  than  the  glittering  serpent  raised  his  head  out  of 
the  cave  and  uttered  a  fearful  hiss.  The  vessels  fell  from  their 
hands,  the  blood  left  their  cheeks,  they  trembled  in  every  limb. 
The  serpent,  twisting  his  scaly  body  in  a  huge  coil,  raised  his 
head  so  as  to  overtop  the  tallest  trees,  and  while  the  Tyrians 
from  terror  could  neither  fight  nor  fly,  slew  some  with  his  fangs, 
others  in  his  folds,  and  others  with  his  poisonous  breath. 

Cadmus  having  waited  for  the  return  of  his  men  till  midday, 
went  in  search  of  them.  His  covering  was  a  lion's  hide,  and 
besides  his  javelin  he  carried  in  his  hand  a  lance,  and  in  his 
breast  a  bold  heart,  a  surer  reliance  than  either.  When  he  en- 
tered the  wood  and  saw  the  lifeless  bodies  of  his  men,  and  the 
monster  with  his  bloody  jaws,  he  exclaimed,  **  O  faithful  friends, 
I  will  avenge  you  or  share  your  death. ' '  So  saying,  he  lifted  a 
huge  stone  and  threw  it  with  all  his  force  at  the  serpent.  Such 
a  block  would  have  shaken  the  wall  of  a  fortress,  but  it  made  no 
impression  on  the  monster.  Cadmus  next  threw  his  javelin, 
which  met  with  better  success,  for  it  penetrated  the  serpent's 
scales,  and  pierced  through  to  his  entrails.  Fierce  with  pain 
the  monster  turned  back  his  head  to  view  the  wound,  and  at- 
tempted to  draw  out  the  weapon  with  his  mouth,  but  broke  it 
i^ff,  leaving  the  iron  point  rankling  in  his  flesh.  His  neck 
swelled  with  rage,  bloody  foam  covered  his  jaws,  and  the  breath 
of  his  nostrils  poisoned  the  air.  Now  he  twisted  himself  into  a 
circle,  then  stretched  himself  out  on  the  ground  like  the  trunk 
of  a  fallen  tree.  As  he  moved  onward,  Cadmus  retreated  before 
him,  holding  his  spear  opposite  to  the  monster's  opened  jaws. 
The  serpent  snapped  at  the  weapon  and  attempted  to  bite  its 
iron  point.  At  last  Cadmus,  watching  his  chance,  thrust  the  spear 
Kl  a  moment   when   the   animal's   head,  thrown  back,    came

against  the  trunk  of  a  tree,  and  so  succeeded  in  pinning  him  to 
its  side.  His  weight  bent  the  tree  as  he  struggled  in  the  agonies 
of  death. 

While  Cadmus  stood  over  his  conquered  foe,  contemplating 
its  vast  size,  a  voice  was  heard  (from  whence  he  knew  not,  but 
he  heard  it  distinctly)  commanding  him  to  take  the  dragon's 
teeth  and  sow  them  in  the  earth.  He  obeyed.  He  made  a 
furrow  in  the  ground,  and  planted  the  teeth,  destined  to  pro* 
duce  a  crop  of  men.  Scarce  had  he  done  so  when  the  clods  be- 
gan  to  move,  and  the  points  of  spears  to  appear  above  the  sur- 
face. Next  helmets  with  their  nodding  plumes  came  up,  and 
next  the  shoulders  and  breasts  and  limbs  of  men  with  weapons, 
and  in  time  a  harvest  of  armed  warriors.  Cadmus,  alarmed,  pre- 
pared to  encounter  a  new  enemy,  but  one  of  them  said  to  him, 
**  Meddle  not  with  our  civil  war.'*  With  that,  he  who  had 
spoken  smote  one  of  his  earth-born  brothers  with  a  sword,  and 
he  himself  fell  pierced  with  an  arrow  from  another.  The  latter 
fell  victim  to  a  fourth,  and  in  like  manner  the  whole  crowd  dealt 
with  each  other  till  all  fell  slain  with  mutual  wounds  except  five 
survivors.  One  of  these  cast  away  his  weapons  and  said, 
*'  Brothers,  let  us  live  in  peace  I"  These  five  joined  with  Cad- 
mus in  building  his  city,  to  which  they  gave  the  name  of 
Thebes. 

Cadmus  obtained  in  marriage  Harmonia,  the  daughter  of 
Venus.  The  gods  left  Olympus  to  honor  the  occasion  with  their 
presence,  and  Vulcan  presented  the  bride  with  a  necklace  of  sur- 
passing brilliancy,  his  own  workmanship.  But  a  fatality  hung  over 
the  family  of  Cadmus  in  consequence  of  his  killing  the  serpent 
sacred  to  Mars.  Semele  and  Ino,  his  daughters,  and  Actaeon 
and  Pentheus,  his  grandchildren,  all  perished  unhappily,  and 
Cadmus  and  Harmonia  quitted  Thebes,  now  grown  odious  to 
them,  and  emigrated  to  the  country  of  the  Enchelians,  who  re-^ 
ceived  them  with  honor  and  made  Cadmus  their  king.  But  the 
misfortunes  of  their  children  still  weighed  upon  their  minds ; 
and  one  day  Cadmus  exclaimed,  **  If  a  serpent's  life  is  so  dear  to 
the  gods,  I  would  I  were  myself  a  serpent. ' '  No  sooner  had  he 
uttered  the  words  than  he  began  to  change  his  form.  Harmonia 
beheld  it  and  prayed  to  the  gods  to  let  her  share  his  fate.  Both 
became  serpents.     They  live  in  the  woods,  but  mindful  of  theii

origin,  they  neither  avoid  the  presence  of  man  nor  do  Ihey  evei 
injure  any  one. 

There  is  a  tradition  that  Cadmus  introduced  into  Greece  th€ 
letters  of  the  alphabet  which  were  invented  by  the  Phoenicians, 
This  is  alluded  to  by  Byron  where,  addressing  the  modern  Greeks, 
he  says: — 

"  You  have  the  letters  Cadmus  gave. 
Think  you  he  meant  them  for  a  slave  ?'* 

Milton,  describing  the  serpent  which  tempted  Eve,  is  remmded 
of  the  serpents  of  the  classical  stories,  and  says: — 


« 


— —  pleasing  was  his  shape, 
And  lovely :  never  since  of  serpent  kind 
Lovelier  ;  not  those  that  in  Illyria  changed 
Herraione  and  Cadmus,  nor  the  god 
In  Epidaurus." 

For  an  explanation  of  the  last  allusion  see  Epidaurus. 

The  Myr'mi-dons. 

The  Myr'mi-dons  were  the  soldiers  of  Achilles,  in  the  Trojan 
war.  From  them  all  zealous  and  unscrupulous  followers  of  a 
political  chief  are  called  by  that  name,  down  to  this  day.  But 
the  origin  of  the  Myrmidons  would  not  give  one  the  idea  of  a 
fierce  and  bloody  race,  but  rather  of  a  laborious  and  peaceful 
one. 

Cephalus,  king  of  Athens,  arrived  in  the  island  of  -^gina  to 
seek  assistance  of  his  old  friend  and  ally  ^acus,  the  king,  in  his 
war  with  Minos,  king  of  Crete.  Cephalus  was  most  kindly  re- 
ceived, and  the  desired  assistance  readily  promised.  '*  I  have 
people  enough,'*  said  ^acus,  **  to  protect  myself  and  spare  you 
)Uch  a  force  as  you  need."  *' I  rejoice  to  see  it,'*  replied 
Cephalus,  **and  my  wonder  has  been  raised,  I  confess,  to  find 
such  a  host  of  youths  as  I  see  around  me,  all  apparently  of  about 
the  same  age.  Yet  there  are  many  individuals  whom  I  previ- 
ously knew,  that  I  look  for  now  in  vain.  What  has  become  of 
them?"  ^acus  groaned,  and  replied  with  a  voice  of  sadness, 
**  I  have  been  intending  to  tell  you,  and  will  now  do  so,  with* 
out  more  delay,  that  you  may  see  how  from  the  saddest  begin* 
fiing  a  happy  result  sometimes  flows.     Those  whom  you  fona'

erly  knew  are  now  dust  and  ashes !  A  plague  sent  by  angry 
Juno  devastated  the  land.  She  hated  it  because  it  bore  the  name 
of  one  of  her  husband's  female  favorites.  While  the  disease  ap- 
peared to  spring  from  natural  causes  we  resisted  it  as  we  best 
might,  by  natural  remedies ;  but  it  soon  appeared  that  the  pesti* 
lence  was  too  powerful  for  our  efforts,  and  we  yielded.  At  the 
beginning  the  sky  seemed  to  settle  down  upon  the  earth,  and 
thick  clouds  shut  in  the  heated  air.  For  four  months  together 
a  deadly  south  wind  prevailed.  The  disorder  affected  the  wells 
and  springs ;  thousands  of  snakes  crept  over  the  land  and  shed 
their  poison  in  the  fountains.  The  force  of  the  disease  was  first 
spent  on  the  lower  animals,  dogs,  cattle,  sheep,  and  birds.  The 
luckless  ploughman  wondered  to  see  his  oxen  fall  in  the  midst 
of  their  work,  and  lie  helpless  in  the  unfinished  furrow.  The 
wool  fell  from  the  bleating  sheep,  and  their  bodies  pined  away. 
The  horse  once  foremost  in  the  race  contested  the  palm  no  more, 
but  groaned  in  his  stall  and  died  an  inglorious  death.  The  wild 
boar  forgot  his  rage,  the  stag  his  swiftness,  the  bears  no  longei 
attacked  the  herds.  Everything  languished ;  dead  bodies  lay 
in  the  roads,  the  fields,  and  the  woods ;  the  air  was  poisoned  by 
them.  I  tell  you  what  is  hardly  credible,  but  neither  dogs  nor 
birds  would  touch  them,  nor  starving  wolves.  Their  decay 
spread  the  infection.  Next  the  disease  attacked  the  country 
people,  and  then  the  dwellers  in  the  city.  At  first  the  cheek 
was  flushed,  and  the  breath  drawn  with  difficulty.  The  tongue 
grew  rough  and  swelled,  and  the  dry  mouth  stood  open,  with  its 
veins  enlarged,  and  gasped  for  the  air.  Men  could  not  bear  the 
heat  of  their  clothes  or  their  beds,  but  preferred  to  lie  on  the 
bare  ground ;  and  the  ground  did  not  cool  them,  but,  on  the 
contrary,  they  heated  the  spot  where  they  lay.  Nor  could  the 
physicians  help,  for  the  disease  attacked  them  also,  and  the  con- 
tact of  the  sick  gave  them  infection,  so  that  the  most  faithful 
were  the  first  victims.  At  last  all  hope  of  relief  vanished,  and 
men  learned  to  look  upon  death  as  the  only  deliverer  from  dis- 
ease. Then  they  gave  way  to  every  inclination,  and  cared  not 
to  ask  what  was  expedient,  for  nothing  was  expedient.  All 
restraint  laid  aside,  they  crowded  around  the  wells  and  fountains 
and  drank  till  they  died,  without  quenching  thirst.  Many  had 
lot  strength  to  get  away  from  the  water,  t)Tit  died  in  the  midst

of  the  stream,  and  others  would  drink  of  it  notwithstanding. 
Such  was  their  weariness  of  their  sick  beds  that  some  would 
creep  forth,  and  if  not  strong  enough  to  stand,  would  die  on  the 
ground.  They  seemed  to  hate  their  friends,  and  got  away  from 
their  homes,  as  if,  not  knowing  the  cause  of  their  sickness,  they 
charged  it  on  the  place  of  their  abode.  Some  were  seen  totter- 
ing along  the  road,  as  long  as  they  could  stand,  while  others 
sank  on  the  earth  and  turned  their  dying  eyes  around  to  take  a 
last  look,  then  closed  them  in  death. 

**What  heart  had  I  left  me,  during  all  this,  or  what  ought  I 
to  have  had,  except  to  hate  life  and  wish  to  be  with  my  dead 
subjects  ?  On  all  sides  lay  my  people  strewn  like  over-ripened 
apples  beneath  the  tree,  or  acorns  under  the  storm-shaken  oak. 
You  see  yonder  a  temple  on  the  height.  It  is  sacred  to  Jupiter. 
O,  how  many  offered  prayers  there,  husbands  for  wives,  fathers  for 
sons,  and  died  in  the  very  act  of  supplication  1  How  often,  while 
the  priest  made  ready  for  sacrifice,  the  victim  fell,  struck  down 
by  disease  without  waiting  for  the  blow  !  At  length  all  rever- 
ence for  sacred  things  was  lost.  Bodies  were  thrown  out  un- 
buried,  wood  was  wanting  for  funeral  piles,  men  fought  with  one 
another  for  the  possession  of  them.  Finally  there  was  none  left 
to  mourn ;  sons  and  husbands,  old  men  and  youths,  perished 
alike  unlamented. 

**  Standing  before  the  altar  I  raised  my  eyes  to  heaven.  *  O 
Jupiter,'  I  said,  *  if  thou  art  indeed  my  father,  and  art  not 
ashamed  of  thy  offspring,  give  me  back  my  people,  or  take  me 
also  away  !'  At  these  words  a  clap  of  thunder  was  heard.  *  1 
accept  the  omen,'  I  cried ;  *  O,  may  it  be  a  sign  of  a  favorable 
disposition  towards  me  !'  By  chance  there  grew  by  the  place 
where  1  stood  an  oak  with  wide-spreading  branches,  sacred  to 
Jupiter.  I  observed  a  troop  of  ants  busy  with  their  labor,  carry- 
ing minute  grains  in  their  mouths  and  following  one  another  in 
a  line  up  the  trunk  of  the  tree.  Observing  their  numbers  with 
admiration  I  said,  *  Give  me,  O  father,  citizens  as  numerous  as 
these,  and  replenish  my  empty  city.*  The  tree  shook  and  gave 
a  rustling  sound  with  its  branches  though  no  wind  agitated  them. 
I  trembled  in  every  limb,  yet  I  kissed  the  earth  and  the  tree.  I 
would  not  confess  to  myself  that  I  hoped,  yet  I  did  hope.  Night 
came  on  and  sleep  took  possession  of  my  frame,  oppressed  with

cares.  The  tree  stood  before  me  in  my  dreams,  with  its  numer- 
ous branches  all  covered  with  living,  moving  creatures.  It 
seemed  to  shake  its  limbs  and  throw  down  over  the  ground  a 
multitude  of  those  industrious  grain -gathering  animals,  which 
appeared  to  gain  in  size,  and  grow  larger  and  larger,  andby-and- 
by  to  stand  erect,  lay  aside  their  superfluous  legs  and  their  black 
color,  and  finally  to  assume  the  human  form.  Then  I  awoke, 
and  my  first  impulse  was  to  chide  the  gods  who  had  robbed  me 
of  a  sweet  vision  and  given  me  no  reality  in  its  place.  Being 
still  in  the  temple,  my  attention  was  caught  by  the  sound  of  many 
voices  without ;  a  sound  of  late  unusual  to  my  ears.  While  I 
began  to  think  I  was  yet  dreaming,  Telamon,  my  son,  throwing 
open  the  temple-gates,  exclaimed,  *  Father  approach,  and  behold 
things  surpassing  even  your  hopes  !'  I  went  forth  ;  I  saw  a  mul- 
titude of  men,  such  as  I  had  seen  in  my  dream,  and  they  were 
passing  in  procession  in  the  same  manner.  While  I  gazed  with 
wonder  and  delight  they  approached,  and  kneeling  hailed  me  as 
their  king.  I  paid  my  vows  to  Jove,  and  proceeded  to  allot  the 
vacant  city  to  the  new-born  race,  and  to  parcel  out  the  fields 
among  them.  I  called  them  Myrmidons,  from  the  ant  (myr- 
mex) ,  from  which  they  sprang.  You  have  seen  these  persons ; 
their  dispositions  resemble  those  which  they  had  in  their  former 
shape.  They  are  a  diligent  and  industrious  race,  eager  to  gain, 
and  tenacious  of  their  gains.  Among  them  you  may  recruit 
your  forces.  They  will  follow  you  to  the  war,  young  in  years 
asid  bold  in  heart.'* 

**  *No  !  No  !'  said  Rhadamant,  *  it  were  not  well 
With  loving  souls  to  place  a  martialist ; 
He  died  in  war,  and  must  to  martial  fields, 
Where  wounded  Hector  hves  in  lasting  pain, 
And  Achilles'  Myrmidons  do  scour  the  plain.'  '*

CHAPTER  XIII. 

Ni'sus  and  Scyl'la — Ech'o  and  Nar  cis'sus — Clyt'i-e— 

He'ro  and  Le-an'der. 

Ni'sus  and  Scyl'la. 

Minos,  king  of  Crete,  made  war  upon  Megara.  Ni'sus  was 
king  of  Megara,  and  Scyl'la  was  his  daughter.  The  siege  had 
now  lasted  six  months,  and  the  city  still  held  out,  for  it  was  de- 
creed by  fate  that  it  should  not  be  taken  so  long  as  a  certain 
purple  lock,  which  glittered  among  the  hair  of  King  Nisus,  re- 
mained on  his  head.  There  was  a  tower  on  the  city  walls  which 
overlooked  the  plain  where  Minos  and  his  army  were  encamped. 
To  this  tower  Scylla  used  to  repair,  and  look  abroad  over  the 
tents  of  the  hostile  army.  The  siege  had  lasted  so  long  that 
she  had  learned  to  distinguish  the  persons  of  the  leaders.  Minos, 
in  particular,  excited  her  admiration.  Arrayed  in  his  hemlet, 
and  bearing  his  shield,  she  admired  his  graceful  deportment ;  if 
he  threw  his  javelin,  skill  seemed  combined  with  force  in  the 
discharge ;  if  he  drew  his  bow,  Apollo  himself  could  not  have 
done  it  more  gracefully.  But  when  he  laid  aside  his  helmet, 
and  in  his  purple  robes  bestrode  his  white  horse  with  its  gay 
caparisons,  and  reined-in  its  foaming  mouth,  the  daughter  of 
Nisus  was  hardly  mistress  of  herself;  she  was  almost  frantic  with 
admiration.  She  envied  the  weapon  that  he  grasped,  the  reins 
■hat  he  held.  She  felt  as  if  she  could,  if  it  were  possible,  go  to 
nim  through  the  hostile  ranks  ;  she  felt  an  impulse  to  cast  her- 
self down  from  the  tower  into  the  midst  of  his  camp,  or  to  open 
the  gates  to  him,  or  to  do  anything  else,  so  only  it  might  gratify 
Minos.  As  she  sat  in  the  tower,  she  talked  thus  with  herself: 
"I  know  not  whether  to  rejoice  or  grieve  at  this  sad  war.  I 
grieve  that  Minos  is  our  enemy,  but  I  rejoice  at  any  cause  that 
brings  him  to  my  sight.  Perhaps  he  would  be  willing  to  grant 
us  peace,  and  receive  me  as  a  hostage.     I  would  fly  down,  if  I 


JflSUS  AND  SCTLUL  1 2 1 

could,  and  alight  in  his  camp,  and  tell  him  that  we  yield  our- 
selves to  his  mercy.  But  then,  to  betray  my  father  !  No  I  rather 
would  I  never  see  Minos  again.  And  yet  no  doubt  it  is  some 
times  the  best  thing  for  a  city  to  be  conquered,  when  the  con- 
queror is  clement  and  generous.  Minos  certainly  has  right  on 
his  side.  I  think  we  shall  be  conquered ;  and  if  that  must  be 
the  end  of  it,  why  should  not  love  unbar  the  gates  to  him,  in- 
stead of  leaving  it  to  be  done  by  war  ?  Better  spare  delay  and 
f laughter  if  we  can.  And  O,  if  any  one  should  wound  or  kill 
Minos  !  No  one  surely  would  have  the  heart  to  do  it ;  yet  ignor- 
antly,  not  knowing  him,  one  might.  I  will,  I  will  surrender 
myself  to  him,  with  my  country  as  a  dowry,  and  so  put  an  end  to 
the  war.  But  how?  The  gates  are  guarded,  and  my  fathei 
keeps  the  keys ;  he  only  stands  in  my  way.  O  that  it  might 
please  the  gods  to  take  him  away  !  But  why  ask  the  gods  to 
do  it  ?  Another  woman,  loving  as  I  do,  would  remove  with  her 
own  hands  whatever  stood  in  the  way  of  her  love.  And  can 
any  other  woman  dare  more  than  I  ?  I  would  encounter  fire 
and  sword  to  gain  my  object ;  but  here  there  is  no  need  of  fire 
and  sword.  I  only  need  my  father's  purple  lock.  More  pre- 
cious than  gold  to  me,  that  will  give  me  all  I  wish." 

While  she  thus  reasoned  night  came  on,  and  soon  the  whole 
palace  was  buried  in  sleep.  She  entered  her  father's  bedcham- 
ber and  cut  off  the  fatal  lock,  then  passed  out  of  the  city  and 
entered  the  enemy's  camp.  She  demanded  to  be  led  to  the 
king,  and  thus  addressed  him  :  "I  am  Scylla,  the  daughter  of 
Nisus.  I  surrender  to  you  my  country  and  my  father's  house. 
I  ask  no  reward  but  yourself ;  for  love  of  you  I  have  done  it. 
See  here  the  purple  lock  !  With  this  I  give  you  my  father  and 
his  kingdom."  She  held  out  her  hand  with  the  fatal  spoil. 
Minos  shrunk  back  and  refused  to  touch  it.  **  The  gods  de- 
stroy thee,  infamous  woman  !"  he  exclaimed;  "disgrace  of  our 
lime  I  May  neither  earth  nor  sea  yield  thee  a  resting-place  1 
Surely,  my  Crete,  where  Jove  himself  was  cradled,  shall  not  be 
polluted  with  such  a  monster  !"  Thus  he  said,  and  gave  orders 
that  equitable  terms  should  be  allowed  to  the  conquered  city, 
and  that  the  fleet  should  immediately  sail  from  the  island. 

Scylla  was  frantic.  "Ungrateful  man!"  she  exclaimed,  **is 
tt  thus  you  leave  me  ? — me  who  have  given  you  victoiry — who

have  sacrificed  for  you  parent  and  country  1  I  am  guilty,  1 
confess,  and  deserve  to  die,  but  not  by  your  hand.**  As  the 
ships  left  the  shore  she  leaped  into  the  water,  and  seizing  the 
rudder  of  the  on.'  which  carried  Minos,  she  was  borne  along 
an  unwelcomed  companion  of  their  course.  A  sea-eagle  soaring 
aloft — it  was  her  father  who  had  been  changed  into  that  form — 
seeing  her,  pounced  down  upon  her,  and  struck  her  with  his  beak 
and  claws.  In  terror  she  let  go  the  ship,  and  would  have  fallen 
into  the  water,  but  some  pitying  deity  changed  her  into  a  bird, 
rhe  sea- eagle  still  cherishes  the  old  animosity  ;  and  whenever  he 
espies  her  in  his  lofty  flight,  you  may  see  him  dart  down  upon 
her,  with  beak  and  claws,  to  take  vengeance  for  the  ancient 
crime. 

Ech'o  and  Nar-cis'sus. 

Ech'o  was  a  beautiful  nymph,  fond  of  the  woods  and  hills, 
where  she  devoted  herself  to  woodland  sports.  She  was  a  favor- 
ite of  Diana,  and  attended  her  in  the  chase.  But  Echo  had  one 
failing ;  she  was  fond  of  talking,  and  whether  in  chat  or  argu- 
ment, would  have  the  last  word.  One  day  Juno  was  seeking 
her  husband,  who,  she  had  reason  to  fear,  was  amusing  himself 
among  the  nymphs.  Echo  by  her  talk  contrived  to  detain  the 
goddess  till  the  nymphs  made  their  escape.  When  Juno  dis- 
covered it,  she  passed  sentence  upon  Echo  in  these  words : 
**  You  shall  forfeit  the  use  of  that  tongue  with  which  you  have 
cheated  me,  except  for  that  one  purpose  you  are  so  fond  of — 
re/>/y.  You  shall  still  have  the  last  word,  but  no  power  to  speak 
first" 

*•  But  her  voice  is  still  living  immortal,— 
The  same  you  have  frequently  heard 
In  your  rambles  in  valleys  and  forests. 
Repeating  your  ultimate  word." — Saxe. 

This  nymph  saw  Nar-cis'sus,  a  beautiful  youth,  as  he  pur- 
sued the  chase  upon  the  mountains.  She  loved  him,  and  fol- 
lowed his  footsteps.  O,  how  she  longed  to  address  him  in  the 
softest  accents,  and  win  him  to  converse  1  but  it  was  not  in  her 
power.  She  waited  with  impatience  for  him  to  speak  first,  and 
had  her  answer  ready.  One  day  the  youth,  being  separated  from 
his  companions,  shouted  aloud,  **  Who's  here?  "    Echo  replied,

hastened  to  the  spot,  ready  to  throw  her  arms  about  his  neck 
He  started  back,  exclaiming,  **  Hands  off  !  I  would  rather  die 
than  you  should  have  me  !"  **  Have  me,"  said  she  ;  but  it  was 
all  in  vain.  He  left  her,  and  she  went  to  hide  her  blushes  in 
the  recesses  of  the  woods.  From  that  time  forth  she  lived  in 
caves  and  among  mountain  cliffs.  Her  form  faded  with  grief, 
till  at  last  all  her  flesh  shrank  away.  Her  bones  were  changed 
into  rocks,  and  there  was  nothing  left  of  her  but  her  voice 
With  that  she  is  still  ready  to  reply  to  any  one  who  calls  her, 
and  keeps  up  her  old  habit  of  having  the  last  word. 

Narcissus's  cruelty  in  this  case  was  not  the  only  instance.  He 
shunned  all  the  rest  of  the  nymphs,  as  he  had  done  poor  Echo. 
One  day  a  maiden,  who  had  in  vain  endeavored  to  attract  him, 
uttered  a  prayer  that  he  might  some  time  or  other  feel  what  it 
was  to  love  and  meet  no  return  of  affection.  The  avenging  god- 
dess heard  and  granted  the  prayer. 

There  v/as  a  clear  fountain,  with  water  like  silver,  to  which  the 
shepherds  never  drove  their  flocks,  nor  the  mountain  goats  re- 
sorted, nor  any  of  the  beasts  of  the  forest ;  neither  was  it  defaced 
with  fallen  leaves  or  branches  ;  but  the  grass  grew  fresh  around 
it,  and  the  rocks  sheltered  it  from  the  sun. 

**  In  some  delicious  ramble,  he  had  found 
A  little  space,  with  boughs  all  woven  round ; 
And  in  the  midst  of  all,  a  clearer  pool 
Than  e'er  reflected  in  its  pleasant  cool 
The  blue  sky  here,  and  there,  serenely  peeping 
Through  tendril  wreaths  fantastically  creeping." — Keats. 

Hither  came  one  day  the  youth,  fatigued  with  hunting,  heated 
and  thirsty.  He  stooped  down  to  drink,  and  saw  his  own  image 
in  the  water ;  he  thought  it  was  some  beautiful  water-spirit  living 
in  the  fountain.  He  stood  gazing  with  admiration  at  those 
'bright  eyes,  those  locks  curled  like  the  locks  of  Bacchus  or 
Apollo,  the  rounded  cheeks,  the  ivory  neck,  the  parted  lips,  and 
the  glow  of  health  and  exercise  over  all.  He  fell  in  love  with 
himself.  He  brought  his  lips  near  to  take  a  kiss  ;  he  plunged 
his  arms  in  to  embrace  the  beloved  object.  It  fled  at  the  touch, 
but  returned  again  after  a  moment  and  renewed  the  fascination. 
He  could  not  tear  himself  away ;  he  lost  all  thought  of  food  o*

rest,  while  he  hovered  over  the  brink  of  the  fountain,  gazing 
upon  his  own  image.  He  talked  with  the  supposed  spirit : 
'*  Why,  beautiful  being,  do  you  shun  me  ?  Surely,  my  face  is  not 
one  to  repel  you.  The  nymphs  love  me,  and  you  yourself  look 
not  indifferent  upon  me.  When  I  stretch  forth  my  arms  you  do 
the  same ;  and  you  smile  upon  me 
and  answer  my  beckonings  with  the 
tike.**  His  tears  fell  into  the  water 
and  disturbed  the  image.  As  he  saw 
it  depart,  he  exclaimed,  **  Stay,  I 
entreat  you  \  Let  me  at  least  gaze 
upon  you,  if  I  may  not  touch  you. ' ' 
With  this  and  much  more  of  the 
same  kind,  he  cherished  the  flame 
that  consumed  him,  so  that  by  de- 
grees he  lost  his  color,  his  vigor, 
and  the  beauty  which  formerly  had 
so  charmed  the  nymph  Echo.  She 
kept  near  him,  however,  and  when 
he  exclaimed,  "Alas!  alas!  she 
answered  him  with  the  same  words. 
He  pined  away  and  died  ;  and  when 
his  shade  passed  the  Stygian  river,  it 
leaned  over  the  boat  to  catch  a  look 
of  itself  in  the  waters.  The  nymphs 
mourned  for  him,  especially  the 
water-nymphs ;  and  when  they  smote 
their  breasts,  Echo  smote  hers  also. 
They  prepared  a  funeral  pile,  and 
would  have  burned  the  body,  but  it 
was  nowhere  to  be  found  ;  but  in  its  place  a  flower,  purple  within, 
and  surrounded  with  white  leaves,  which  bears  the  name  anci 
preserves  the  memory  of  Narcissus. 

**  A  lonely  flower  he  spierl, 
A  meek  and  forlorn  flower,  with  naught  of  pride, 
Drooping  its  beauty  o'er  the  watery  clearness, 
To  woo  its  own  sad  image  into  nearness  : 
Deaf  to  light  Zephyrus  it  would  not  move. 
But  still  would  seem  to  droop,  to  pine,  to  love." — Keats.

126  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES. 

Milton  alludes  to  the  story  of  Echo  and  Narcissus  in  the  Lady's 
song  in  *  *  Comus. ' '  She  is  seeking  her  brothers  in  the  forest,  and 
sings  to  attract  their  attention  : — 

"  Sweet  Echo,  sweetest  nymph,  that  liv'st  unseen 
Within  thy  aery  shell 
By  slow  Meander's  margent  green, 
And  in  the  violet- embroidered  vale. 
Where  the  love-lorn  nightingale 
Nightly  to  thee  her  sad  song  mourneth  well ; 
Canst  thou  not  tell  me  of  a  gentle  pair 
That  likest  thy  Narcissus  are  ? 

O,  if  thou  have 
Hid  them  in  some  flowery  cave. 
Tell  me  but  where. 
Sweet  queen  of  parly,  daughter  of  the  sphere, 
So  may'  st  thou  be  translated  to  the  skies, 
And  give  resounding  grace  to  all  heaven's  harmonies.*' 

He  also  has  imitated  the  story  of  Narcissus  in  the  account 
which  he  makes  Eve  give  of  the  first  sight  of  herself  reflected  in 
the  fountain : — 

*'  That  day  I  oft  remember  when  from  sleep 
I  first  awaked,  and  found  myself  reposed 
Under  a  shade  on  flowers,  much  wondering  where 
And  what  I  w-as,  whence  thither  brought,  and  how. 
Not  distant  far  from  thence  a  murmuring  sound 
Of  waters  issued  from  a  cave,  and  spread 
Into  a  liquid  plain,  then  stood  unmoved 
Pure  as  the  expanse  of  heaven  ;  I  thither  went 
With  unexperienced  thought,  and  laid  me  down 
On  the  green  banks  to  look  into  the  clear 
Smooth  lake  that  to  me  seemed  another  sky. 
As  I  bent  down  to  look,  just  opposite 
A  shape  within  the  watery  gleam  appeared. 
Bending  to  look  on  me.     I  started  back  ; 
It  started  back ;  but  pleased  I  soon  returned. 
Pleased  it  returned  as  soon,  with  answering  looks 
Of  sympathy  and  love.     There  had  I  fixed 
Mine  eyes  till  now,  and  pined  with  vain  desire, 
Had  not  a  voice  thus  warned  me  :  *  What  thou  seest. 
What  there  thou  seest,  fair  creature,  is  thyself.*  "

No  one  of  the  fables  of  antiquity  has  been  oftener  alluded  to 


ECHO  AND  NAECISSUS.  12; 

by  the  poets  than  that  of  Narcissus.  The  poets  have  taken  great 
license  with  Echo  and  Narcissus.  The  following  is  from  Gold- 
smith : — 

"ON   A    BEAUTIFUL   YOUTH,    STRUCK    BLIND    BY    LIGHTNING." 

••  Sure  'twas  by  Providence  designed. 
Rather  in  pity  than  in  hate, 
That  he  should  be  like  Cupid  blind, 
To  save  him  from  Narcissus'  fate.'* 

Clyt'i-e. 

Clyf  i-e  was  a  water-nymph  and  in  love  with  Apollo,  who  made 
her  no  return.  So  she  pined  away,  sitting  all  day  long  upon  the 
cold  ground,  with  her  unbound  tresses  streaming  over  her 
shoulders.  Nine  days  she  sat  and  tasted  neither  food  nor  drink, 
her  own  tears  and  the  chilly  dew  her  only  food.  She  gazed  on 
the  sun  when  he  rose,  and  as  he  passed  through  his  daily  course 
to  his  setting ;  she  saw  no  other  object ;  her  face  turned  constantly 
on  him.  At  last,  they  say,  her  limbs  rooted  in  the  ground,  her 
face  became  a  flower,^  which  turns  on  its  stem  so  as  always  to 
face  the  sun  throughout  its  daily  course  ;  for  it  retains  to  that 
extent  the  feeling  of  the  nymph  from  whom  it  sprang. 

Hood  in  his  *'  Flowers'*  thus  alludes  to  Clytie  ;— 

•*  I  will  not  have  the  mad  Clytie, 

Whose  head  is  turned  by  the  sun  ; 
The  tulip  is  a  courtly  quean. 

Whom  therefore  I  will  shim  ; 
The  cowshp  is  a  country  wench. 

The  violet  is  a  nun  ; — 
But  I  will  woo  the  dainty  rose. 

The  queen  of  every  one." 

The  sunflower  is  a  favorite  emblem  of  constancy.     Thus  Moore 

uses  it : — 

**  The  heart  that  has  truly  loved  never  forgets, 
But  as  truly  loves  on  to  the  close ; 
As  the  sunflower  turns  on  her  god  when  he  sets 
The  same  look  that  she  turned  when  he  rose.'* 

*  The  belief  that  the  sunflower  turns  on  its  stem  so  as  alway?  to  face  the  mn 
U  not  sirictly  true  Its  name  was  derived  from  a  fancied  resamblance  to  the 
ladiant  beams  of  the  sun  rather  than  from  anj  habit  of  constancv.

He'ro  and  Le-an'der. 
Le-an'der  was  a  youth  of  Abydos,  a  town  of  the  Asian  sidt 
of  the  strait  which  separates  Asia  and  Europe.     On  the  opposite 
shore,  in  the  town  of  Sestos,  lived  the  maiden  He'ro,  apriesteas 
of  Venus.

Leander  loved  her,  and  used  to  swim  the  strait  nightly  to  en- 
joy the  company  of  his  mistress,  guided  by  a  torch  which  she 
reared  upon  the  tower  for  the  purpose.  But  one  night  a  tem«

was  drowned.

*  To  night,'  he  said,  tenderly,  *  living  or  dead. 
Sweet  Hero,  I'll  rest  with  thee.' 

"  But  fiercer  around  him  the  wild  waves  speed. 
Oh  Love,  in  that  hour  of  votary's  need, 

Where,  where  could  thy  spirit  be? 
He  struggles — he  sinks — while  the  hurricane's  breath 
Beats  rudely  away  his  last  farewell  in  death —

That  hand,  whose  motion  is  not  life.

Flung  by  the  tossing  tide  on  high.

IJO  STORIES  OF  OODS  AND  HEROES. 

In  her  despair  she  cast  herself  down  from  the  tower  into  the 
Bea  and  perished. 

The  story  of  Leander's  swimming  the  Hellespont  was  looked 
upon  as  fabulous,  and  the  feat  considered  impossible,  till  Lord 
Byron  proved  its  possibility  by  performing  it  himself.  In  the 
»**  Bride  of  Abydos  *'  he  says  : — 

"  These  limbs  that  buoyant  wave  hath  borne.** 

The  distance  in  the  narrowest  part  is  almost  a  mile,  and  there 
is  a  constant  current  setting  out  from  the  Sea  of  Marmora  into 
the  Archipelago.  Since  Byron's  time  the  feat  has  been  achieved 
by  others ;  but  it  yet  remains  a  test  of  strength  and  skill  in  the  art 
of  swimming  sufficient  to  give  a  wide  and  lasting  celebrity  to 
any  one  of  our  readers  who  may  dare  to  make  the  attempt  and 
succeed  in  accomplishing  it. 

In  the  beginning  of  the  second  canto  of  the  same  poem,  Byron 
thus  alludes  to  this  story  : — 

**The  winds  are  high  on  Helle's  wave. 

As  on  that  night  of  stormiest  water. 
When  Love,  who  sent,  forgot  to  save 
The  young,  the  beautiful,  the  brave, 

The  lonely  hope  of  Sestos'  daughter. 
Oh,  when  alone  along  the  sky 
The  turret-torch  was  blazing  high. 
Though  rising  gale  and  breaking  foam. 
And  shrieking  sea-birds  warned  him  home ; 
And  clouds  aloft  and  tides  below. 
With  signs  and  sounds  forbade  to  go. 
He  could  not  see,  he  would  not  hear 
Or  sound  or  sight  foreboding  fear. 
His  eye  but  saw  that  light  of  love, 
The  only  star  it  hailed  above ; 
His  ear  but  rang  with  Hero's  song, 
*  Ye  waves,  divide  not  lovers  long.* 
That  tale  is  old,  but  love  anew 
May  nerve  young  hearts  to  prove  m  true.**

CHAPTER  XIV. 

Mi-ner'va — Mars — A-rach'ne — Ni'o-be. 

Mi-ner'va. 

Mi-ner'va,  the  goddess  of  wisdom,  was  the  daughter  of  Jupi- 
ter. She  was  said  to  have  leaped  forth  from  his  brain,  mature, 
and  in  complete  armor. 

**  From  his  awful  head 
Whom  Jove  brought  forth,  in  warhke  armor  drest. 
Golden,  all  radiant." — ShelleY. 

She  presided  over  the  useful  and  ornamental  arts,  both  those 
of  men — such  as  agriculture  and  navigation — and  those  of 
women — spinning,  weaving  and  needlework.  She  was  also  a 
warlike  divinity ;  but  it  was  defensive  war  only  that  she  patron- 
ized, and  she  had  no  sympathy  with  Mars' s  savage  love  of  vio- 
lence and  bloodshed. 

Mars  delighted  in  war  for  the  sake  of  itself.  It  was  never 
the  purpose  but  always  the  conflict  that  gave  him  pleasure.  He 
had  five  attendants,  Eris  (Discord),  Phobos  (Alarm),  Metis 
(Fear),  Demios  (Dread),  and  Pallor  (Terror).  These  were 
his  body-guard.  The  war  goddess  Bellona,  or  Enyo,  was  also 
associated  with  him.  Their  altars  were  side  by  side  in  the  tem- 
ple, and  each  was  stained  by  human  sacrifices. 

•*And  to  the  fire-eyed  maid  of  smoky  war. 
All  hot  and  bleeding,  will  we  offer  them ; 
The  mailed  Mars  shall  on  his  altar  sit 
Up  to  the  ears  in  blood." — Shakespeare. 

It  is  not  strange,  therefore,  that  Minerva,  the  goddess  of  wis- 
dom, should  have  entertained  but  little  respect  for  this  bloody 
deity. 

Athens  was  her  chosen  seat,  her  own  city,  awarded  to  her  as 
the  prize  of  a  contest  with  Neptune,  who  also  aspired  to  it.  The 


132 


STORIES  OF  GOBS  AND  HEROES, 


tale  ran  that  in  the  reign  of  Cecrops,  the  first  king  of  Athens,  the 
two  deities  contended  for  the  possession  of  the  city.  The  gods 
decreed  that  it  should  be  awarded  to  that  one  who  produced  the 
gift  most  useful  to  mortals.  Neptune  gave  the  horse  ;  Minerva 
produced  the  olive.  The  gods  gave  judgment  that  the  olive 
\was  the  more  useful  of  the  two,  and  awarded  the  city  to  the  god- 
dess ;  and  it  was  named 
after  her,  Athens,  her  name 
in  Greek  being  Athene. 

There  was  another  con- 
test, in  which  a  mortal  dared 
to  come  in  competition  with 
Minerva.  That  mortal  was 
A-rach'ne,  a  maiden  who 
had  attained  such  skill  in 
the  arts  of  weaving  and  em- 
broidery that  the  Nymphs 
themselves  would  leave  their 
groves  and  fountains  to  come 
and  gaze  upon  her  work.  It 
was  not  only  beautiful  when 
it  was  done,  but  beautiful 
also  in  the  doing.  To  watch 
her,  as  she  took  the  wool  in 
its  rude  state  and  formed  it 
into  rolls,  or  separated  it 
\vith  her  fingers  and  carded 
it  till  it  looked  as  light  and 
soft  as  a  cloud,  or  twirled 
the  spindle  with  skillful 
touch,  or  wove  the  web,  or, 
after  it  was  woven,  adorned 
it  with  her  needle,  one 
would  have  said  that  Minerva  herself  had  taught  her.  But  this 
she  denied,  and  could  not  bear  to  be  thought  a  pupil  even 
of  a  goddess.  **  Let  Minerva  try  her  skill  with  mine,"  said  she  ; 
**if  beaten.  Twill  pay  the  penalty."  Minerva  heard  this  and 
was  displeased.  She  assumed  the  form  of  an  old  woman,  and 
went  and  gave  Arachne  some  friendly  advice.      **  I  have  had

much  experience,"  said  she,  "and  I  hope  you  will  not  despise 
my  counsel.  Challenge  your  fellow-mortals  as  you  will,  but  do 
not  compete  with  a  goddess.  On  the  contrary,  I  advise  you 
to  ask  her  forgiveness  for  what  you  have  said,  and  as  she  is 
merciful,  perhaps  she  will  pardon  you."  Arachne  stopped  her 
spinning,  and  looked  at  the  old  dame  with  anger  in  her  counte- 
nance. **Keep  your  counsel,"  said  she,  **for  your  daughters 
or  handmaids ;  for  my 
part,  I  know  what  I  say, 
and  I  stand  to  it.  I  am 
not  afraid  of  the  goddess  ; 
let  her  try  her  skill,  if  she 
dare  venture."  *^She 
comes,"  said  Minerva; 
and  dropping  her  disguise, 
stood  confessed.  The 
Nymphs  bent  low  in  hom- 
age, and  all  the  bystanders 
paid  reverence.  Arachne 
alone  was  unterrified.  She 
blushed,  indeed ;  a  sud- 
den color  dyed  her  cheek, 
and  then  she  grew  pale. 
But  she  stood  to  her  re- 
solve, and  with  a  foolish 
conceit  of  her  own  skill 
rushed  on  her  fate.  Mi- 
nerva forbore  no  longer, 
nor  interposed  any  further 
advice.  They  proceed  to

the  web  to  the  beam.  Then  the  slender  shuttle  is  passed  irf 
and  out  among  the  threads.  The  reed  with  its  fine  teeth  strikes 
up  the  woof  into  its  place  and  compacts  the  web.  Both  work 
with  speed ;  their  skillful  hands  move  rapidly,  and  the  excite- 
ment of  the  contest  makes  the  labor  light.  Wool  of  Tyrian

bow,  whose  long  arch  tinges  the  heavens,  formed  by  sunbeams 
reflected  from  the  shower/  in  which,  where  the  colors  m.eet  they 
seem  as  one,  but  a  little  distance  from  the  point  of  contact  are 
wholly  different. 

Minerva  wrought  on  her  web  the  scene  of  her  contest  with 
Neptune.  Twelve  of  the  heavenly  powers  are  represented,  Jupi* 
ter,  with  august  gravity,  sitting  in  the  midst.  Neptune,  the 
ruler  of  the  sea,  holds  his  trident,  and  appears  to  have  just  smit- 
ten the  earth,  from  which  a  horse  has  leaped  forth.  Minerva 
depicted  herself  with  helmed  head,  her  ^gis  covering  her  breast. 
Such  was  the  central  circle  ;  and  in  the  four  corners  were  repre- 
sented incidents  illustrating  the  displeasure  of  the  gods  at  such 
presumptuous  mortals  as  had  dared  to  contend  with  them.  These 
were  meant  as  warnings  to  her  rival  to  give  up  the  contest  be- 
fore it  was  too  late. 

Arachne  filled  her  web  with  subjects  designedly  chosen  to  ex- 
hibit the  failings  and  errors  of  the  gods.  One  scene  represented 
Leda  caressing  the  swan,  under  which  form  Jupiter  had  dis- 
guised himself;  and  another,  Danae,  in  the  brazen  tower  in 
which  her  father  had  imprisoned  her,  but  where  the  god  effected 
his  entrance  in  the  form  of  a  golden  shower.  Still  another  de- 
picted Europa  deceived  by  Jupiter  under  the  disguise  of  a  bull. 
Encouraged  by  the  tameness  of  the  animal,  Europa  ventured  to 
mount  his  back,  whereupon  Jupiter  advanced  into  the  sea,  and 
swam  with  her  to  Crete. 

"  Sweet  Europa' s  mantle  blew  unclaps'd. 
From  off  her  shoulder  backward  borne  : 
From  one  hand  droop' d  a  crocus  ;  one  hand  grasp' d 
The  mild  bull's  golden  horn." — Tennyson. 

You  would  have  thought  it  was  a  real  bull,  so  naturally  was  it 
wrought,  and  so  natural  the  water  in  which  it  swam.  She 
seemed  to  look  with  longing  eyes  back  upon  the  shore  she  was 
leaving,  and  to  call  to  her  companions  for  help.  She  appeared 
to  shudder  with  terror  at  the  sight  of  the  heaving  waves,  and  to 
draw  back  her  feet  from  the  water. 

Arachne  filled  her  canvas  with  similar  subjects,  wonderfully

we]\  done,  but  strongly  marking  her  presumption  and  impiety. 
Minerva  could  not  forbear  to  admire,  yet  felt  indignant  at  .he  in- 
sult. She  struck  the  web  with  her  shuttle,  and  rent  it  in  pieces ; 
she  then  touched  the  forehead  of  Arachne,  and  made  her  feel 
her  guilt  and  shame.  She  could  not  endure  it,  and  went  and 
hanged  herself.  Minerva  pitied  her  as  she  saw  her  suspended  by 
a,  rope.  *'  Live,"  she  said,  '*  guilty  woman  ;  and,  that  you  may 
preserve  the  memory  of  this  lesson,  continue  to  hang,  both  you 
and  your  descendants,  to  all  future  times."  She  sprinkled  her 
with  the  juices  of  aconite,  and  immediately  her  hair  came  off, 
and  her  nose  and  ears  likewise.  Her  form  shrank  up,  and  her 
head  grew  smaller ;  her  fingers  cleaved  to  her  side,  and  served 
for  legs.  All  the  rest  of  her  is  body,  out  of  which  she  spins  her 
thread,  often  hanging  suspended  by  it,  in  the  same  attitude  as 
when  Minerva  touched  her  and  transformed  her  into  a  spider. 

Spenser  tells  the  story  of  Arachne  in  his  Muiopotmos,  adher- 
ing very  closely  to  his  master  Ovid,  but  improving  upon  him  in 
the  conclusion  of  the  story.  The  two  stanzas  which  follow  tell 
what  was  done  after  the  goddess  had  depicted  her  creation  of 
the  olive  tree  : — 

**  Amongst  these  leaves  she  made  a  Butterfly, 
With  excellent  device  and  wondrous  slight. 
Fluttering  among  the  olives  wantonly, 
That  seemed  to  live,  so  like  it  was  in  sight ; 
The  velvet  nap  which  on  his  wings  doth  lie. 
The  silken  down  with  which  his  back  is  dight. 
His  broad  outstretched  horns,  his  hairy  thighs, 
His  glorious  colors,  and  his  glistening  eyes." 

**  Which  when  Arachne  saw,  as  overlaid 
And  mastered  with  workmanship  so  rare. 
She  stood  astonied  long,  he  aught  gainsaid  ; 
And  with  fast-fixed  eyes  on  her  did  stare. 
And  by  her  silence,  sign  of  one  dismayed, 
The  victory  did  yield  her  as  her  share  ; 
Yet  did  she  inly  fret  and  felly  bum, 
And  all  her  blood  to  poisonous  rancor  turn." 

And  so  the  metamorphosis  is  caused  by  Arachne' s  own  mortifi- 
catior  and  vexation,  and  not  by  any  direct  act  of  the  goddess. 
The  following  specimen  of  old-fashioned  gallantry  is  by  Gar 
nek ; —

Ni'o-be. 

The  fate  of  Arachne  was  noised  abroad  through  all  the  coun- 
try, and  served  as  a  warning  to  all  presumptuous  mortals  not  to 
compare  themselves  with  the  divinities.  But  one,  and  she  a 
matron,  too,  failed  to  learn  the  lesson  of  humility.  It  was 
Ni'o-be,  the  queen  of  Thebes.  She  had  indeed  much  to  be 
proud  of;  but  it  was  not  her  husband's  fame,  nor  her  own  beauty, 
nor  their  great  descent,  nor  the  power  of  their  kingdom  that 
elated  her.  It  was  her  children ;  and  truly  the  happiest  of 
mothers  would  Niobe  have  been,  if  only  she  had  not  claimed  to 
be  so.  It  was  on  occasion  of  the  annual  celebration  in  honor 
of  Latona  and  her  offspring,  Apollo  and  Diana — when  the  peo- 
ple of  Thebes  were  assembled,  their  brows  crowned  with  laurel, 
bearing  frankincense  to  the  altars  and  paying  their  vows — that 
Niobe  appeared  among  the  crowd.  Her  attire  was  splendid  with 
gold  and  gems,  and  her  aspect  beautiful  as  the  face  of  an  angry 
woman  can  be.  She  stood  and  surveyed  the  people  with 
haughty  looks.  ^'What  folly,"  said  she,  "is  this! — to  prefer 
beings  whom  you  never  saw  to  those  who  stand  before  your  eyes ! 
Why  should  Latona  be  honored  with  worship,  and  none  be 
paid  to  me  ?  My  father  was  Tantalus,  who  was  received  as  a 
guest  at  the  table  of  the  gods  ;  my  mother  was  a  goddess.  My 
husband  built  and  rules  this  city,  Thebes ;  and  Phrygia  is  my 
paternal  inheritance.  Wherever  I  turn  my  eyes  I  survey  the 
elements  of  my  power ;  nor  is  my  form  and  presence  unworthy 
of  a  goddess.  To  all  this  let  me  add,  I  have  seven  sons  and 
seven  daughters,  and  look  for  sons-in-law  and  daughters-in-law 
of  pretentions  worthy  of  my  alliance.  Have  I  not  cause  for  pride  ? 
Will  you  prefer  to  me  this  Latona,  the  Titan's  daughter,  with

her  two  children  ?  I  have  seven  times  as  many.  Fortunate  in- 
deed am  I,  and  fortunate  I  shall  remain  1  Will  any  one  deny 
this  ?  My  abundance  is  my  security.  I  feel  myself  too  strong 
for  Fortune  to  subdue.  She  may  take  from  me  much ;  I  shaK 
still  have  much  left.  Were  I  to  lose  some  of  my  children,  1 
*=hould  hardly  be  left  as  poor  as  Latona  with  her  two  only.  Away 
with  you  from  these  solemnities — put  off  the  laurel  from  your 
brows  —  have  done 
with  this  worship  !" 
The  people  obeyed, 
and  left  the  sacred 
services  uncom- 
pleted. 

The  goddess  was 
indignant.  On  the 
Cynthian  mountain 
top,  where  she 
dwelt,  she  thus  ad- 
dressed her  son  and 
daughter:  *'My 
children,  I  who 
have  been  so  proud 
of  you  both,  and 
have  been  used  to 
hold  myself  second 
to  none  of  the  god- 
desses except  Juno 
alone,  begin  now  to 
doubt  whether  I  am 
indeed  a  goddess. 
I  shall  be  deprived 
of  my  worship  alto- 
gether unless  you 
protect  me. ' '  She  was  proceeding  in  this  strain,  but  Apollo  inter- 
rupted her.  *  *  Say  no  more, "  said  he ;  * '  speech  only  delays  pun 
ishment."  So  said  Diana  also.  Darting  through  the  air,  veiled 
in  clouds,  they  alighted  on  the  towers  of  the  city.  Spread  out 
before  the  gates  was  a  broad  plain,  where  the  youth  of  the  city

the  rest — some  mounted  on  spirited  horses  richly  caparisoned, 
some  driving  gay  chariots.  Ismenos,  the  first-born,  as  he  guided 
his  foaming  steeds,  struck  with  an  arrow  from  above  cried  out, 
**  Ah  me  !" — dropped  the  reins,  and  fell  lifeless.  Another,  hear- 
ing the  sound  of  the  bow — like  a  boatman  who  sees  the  storm 
gathering  and  makes  all  sail  for  the  port — gave  the  rein  to  his 
horses  and  attempted  to  escape.  The  inevitable  arrow  overtook 
him  as  he  fled.  Two  others,  younger  boys,  just  from  their  tasks, 
had  gone  to  the  playground  to  have  a  game  of  wrestling.  M 
they  stood  breast  to  breast,  one  arrow  pierced  them  both.  They 
uttered  a  cry  together,  together  cast  a  parting  look  around  them, 
and  together  breathed  their  last.  Alphenor,  an  elder  brother, 
seeing  them  fall,  hastened  to  the  spot  to  render  assistance,  and 
fell  stricken  in  the  act  of  brotherly  duty.  One  only  was  left, 
Ilioneus.  He  raised  his  arms  to  heaven,  to  try  whether  prayer 
might  not  avail.  *' Spare  me,  ye  godsT*  he  cried,  addressing 
all,  in  his  ignorance  that  all  needed  not  his  intercessions ;  and 
Apollo  would  have  spared  him,  but  the  arrow  had  already  leff 
the  string,  and  it  was  too  late. 

**  Phoebus  slew  the  sons 
"With  arrows  from  his  silver  bow,  incensed 
At  Niobe." — Homer  (Br}'ant's  tr. ). 

The  terror  of  the  people  and  grief  of  the  attendants  soon  made 
Miobe  acquainted  with  what  had  taken  place.  She  could  hardly 
think  it  possible;  she  was  indignant  that  the  gods  had  dared, 
and  amazed  that  they  had  been  able  to  do  it.  Her  husband, 
Amphion,  overwhelmed  with  the  blow,  destroyed  himself.  Alas  ! 
how  different  was  this  Niobe  from  her  who  had  so  lately  driven 
away  the  people  from  the  sacred  rites,  and  held  her  stately  course 
through  the  city,  the  envy  of  her  friends,  now  the  pity  even  of 
her  foes  !  She  knelt  over  the  lifeless  bodies,  and  kissed,  now 
one,  now  another  of  her  dead  sons.  Raising  her  pallid  arms  to 
heaven,  "Cruel  Latona,"  said  she,  "feed  full  your  rage  with 
my  anguish  !  Satiate  your  hard  heart,  while  I  follow  to  the 
grave  my  seven  sons.  Yet  where  is  your  triumph  ?  Bereaved 
as  I  am,  I  am  still  richer  than  you,  my  conqueror.'*  Scarce  had 
she  s;-oken  when  the  bow  sounded,  and  struck  terror  into  all 
beartL  except  Niobe' s  alone.     She  was  brave  from  excess  of

grief.  The  sisters  stood  in  garments  of  mourning  over  the  biers 
of  their  dead  brothers.  One  fell,  struck  by  an  arrow,  and  died 
on  the  corpse  she  was  bewailing.  Another,  attempting  to  con- 
sole her  mother,  suddenly  ceased  to  speak,  and  sank  lifeless  to 
the  earth.  A  third  tried  to  escape  by  flight,  a  fourth  by  con- 
cealment ;  another  stood  trembling,   uncertain   what  course  to 

take. 

**  But  what  is  this?     WTiat  means  this  oozing  flood? 
Her  daughters,  too,  are  weltering  in  their  blood  : 
One  clasps  her  mother's  knees,  one  clings  around 
Her  neck,  and  one  lies  prostrate  on  the  ground ; 
One  seeks  her  breast ;  one  eyes  the  coming  woe 
And  shudders  ;  one  in  terror  crouches  low." — Meleager. 

Six  were  now  dead,  and  only  one  remained,  whom  the  mother 
held  clasped  in  her  arms,  and  covered  as  it  were  with  her  whole 
body,  *'  Spare  me  one,  and  that  the  youngest !  O,  spare  me 
one  of  so  many  !"  she  cried;  and  while  she  spoke,  that  one  fell 
dead.  Desolate  she  sat,  among  sons,  daughters,  husband,  all 
dead,  and  seemed  torpid  with  grief.  The  breeze  moved  not  her 
hair,  no  color  was  on  her  cheek,  her  eyes  glared  fixed  and  im- 
movable, there  was  no  sign  of  life  about  her.  Her  very  tongue 
cleaved  to  the  roof  of  her  mouth,  and  her  veins  ceased  to  convey 
the  tide  of  life.  Her  neck  bent  not,  her  arms  made  no  gesture, 
her  foot  no  step.  She  was  changed  to  stone,  within  and  with- 
out. Yet  tears  continued  to  flow ;  and,  borne  on  a  whirlwind 
to  her  native  mountain,  she  still  remains,  a  mass  of  rock,  from 
which  a  trickling  stream  flows,  the  tribute  of  her  never-ending 
grief. 

The  story  of  Niobe  has  furnished  Byron  with  a  fine  illustration 
of  the  fallen  condition  of  modern  Rome  : — 

**  The  Niobe  of  nations  !  there  she  stands, 
Childless  and  crownless  in  her  voiceless  woe  ; 
An  empty  urn  within  her  withered  hands, 
Whose  holy  dust  was  scattered  long  ago  ; 
The  Scipios'  tomb  contains  no  ashes  now  : 
The  very  sepulchres  lie  tenantless 
Of  their  heroic  dwellers  ;  dost  thou  flow, 
Old  Tiber  !  through  a  marble  wilderness  ? 

Rise  with  thy  yellow  waves,  and  mantle  her  distress." 

—Childe  Harold^  IV.  79.

Tragic  as  is  the  story  of  Niobe,  we  cannot  forbear  to  smile  at 
ihe  use  Moore  has  made  of  it  in  **  Rhymes  on  the  Road  "  : — 

"'Twas  in  his  carriage  the  sublime 
Sir  Richard  Blackmore  used  to  rhyme, 

And,  if  the  wits  don' t  do  him  wrong, 
*Twixt  death  and  epics  passed  his  time,

Sir  Richard  Blackmore  was  a  physician,  and  at  the  same  time 
a  very  prolific  and  very  tasteless  poet,  whose  works  are  now  for- 
gotten, unless  when  recalled  to  mind  by  some  wit  like  Moore 
for  the  sake  of  a  pleasantry.

The  Wedding-Feast. 

The  Grse'se  and  Gor'gons, 

The  Grse'  se  were  three  sisters  who  were  gray -haired  from  their 
birth,  whence  their  name — sisters,  and  at  the  same  time  guardians 
of  the  Gorgons.  Their  names,  Deino,  Pephredo,  and  Enyo, 
mean,  respectively,  ** alarm,"  "dread "and  "horror."  They 
were  conceived  as  misshapen,  hideous  creatures,  hoary  and 
withered  from  their  birth,  with  only  one  eye  and  one  tooth  for 
the  common  use  of  the  three,  and  were  supposed  to  inhabit  a 
dark  cavern  near  the  entrance  to  Tartarus. 

The  Gor'gons  were  monstrous  females  with  huge  teeth  like 
those  of  swine,  brazen  claws,  and  snaky  hair.  None  of  these  be- 
ings make  much  figure  in  mythology  except  Medusa,  the  Gorgon, 
whose  story  we  shall  next  advert  to.  We  mention  them  chiefly 
to  introduce  an  ingenious  theory  of  some  modem  writers,  namely, 
that  the  Gorgons  and  Graeae  were  only  personifications  of  th^ 
terrors  of  the  sea,  the  former  denoting  the  strong  billows  of  the

against  the  rocks  of  the  coast.  Their  names,  in  Greek,  signify 
the  above  epithets. 

A-cris'i-us — Per'seus  and  Me-du'sa. 

A-crls'i-us  was  the  king  of  Argos ;  his  only  child,  Danac^ 
was  a  beautiful  maiden,  of  whom  he  was  very  fond.  It  had  beer? 
revealed  to  him  by  an  oracle  that  his  daughter's  son  would  yet  be 
the  instrument  of  his  death.  Acrisius  determined,  therefore^ 
that  his  daughter  should  never  marry,  so  he  imprisoned  her  in  a 
tower  of  brass.  Jupiter  looked  down  from  Olympus,  and  fell  in 
love  with  the  royal  captive.  In  order  to  escape  the  notice  of 
the  guards  he  transformed  himself  into  a  shower  of  gold. 

"Danae,  in  a  brazen  tower 
Where  no  love  was,  loved  a  shower." — Shelley. 

A  secret  marriage  was  the  result,  and  Per'seus  was  born. 
Acrisius,  still  fearing  the  oracle's  warning,  caused  the  mothei 
and  child  to  be  shut  up  in  a  chest  and  set  adrift  on  the  sea. 

**When  round  the  well-fram'd  ark  the  blowing  blast 
Roar'd,  and  the  heaving  whirlpools  of  the  deep 
With  rough' ning  surge  seem'd  threatening  to  o'ertum 
The  wide-tost  vessel,  not  with  tearless  cheeks 
The  mother  round  her  infant  gently  twined 
Her  tender  arm,  and  cried,  *  Ah  me  !  my  child  ! 
What  sufferings  I  endure!  thou  sleep' st  the  while, 
Inhaling  in  thy  milky-breathing  brea-t 
The  balm  of  slumber.*  "— Simonides  (Elton's  tr.). 

The  chest  floated  towards  Seriphus,  where  it  was  found  by  a 
fisherman,  who  conveyed  the  mother  and  infant  to  Polydectes, 
king  of  the  country,  by  whom  they  were  treated  with  kindness. 

Here  Perseus  remained  and  grew  to  manhood.  Polydectes, 
the  king,  in  the  meanwhile  had  fallen  in  love  with  his  mother, 
Danae,  and  wished  her  to  become  his  wife.  She  refused,  and  ap- 
pealed to  her  son  for  protection.  The  king,  hoping  for  a  more 
favorable  response  to  his  suit  in  the  absence  of  Perseus,  sent  him 
to  attempt  the  conquest  of  Medusa,  a  terrible  monster  who  had 
laid  waste  the  country.  She  was  once  a  beautiful  maiden  whose 
hair  was  her  chief  glory,  but  as  she  dared  to  vie  in  beauty  with

Minerva,  the  goddess  deprived  her  of  her  charms  and  changed 
her  beautiful  ringlets  into  hissing  serpents.  She  became  a  cruel 
monster  of  so  frightful  an  aspect  that  no  living  thing  could  be-

been  petrified  with  the  sight. 


Perseus,  by  Canova  (Vatican,  Rome). 

•"What  was  that  snaky-headed  Gorgon -shield 
That  wise  Minerva  wore,  unconquered  virgin, 
Wherewith  she  freezed  her  foes  to  congealed  stone, 
But  rigid  looks  of  chaste  austerity.

Pluto  lent  him  his  helmet,  by  which  he  became  invisible  at  will  | 
Mercury  his  winged  shoes,  and  Minerva  her  shield. 

•*  Minerva  thus  to  Perseus  lent  her  shield  ; 
Secure  of  conquest,  sent  him  to  the  field  : 
The  hero  acted  what  the  queen  ordain' d, 
So  was  his  fame  complete."  —  Prior. 

The  young  adventurer,  rendering  himself  invisible  by  means 
of  Pluto's  shield,  first  visited  the  cavern  of  the  Graeae.  Their 
single  eye  was  on  its  way  from  one  sister  to  another.  This  he 
intercepted,  and  promised  to  return  it  only  upon  the  condition 
that  they  should  direct  him  to  Medusa.  Not  wishing  to  live  in 
perpetual  darkness,  they  consented.  The  Gorgon  and  her  two 
jjisters  lived  in  a  desolate  cave  by  the  sea. 

**  But  a  third  woman  paced  about  the  hall. 
And  ever  turned  her  head  from  wall  to  wall. 
And  moaned  aloud  and  shrieked  in  her  despair. 
Because  the  golden  tresses  of  her  hair 
Were  moved  by  writhing  snakes  from  side  to  side. 
That  in  their  writhing  oftentimes  would  glide 
On  to  her  breast  or  shuddering  shoulders  white  ; 
Or,  falling  down,  the  hideous  things  would  light 
Upon  her  feet,  and,  crawling  thence,  would  twine 
Their  slimy  folds  about  her  ankles  fine." — William  MORRIS, 

Perseus  waited  until  Medusa  had  fallen  asleep.  He  took  great 
^are  not  to  look  directly  at  her,  but,  guided  by  her  image,  reflectea 
in  the  bright  shield  which  he  bore,  he  cut  off  her  head  and  gave 
it  to  Minerva,  who  fixed  it  in  the  middle  of  her  ^gis.* 

Per'seus   and  At'las. 

After  the  slaughter  of  Medusa,  Per'seus,  bearing  with  him  the 
head  of  the  Gorgon,  flew  far  and  wide,  over  land  and  sea.  As 
night  came  on  he  reached  the  western  limit  of  the  earth,  where 
the  sun  goes  down.  Here  he  would  gladly  have  rested  till 
morning.  It  was  the  realm  of  King  At'las,  whose  bulk  sur- 
passed that  of  all  other  men.     He  was  rich  in  flocks  and  herds, 

^  There  is  a  legend  that  when  Perseus  flew  over  the  African  desert  with  Me- 
dusa's head,  a  few  drops  of  blood  fell  upon  the  sand,  from  which  came  all  th4 
poisonous  reptiles  that  infest  the  country.

and  had  no  neighbor  or  rival  to  dispute  his  state.  But  his  chief 
pride  was  in  his  gardens,  whose  fruit  was  of  gold,  hanging  from 
golden  branches,  half  hid  with  golden  leaves.  Perseus  said  to 
him,  *'I  come  as  a  guest.  If  you  honor  illustrious  descent,  I 
claim  Jupiter  for  my  father;  if  mighty  deeds,  I  plead  the  con- 
quest of  the  Gorgon.  I  seek  rest 
and  food."  But  Atlas  remem- 
bered that  an  ancient  prophecy 
had  warned  him  that  a  son  of 
Jove  should  one  day  rob  him  of 
his  golden  apples.*  So  he  an- 
swered, *  *  Begone  !  for  neither 
your  false  claims  of  glory  nor 
parentage  shall  protect  you;" 
and  he  attempted  to  thrust  him 
out.  Perseus,  finding  the  giant 
too  strong  for  him,  said,  "  Since 
you  value  my  friendship  so  little, 
deign  to  accept  a  present;" 
and  turning  his  face  away,  he 
held  up  the  Gorgon's  head. 
Atlas,  with  all  his  bulk,  was 
changed  into  stone.  His  beard 
and  hair  became  forests,  his 
arms  and  shoulders  cliffs,  his 
head  a  summit,  and  his  bones 
rocks.  Each  part  increased  in 
bulk  till  he  became  a  mountain, 
and  (such  was  the  pleasure  of 
the  gods)  heaven,  with  all  its 
stars,  rests  upon  his  shoulders.

^ey  sent  a  prodigious  sea-monster  to  ravage  the  coast.  To  ap- 
pease the  deities,  Cepheus  was  directed  by  the  oracle  to  expose 
his  daughter  An-drom'e-da  to  be  devoured  by  the  monster.  As 
Perseus  looked  down  from  his  aerial  height  he  beheld  the  virgin 
chained  to  a  rock,  and  waiting  the  approach  of  the  serpent.  She 
was  so  pale  and  motionless  that  if  it  had  not  been  for  her  flow- 
ing tears,  and  her  hair  that  moved  in  the  breeze,  he  would  have 
taken  her  for  a  marble  statue.  He  was  so  startled  at  the  sight 
that  he  almost  forgot  to  wave  his  wings.  As  he  hovered  over 
her  he  said,  **  O,  virgin,  undeserving  of  those  chains,  but  rather 
of  such  as  bind  fond  lovers  together,  tell  me,  I  beseech  you,  your 
name  and  the  name  of  your  country,  and  why  you  are  thus 
bound. ' '  At  first  she  was  silent  from  modesty,  and,  if  she  could, 
would  have  hid  her  face  with  her  hands ;  but  when  he  repeated 
his  questions,  for  fear  she  might  be  thought  guilty  of  some  fault 
which  she  dared  not  tell,  she  disclosed  her  name  and  that  of  her 
country,  and  her  mother's  pride  of  beauty.  Before  she  had  done 
speaking  a  sound  was  heard  off  upon  the  water,  and  the  sea- 
monster  appeared,  with  his  head  raised  above  the  surface,  cleav- 
ing the  waves  with  his  broad  breast.  The  virgin  shrieked.  The 
father  and  mother,  who  had  now  arrived  at  the  scene,  wretched 
both,  but  the  mother  more  justly  so,  stood  by,  not  able  to  afford 
protection,  but  only  to  pour  forth  lamentations  and  to  embrace 
the  victim.  Then  spoke  Perseus  :  **  There  will  be  time  enough 
for  tears  ;  this  hour  is  all  we  have  for  rescue.  My  rank  as  the 
son  of  Jove  and  my  renown  as  the  slayer  of  the  Gorgon  might 
make  me  acceptable  as  a  suitor ;  but  I  will  try  to  win  her  by 
services  rendered,  if  the  gods  will  only  be  propitious.  If  she  be 
rescued  by  my  valor,  I  demand  that  she  be  my  reward."  The 
parents  consent  (how  could  they  hesitate?),  and  promise  a  royal 
dowry  with  her. 

And  now  the  monster  was  within  the  range  of  a  stone  thrown 
by  a  skilful  slinger,  when  with  a  sudden  bound  the  youth  soared 
into  the  air.  As  an  eagle,  when,  from  his  lofty  flight,  he  sees  a 
serpent  basking  in  the  sun,  pounces  upon  him  and  seizes  him  by 
the  neck  to  prevent  him  from  turning  his  head  round  and  using 
his  fangs,  so  the  youth  darted  down  upon  the  back  of  the  mon- 
ster and  plunged  his  sword  into  its  shoulder.  Irritated  by  the 
wound  the  monster  raised  himself  into  the  air,  then  plunged  into

the  depth ;  then,  like  a  wild  boar  surrounded  by  a  pack  of  bark 
ing  dogs,  turned  swiftly  from  side  to  side,  while  the  youth  eluded 
its  attacks  by  means  of  his  wings.  Wherever  he  can  find  a  pas- 
sage for  his  sword  between  the  scales  he  makes  a  wound,  piercing 
now  the  side,  now  the  flank,  as  it  slopes  towards  the  tail.  The 
brute  spouts  from  his  nostrils  water  mixed  with  blood.  The 
wings  of  the  hero  are  wet  with  it,  and  he  dares  no  longer  trust 
to  them.  Alighting  on  a  rock  v/hich  rose  above  the  waves,  and 
holding  on  by  a  projecting  fragment,  as  the  monster  floated  near 
he  gave  him  a  death  stroke.  The  people  who  had  gathered  on 
the  shore  shouted  so  that  the  hills  reechoed  the  sound. 

**  On  the  hills  a  shout 
Of  joy,  and  on  the  rocks  the  ring  of  mail ; 
And  while  the  hungry  serpent's  gloating  eyes 
Were  fixed  on  me,  a  knight  in  casque  of  gold 
And  blazing  shield,  who  with  his  flashing  blade 
Fell  on  the  monster.     Long  the  conflict  raged. 
Till  all  the  rocks  were  red  with  blood  and  slime. 
And  yet  my  champion  from  those  horrible  jaws 
And  dreadful  coils  was  scathless." — Lewis  Morris. 

The  parents,  transported  with  joy,  embraced  their  future  son- 
in-law,  calling  him  their  deliverer  and  the  savior  of  their  house: 
and  the  virgin,  both  cause  and  reward  of  the  contest,  descended 
from  the  rock. 

Cas-si-o-pe'ia. 

Cas-si-o-pe'ia  was  an  Ethiopian,  and  consequently,  in  spite 
of  her  boasted  beauty,  black  ;  at  least  so  Milton  seems  to  have 
thought,  who  alludes  to  this  story  in  his  **  Penseroso,*'  where  he 
addresses  Melancholy  as  the

OASSIOPELA,  149 

Cassiop>eia  is  called  *'  the  starred  ^thiop  queen  *'  because  after 
her  death  she  was  placed  among  the  stars,  forming  the  constella- 
tion of  that  name.  Though  she  attained  this  honor,  yet  the  Sea- 
Nymphs,  her  old  enemies,  prevailed  so  far  as  to  cause  her  to  be 
placed  in  that  part  of  the  heavens  near  the  pole,  where  every 
night  she  is  half  the  time  held  with  her  head  downward,  to  give 
her  a  lesson  of  humility. 

Memnon  was  an  Ethiopian  prince,  of  whom  we  shall  tell  in 
a  future  chapter. 

The  Wedding-Feast. 

The  joyful  parents,  with  Perseus  and  Andromeda,  repaired  to 
the  palace,  where  a  banquet  was  spread  for  them,  and  all  was 
joy  and  festivity.  But  suddenly  a  noise  was  heard  of  warlike* 
clamor,  and  Phineus,  the  betrothed  of  the  virgin,  with  a  party 
of  his  adherents,  burst  in,  demanding  the  maiden  as  his  own. 
It  was  in  vain  that  Chepheus  remonstrated, — **  You  should  have 
claimed  her  when  she  lay  bound  to  the  rock,  the  monster's  vic- 
tim. The  sentence  of  the  gods  dooming  her  to  such  a  fate  dis- 
solved all  engagements,  as  death  itself  would  have  done." 
Phineus  made  no  rqply,  but  hurled  his  javelin  at  Perseus,  but  it 
missed  its  mark  and  fell  harmless.  Perseus  would  have  thrown 
his  in  turn,  but  the  cowardly  assailant  ran  and  took  shelter  be- 
hind the  altar.  But  his  act  was  a  signal  for  an  onset  by  his  band 
upon  the  guests  of  Cepheus.  They  defended  themselves,  and  a 
general  conflict  ensued,  the  old  king  retreating  from  the  scene 
after  fruitless  expostulations,  calling  the  gods  tc  witness  that  he 
was  guiltless  of  this  outrage  on  the  rights  of  hospitality. 

Perseus  and  his  friends  maintained  for  some  time  the  unequal 
contest ;  but  the  numbers  of  the  assailants  were  too  great  for  them^ 
and  destruction  seemed  inevitable,  when  a  sudden  thought  struck 
Perseus, — **I  will  make  my  enemy  defend  me.*'  Then  with  a 
loud  voice  he  exclaimed,  **If  I  have  any  friend  here  let  him 
turn  away  his  eyes  !**  and  held  aloft  the  Gorgon's  head.  "  Seek 
not  to  frighten  us  with  your  jugglery,**  said  Thescelus,  and  raised 
his  javelin  in  act  to  throw,  and  became  stone  in  the  very  atti- 
tude. Ampyx  was  about  to  plunge  his  sword  into  the  body  of  a 
prostrate  foe,  but  his  arm  stiffened  and  he  could  neither  thrust 
forwird  nor  withdraw  it.     Another,  in  the  midst  of  a  vociferoia?

challenge,  stopped,  his  mouth  open,  but  no  sound  issuing.  One 
of  Perseus' s  friends,  Aconteus,  caught  sight  of  the  Gorgon  and 
stiffened  like  the  rest.  Astyages  struck  him  with  his  sword,  but 
instead  of  wounding,  it  recoiled  with  a  ringing  noise. 

Phineus  beheld  this  dreadful  result  of  his  unjust  aggression, 
and  felt  confounded.  He  called  aloud  to  his  friends,  but  got  no 
answer ;  he  touched  them  and  found  them  stone.  Falling  on 
his  knees  and  stretching  out  his  hands  to  Perseus,  but  turning  his 
head  away,  he  begged  for  mercy.  ^*Take  all,"  said  he,  **give 
me  but  my  life.'*  **  Base  coward  !"  said  Perseus,  "  thus  much 
I  will  grant  you :  no  weapon  shall  touch  you ;  moreover,  you 
shall  be  preserved  in  my  house  as  a  memorial  of  these  events." 
So  saying,  he  held  the  Gorgon's  head  to  the  side  where  Phineus 
was  looking,  and  in  the  very  form  in  which  he  knelt,  with  his 
hands  outstretched  and  face  averted,  he  became  fixed  immovably,

«*  As  'mid  the  fabled  Libyan  bridal  stood 
Perseus  in  stern  tranquillity  of  wrath, 
Half  stood,  half  floated  on  his  ankle-plvunes 
Out- swelling,  while  the  bright  face  on  his  shield 
Looked  into  stone  the  raging  fray  ;  so  rose, 
But  with  no  magic  arms,  wearing  alone 
Th'  appalling  and  control  of  his  firm  look.

Perseus,  with  his  bride,  returned  to  Seriphus.  There  he 
Avenged  the  king's  ill  treatment  of  his  mother  by  showing  him 
the  fatal  head  and  changing  him  into  a  stone. 

He  also  returned  to  Argos,  and  learned  that  his  grandfather, 
Acrisius,  had  been  driven  from  his  throne  and  was  a  prisoner  of 
state.  Perseus  slew  the  usurper,  and  restored  the  old  king  to 
his  rightful  place.  The  prediction  of  the  oracle  was  slow  of  ful-

quoits  with  his  friends.  Acrisius,  standing  by,  was  accidentally 
struck  by  a  discus,  and  killed.  Perseus  became  king,  and  ruled 
with  great  wisdom.  At  his  death  he,  with  Andromeda,  joined 
ihe  immortals  among  the  stars  in  the  constellation  of  Cassiopeia,

CHAPTER  XVI. 
Monsters. 


Giants,  Sphinx,  CEd'i-pus,  Peg'a  sus  arid  Chi-mae'ra, 
Cen'taurs,  Griffin,  and  Pyg'mies. 

Monsters,  in  the  language  of  mythology,  were  beings  of  un- 
natural proportions  or  parts,  usually  regarded  with  terror,  as  pos- 
sessing immense  strength  and  ferocity,  which  they  employed  foi 
the  injury  and  annoyance  of  men.  Some  of  them  were  supposed  to 
combine  the  members  of  different  animals  ;  such  were  the  Sphinx 
and  Chimsera;  and  to  these  all  the  terrible  qualities  of  wild 
beasts  were  attributed,  together  with  human  sagacity  and  facul- 
ties. Others,  as  the  giants,  differed  from  men  chiefly  in  their 
size ;  and  in  this  particular  we  must  recognize  a  wide  distinction 
among  them.  The  human  giants,  if  so  they  may  be  called,  such 
as  the  Cyclopes,  Antaeus,  Orion  and  others,  must  be  supposed 
not  to  be  altogether  disproportioned  to  human  beings,  for  they 
mingled  in  love  and  strife  with  them.  But  the  superhuman 
giants,  who  warred  with  the  gods,  were  of  vastly  larger  dimen- 
sions. Tityus,  we  are  told,  when  stretched  on  the  plain,  covered 
nine  acres,  and  Enceladus  required  the  whole  of  Mount  ^tna  to 
be  laid  upon  him  to  keep  him  down,

"  And  the  nations  far  away 
'  Are  watching  with  eager  eyes. 

They  talk  together,  and  say 

To-morrow,  perhaps  to-day, 
Enceladus  will  arise." — Longfellow  {^Enceladus), 

We  have  already  spoken  of  the  war  which  the  giants  waged 
against  the  gods,  and  of  its  results.  While  this  war  lasted  the 
giants  proved  a  formidable  enemy.  Some  of  them,  like  Bria- 
reus,  had  a  hundred  arms;  others,  like  Typhon,  breathed  out 
fire.  At  one  time  they  put  the  gods  to  such  fear  that  they  fled 
into  Egypt,  and  hid  themselves  under  various  forms.  Jupiter 
took  the  form  of  a  ram,  whence  he  was  afterwards  worshipped  in 
Egypt  as  the  god  Ammon,  with  curved  horns.  Apollo  be- 
came a  crow,  Bacchus  a  goat,  Diana  a  cat,  Juno  a  cow,  Venus  a 
fish,  Mercury  a  bird.  At  another  time  the  giants  attempted  to 
climb  up  into  heaven,  and  for  that  purpose  took  up  the  moun- 
tain Ossa  and  piled  it  on  Pelion.*  They  were  at  last  subdued  by 
thunderbolts,  which  Minerva  invented,  and  taught  Vulcan  and 
his  Cyclopes  to  make  for  Jupiter. 

The  Sphinx— CEd'i-pus. 

Laius,  king  of  Thebes,  was  warned  by  an  oracle  that  there  was 
danger  to  his  throne  and  life  if  his  new-born  son  should  be  suf- 
feied  to  grow  up. 

**  Laius  once, 
Not  from  Apollo,  but  his  priests,  receiv'd 
An  oracle,  which  said,  it  was  decreed 
He  should  be  slain  by  his  own  son." 

— Sophocles  (Francklin's  tr.). 

He  therefore  committed  the  child  to  the  care  of  a  herdsman, 
with  orders  to  destroy  him  ;  but  the  herdsman,  moved  with  pity, 
yet  not  daring  entirely  to  disobey,  tied  up  the  child  by  the  feet, 
and  left  him  hanging  to  the  branch  of  a  tree.  In  this  condition 
the  infant  was  found  by  a  peasant,  who  carried  him  to  his  master 
and  mistress,  by  whom  he  was  adopted  and  called  CEd'i-pus,  or 
Swollen-foot. 

Many  years  afterwards  Laius  being  on  his  way  to  Delphi,  ac- 
companied only  by  one  attendant,  met  in  a  narrow  road  a  young

at  their  command,  the  attendant  killed  one  of  his  horses,  and 
^the  stranger,  filled  with  rage,  slew  both  Laius  and  his  attend;i.nt, 

"  Beneath  my  staff 
At  once  he  sunk,  and  from  his  chariot  rolled. 
I  slew  them  all." — Sophocles  (Potter). 

The  young  man  was  CEdipus,  who  thus  unknowingly  became 
the  slayer  of  his  own  father.

Shortly  after  this  event,  the  city  of  Thebes  was  afflicted  with 
a  monster  which  infested  the  high-road.  It  was  called  th« 
Sphinx.  It  had  the  body  of  a  lion,  and  the  upper  part  of  d 
woman.  It  lay  crouched  on  the  top  of  a  rock,  and  arrested  all 
travellers  who  came  that  way,  proposing  to  them  a  riddle,  with 
the  condition  that  those  who  could  solve  it  should  pass  safe,  but 
those  who  failed  should  be  killed.  Not  one  had  yet  succeeded 
in  solving  it,  and  all  had  been  slain.  (Edipus  was  not  daunted 
by  these  alarming  accounts,  but  boldly  advanced  to  the  triaL 
The  Sphinx  said:  — 

*•  Tell  me,  what  animal  is  that 

Which  has  four  feet  at  morning  bright, 

Has  two  at  noon,  and  three  at  night  ?" — PrIOR. 

QEdipus  replied,  ''Man,  who  in  childhood  creeps  on  hands 
and  knees,  in  manhood  walks  erect,  and  in  old  age  with  the  aid 
of  a  staff. ' '  The  Sphinx  was  so  mortified  at  the  solving  of  her 
riddle  that  she  cast  herself  down  from  the  rock  and  perished. 

The  gratitude  of  the  people  for  their  deliverance  was  so  great 
that  they  made  CEdipus  their  king,  giving  him  in  marriage  their 
queen  Jocasta.  CEdipus,  ignorant  of  his  parentage,  had  already 
become  the  slayer  of  his  father ;  in  marrying  the  queen  he  be- 
came the  husband  of  his  mother. 

G^.Dirus  :  "  But  tell  me  what  the  form 

Of  Laius,  what  his  stature  and  his  age  ? 

Jocasta  :  ••  Tall  and  of  manly  port,  his  locks  just  tinged 

With  grey  ;  his  form  much  like  to  thine." — Sophocles  (Potter). 

These  horrors  remained  undiscovered,  till  at  length  Thebes 
was  afflicted  with  famine  and  pestilence,  and  the  oracle  bemg 
consulted,  the  double  crim_e  of  CEdipus  came  to  light. 

**  The  plague,  he  said,  should  cease, 
When  those  who  murder' d  Laius  were  discover' d. 
And  paid  the  forfeit  ot  their  crime  by  death 
Or  banishment." — SoPHOCLES  (Francklin's  tr. ). 

Jocasta  put  an  end  to  her  own  life,  and  CEdipus,  seized  witb 
madness,  tore  out  his  eyes. 

•'  They,  in  the  dark,  should  look  in  time  to  come 
On  those  whom  they  ought  never  to  have  seen, 
Nor  know  the  dear  ones  whom  he  fain  had  known."

He  then  wandered  away  from  Thebes,  dreaded  and  abandoned 
by  all  except  his  daughters, 

"  Ye  tender  props  of  my  old  age." 

These  faithfully  adhered  to  him,  till,  after  a  tedious  period  of 
miserable  wandering,  he  found  the  termination  of  his  wretched 
life. 

**  Behold  me,  now  how  fallen, 

How  sunk  beneath  a  flood  of  dreadful  woes  I 

See  this,  and,  mortal  as  thou  art,  survey 

Man' s  last  deciding  day,  and  none  pronounce 

Happy  the  bounds  of  life  till  he  hath  passed  * 

Safe  and  uninjured  by  the  storms  of  state." 

—Sophocles  (Potter). 

Peg'a-sus  and  the  Chi-mse'ra. 

When  Perseus  cut  off  Medusa's  head,  the  blood  sinking  into 
the  earth  produced  the  winged  horse  Peg'a-sus.  Minerva  caught 
and  tamed  him,  and  presented  him  to  the  Muses.  The  fountain 
Hippocrene,  on  the  Muses'  mountain  Helicon,  was  opened  by  a 
kick  from  his  hoof. 

The  Chi-mae'ra  was  a  fearful  monster,  breathing  fire.  The 
fore  part  of  its  body  was  a  compound  of  the  lion  and  the  goat, 
and  the  hind  part  a  dragon's. 

**  Dire  Chimera's  conquest  was  enjoin'd  ; 
A  mingled  monster,  of  no  mortal  kind  ; 

Behind,  a  dragon's  fiery  tail  was  spread  ; 

A  goat's  rough  body  bore  a  lion's  head ; 

Her  pitchy  nostrils  flaky  flames  expire  ; 

Her  gaping  throat  emits  infernal  fire." 

— Homer  (Pope's  tr.). 

It  made  great  havoc  in  Lycia,  so  that  the  king  lobates  sought 
for  some  hero  to  destroy  it.  At  that  time  there  arrived  at  his 
court  a  gallant  young  warrior,  whose  name  was  Bellerophon. 
He  brought  letters  from  Prcetus,  the  son-in-law  of  lobates,  rec- 
ommending Bellerophon  in  the  warmest  terms  as  an  unconquera- 
ble hero,  but  added  at  the  close  a  request  to  his  father-in-law  to 
put  him  to  death.  The  reason  was  that  Prcetus  was  jealous  of 
him,  suspecting  that  his  wife  Antea  looked  with  too  much  admi'

lobates,  on  perusing  the  letters,  was  puzzled  what  to  do,  not 
willing  to  violate  the  claims  of  hospitality,  yet  wishing  to  oblige 
his  son-in-law.  A  lucky  thought  occurred  to  him  to  sencf  Bel- 
icrophon  to  combat  with  the  Chimaera.  Bellerophon  accepted 
the  proposal,  but  before  proceeding  to  the  combat  consulted  the 
soothsayer  Polyidus,  who  advised  him  to  procure  if  possible  the

horse  Pegasus  for  the  conflict.  For  this  purpose  he  directed  him 
to  pass  the  night  in  the  temple  of  Minerva.  He  did  so,  and  as^ 
he  slept  Minerva  came  to  him  and  gave  him  a  golden  bridle. 
When  he  awoke  the  bridle  remained  in  his  hand.  Minerva  also 
showed  him  Pegasus  drinking  at  the  well  of  Pirene,  and  at  sight 
of  the  bridle  the  winged  steed  came  willingly  and  suffered  himself. 
to  be  taken.  Bellerophon  mounted  him,  rose  with  him  into  the 
air,  soon  found  the  Chimaera,  and  gained  an  easy  victory  ovei 
the  monster. 

After  the  conquest  of  the  Chimaera,  Bellerophon  was  expos*».d

to  further  trials  and  labors  by  his  unfriendly  host,  but  by  the  aid 
of  Pegasus  he  triumphed  in  them  all ;  till  at  length  lobates,  see- 
ing that  the  hero  was  a  special  favorite  of  the  gods,  gave  him  his 
daughter  in  marriage  and  made  him  his  successor  on  the  throne. 
At  last  Bellerophon,  by  his  pride  and  presumption,  drew  upon 
himself  the  anger  of  the  gods  ;  it  is  said  he  even  attempted  to  fly 
up  into  heaven  on  his  winged  steed ;  but  Jupiter  sent  a  gadfly 
which  stung  Pegasus  and  made  him  throw  his  rider,  who  became 
lame  and  blind  in  consequence. 

**  Bold  Bellerophon  (so  Jove  decreed 
In  wrath)  fell  headlong  from  the  fields  of  air." — WoRDSWORTH. 

After  this,  Bellerophon  wandered  lonely  through  the  Aleian 
field,  avoiding  the  paths  of  men,  and  died  miserably. 

Milton  alludes  to  Bellerophon  in  the  beginning  of  the  seventh 
book  of  **  Paradise  Lost": — 

**  Descend  from  Heaven,  Urania,  by  that  name 
If  rightly  thou  art  called,  whose  voice  divine 
Following,  above  the  Olympian  hill  I  soar, 
Above  the  flight  of  Pegasean  wing  ! 
Up  led  by  thee. 
Lest,  from  this  flying  steed  unreined  (as  once 
Bellerophon,  though  from  a  lower  sphere) 
Dismounted,  on  the  Aleian  field  I  fall, 
Erroneous  there  to  wander  and  forlorn.** 

Young  in  his  *' Night  Thoughts,"  speaking  of  the  sceptic, 

says : — 

**  He  whose  blind  thought  futurity  denies. 
Unconscious  bears,  Bellerophon,  like  thee 
His  own  indictment ;  he  condemns  himself. 
Who  reads  his  bosom  reads  immortal  life, 
Or  nature  there,  imposing  on  her  sons.

Pegasus,  being  the  horse  of  the  Muses,  has  always  been  at  the 
service  of  the  poets.  Schiller  tells  a  pretty  story  of  his  having 
been  sold  by  a  needy  poet,  and  put  to  the  cart  and  the  plough. 
He  was  not  fit  for  such  service,  and  his  clownish  master  could

Cen'taurs. 

These  monsters  were  represented  as  men  from  the  head  to  the 
loins,  while  the  remainder  of  the  body  was  that  of  a  horse.  The 
ancients  were  too  fond  of  a  horse  to  consider  the  union  of  his 
nature  with  man's  as  forming  a  very  degraded  compound,  and 
accordingly  the  Cen'taur  is  the  only  one  of  the  fancied  mon- 
sters of  antiquity  to  which  any  good  traits  are  assigned.  The 
Centaurs  were  admitted  to  the  companionship  of  man,  and  at  the 
marriage  of  Pirithous  with  Hippodamia,  they  were  among  the 
guests.  At  the  feast,  Eurytion,  one  of  the  Centaurs,  becoming 
intoxicated  with  the  wine,  attempted  to  offer  violence  to  the 
bride  ;  the  other  Centaurs  followed  his  example,  and  a  dreadful 
conflict  arose,  in  which  several  of  them  were  slain.  This  is  the 
celebrated  battle  of  the  Lapithae  and  Centaurs,  a  favorite  subject 
with  the  sculptors  and  poets  of  antiquity. 

But  not  all  the  Centaurs  were  like  the  rude  guests  of  Piri' 
thous.  Chiron  was  instructed  by  Apollo  and  Diana,  and  was 
renowned  for  his  skill  in  hunting,  medicine,  music,  and  the  art 
of  prophecy.  The  most  distinguished  heroes  of  Grecian  story 
were  his  pupils.  Among  the  rest  the  infant  ^sculapius  was  in- 
trusted to  his  charge  by  Apollo,  his  father.  When  the  sage  re- 
turned to  his  home  bearing  the  infant,  his  daughter  Ocyroe  came 
forth  to  meet  him,  and  at  sight  of  the  child  burst  forth  into  a 
prophetic  strain  (for  she  was  a  prophetess),  foretelling  the  glory 
that  he  was  to  achieve,  ^.sculapius  when  grown  up  became  a 
renowned  physician,  and  even  in  one  instance  succeeded  in  re- 
storing the  dead  to  life.  Pluto  resented  this,  and  Jupiter,  at  his 
request,  struck  the  bold  physician  with  lightning  and  killed  him, 
but  after  his  death  received  him  into  the  number  of  the  gods.

Homer  tells  us  that  the  cranes  used  to  migrate  every  winter  to 
the  Pygmies'  country,  and  their  appearance  was  the  signal  of 
bloody  warfare  to  the  puny  inhabitants,  who  had  to  take  up  arms 
to  defend  their  cornfields  against  the  rapacious  strangers.  The 
Pygmies  and  their  enemies,  the  Cranes,  form  the  subject  of  sev- 
eral works  of  art. 

Later  writers  tell  of  an  army  of  Pygmies  which,  finding  Her- 
cules asleep,  made  preparations  to  attack  him,  as  if  they  were 
about  to  attack  a  city.  But  the  hero,  awaking,  laughed  at  the 
little  warriors,  wrapped  some  of  them  up  in  his  lion-skin,  and 
carried  them  to  Eurystheus. 

The  Griffin,  or  Gryph'on, 

The  Griffin  is  a  monster  with  the  body  of  a  lion,  the  head  and 
wings  of  an  eagle,  and  back  covered  with  feathers.  Like  birds 
it  builds  its  nest,  and  instead  of  an  egg  lays  an  agate  therein.  It 
has  long  claws,  and  talons  of  such  a  size  that  the  people  of  that 
country  make  them  into  drinking-cups.  India  was  assigned  as 
the  native  country  of  the  Griffins.  They  found  gold  in  the 
oiountains  and  built  their  nests  of  it,  for  which  reason  their  nests 
were  very  tempting  to  the  hunters,  and  they  were  forced  to  keep 
vigilant  guard  over  them.  Their  instinct  led  them  to  know

CHAPTER  XVII. 
The  Golden  Fleece — Ja'son— Me-de'a, 

The  Golden  Fleece. 

In  very  ancient  times  there  lived  in  Thessaly  a  king  and  queen 
named  Athamas  and  Nephele.  They  had  two  children,  a  boy 
and  a  girl.  After  a  time  Athamas  grew  indifferent  to  his  wife, 
put  her  away,  and  took  another.  Nephele  suspected  danger  to 
her  children  from  the  influence  of  the  step -mother,  and  took 
measures  to  send  them  out  of  her  reach.  Mercury  assisted  her, 
and  gave  her  a  ram,  wnth  a  goldeii  fleece^  on  which  she  set  the 
two  children,  trusting  that  the  ram  would  convey  them  to  a 
place  of  safety.  The  ram  vaulted  into  the  air  with  the  children 
on  his  back,  taking  his  course  to  the  East,  till,  when  crossing  the 
strait  that  divides  Europe  and  Asia,  the  girl,  whose  name  was' 
Helle,  fell  from  his  back  into  the  sea,  which  from  her  was  called 


\ 


the  Hellespont — now  the  Dardanelles. 


*•  Where  beauteous  Helle  found  a  watery  grave.*' — Meleager. 


The  ram  continued  his  career  till  he  reached  the  kingdom  of 
Colchis,  on  the  eastern  shore  of  the  Black  Sea,  where  he  safely 
landed  the  boy  Phryxus,  who  was  hospitably  received  by  ^etes, 
the  king  of  the  country.     Phryxus  sacrificed  the  ram  to  Jupiter,

and  gave  the  golden  fleece  to  ^etes,  who  placed  it  in  a  conse- 
crated grove,  under  the  care  of  a  sleepless  dragon. 

There  was  another  kingdom  in  Thessaly  near  to  that  of  Atha« 
mas,  and  ruled  over  by  a  relative  of  his.  The  king  yf^son,  being 
.ired  of  the  cares  of  government,  surrendered  his  crown  to  his 
brother  Pelias,  on  condition  that  he  should  hold  it  only  during 
the  minority  of  Ja'son,  the  son  of  ^^son.  When  Jason  was 
grown  up  and  came  to  demand  the  crown  from  his  uncle,  Pelias 
pretended  to  be  willing  to  yield  it,  but  at  the  same  time  sug- 
gested to  the  young  man  the  glorious  adventure  of  going  in  quest 
of  the  golden  fleece,  which  it  was  well-known  was  in  the  king- 
dom of  Colchis,  and  was,  as  Pelias  pretended,  the  rightful  prop- 
erty of  their  family. 

**  From  Colchis'  realm  to  bring  the  golden  fleece 
He  charged  the  youth." — Orphic  Argonautics. 

Jason  was  pleased  with  the  thought,  and  forthwith  made  pre- 
parations for  the  expedition.  At  that  time  the  only  species  of 
navigation  known  to  the  Greeks  consisted  of  small  boats  or 
canoes  hollowed  out  from  trunks  of  trees,  so  that  when  Jason 
employed  Argus  to  build  him  a  vessel  capable  of  containing  fifty 
men,  it  was  considered  a  gigantic  undertaking. 

**  So  when  the  first  bold  vessel  dared  the  seas, 

High  on  the  stern  the  Thracian  raised  his  strain. 
While  Argo  saw  her  kindred  trees 

Descend  from  Pelion  to  the  main.

And  men  grew  heroes  at  the  sound." — PoPE. 

It  was  accomplished,  however,  and  the  vessel  named  Argo, 
from  the  name  of  the  builder.  Jason  sent  his  invitation  to  all 
the  adventurous  young  men  of  Greece,  and  soon  found  himself 
at  the  head  of  a  band  of  bold  youths,  many  of  whom  afterwards 
were  renowned  among  the  heroes  and  demigods  of  Greece. 
Hercules,  Theseus,  Orpheus  and  Nestor  were  among  them.

They  are  called  the  Argonauts,  from  the  name  of  their  vessel. 

The  Argo  with  her  crew  of  heroes  left  the  shores  of  Thessaly, 
and,  having  touched  at  the  Island  of  Lemnos,  thence  crossed  to 
Mysia,  and  thence  to  Thrace. 

*'  Then  with  a  whistling  breeze  did  Juno  fill  the  sail, 
And  Argo,  self-impell'd,  shot  swift  before  the  gale." 

— Onomacritus  (Elton's  tr.). 

'  Here  they  found  the  sage  Phineus,  and  from  him  received  in 
struction  as  to  their  future 
course.  It  seems  the  en- 
trance of  the  Euxine  Sea 
was  impeded  by  two 
small  rocky  islands,  which 
floated  on  the  surface, 
and  in  their  tossings  and 
heavings  they  occasionally 
came  together,  crushing 
and  grinding  to  atoms 
any  object  that  might  be 
caught  between  them. 
They  were  called  the  Sym- 
plegades,  or  Clashing  Isl-

the  Argonauts  how  to 
pass  this  dangerous  strait. 
When  they  reached  the 
islands  they  let  go  a  dove,

ment  of  the  rebound,  plied  their  oars  with  vigor,  and  passed  safe 
through,  though  the  islands  closed  behind  them,  and  actually 
grazed  their  stern.  They  now  rowed  along  the  shore  till  they 
arrived  at  the  eastern  end  of  the  sea,  and  landed  at  the  kingdom 
of  Colchis.

STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 


Jason  made  known  his  message  to  the  Colchian  king,  ^etes, 
who  consented  to  give  up  the  golden  fleece  if  Jason  would  yoke 
to  the  plough  two  fire-breathing  bulls  with  brazen  feet,  and  sow 
the  teeth  of  the  dragon  which  Cadmus  had  slain,  and  from 
which  it  was  well  known  that  a  crop  of  armed  men  would  spring 
up  who  would  turn  their  weapons  against  their  producer.  Jason 
accepted  the  conditions,  and  a  time  was  set  for  making  the  ex- 
periment. Previously,  however,  he  found  means  to  plead  his 
cause  to  Medea,  daughter  of  the  king.     He  promised  her  mar-

riage,  and,  as  they  stood  before  the  altar  of  Hecate,  called  the 
goddess  to  witness  his  oath.     Medea  yielded — and  by  her  aid 
for  she  was  a  potent  sorceress,  he  was  furP'shed  with  a  charn 
by  which  he  could  encounter  safely  the  breaih  of  the  fire-breatb 
Ing  bulls  and  the  weapons  of  the  armed  men. 

At  the  time  appointed  the  people  assembled  at  the  grove  of 
Mars,  and  the  king  accnmed  his  royal  seat,  while  the  multitude

covered  the  hill-sides.  The  brazen-footed  bulls  rushed  in, 
breathing  fire  from  their  nostrils  that  burned  up  the  herbage  as 
they  passed.  The  sound  was  like  the  roar  of  a  furnace,  and  the 
smoke  like  that  of  water  upon  quick-lime.  Jason  advanced 
boldly  to  meet  them.  His  friends,  the  chosen  heroes  of  Greece, 
trembled  to  behold  him.  Regardless  of  the  burning  breath,  he 
soothed  their  rage  with  his  voice,  patted  their  necks  with  fearless 
hand,  and  adroitly  slipped  over  them  the  yoke,  and  compelled 
them  to  drag  the  plough, 

**  And  how  he  yoked  the  bulls,  whose  breathings  fiery  glow'd. 
And  with  the  dragons'  teeth  the  furrow' d  acres  sow'd.'* 

— Onomacritus  (Elton's  tr.). 

The  Colchians  were  amazed ;  the  Greeks  shouted  for  joy. 
Jason  next  proceeded  to  sow  the  dragon's  teeth  and  plough  them 
in.  And  soon  the  crop  of  armed  men  sprang  up,  and — wonder- 
ful to  relate  ! — no  sooner  had  they  reached  the  surface  than  they 
began  to  brandish  their  weapons  and  rush  upon  Jason. 

*•  They,  like  swift  dogs, 
Ranging  in  fierceness,  on  each  other  turn'd 
Tumultuous  battle." — Apollonius  Rhodius  (Elton's  tr.). 

The  Greeks  trembled  for  their  hero  ;  and  even  she  who  had 
provided  him  a  way  of  safety  and  taught  him  how  to  use  it, 
Medea  herself,  grew  pale  with  fear.  Jason  for  a  time  kept  his 
assailants  at  bay  with  his  sword  and  shield,  till,  finding  their  num- 
bers overwhelming,  he  resorted  to  the  charm  which  Medea  had 
taught  him,  seized  a  stone,  and  threw  it  in  the  midst  of  his  foes. 
They  immediately  turned  their  arms  against  one  another,  and 
soon  there  was  not  one  of  the  dragon's  brood  left  alive.  The 
Greek?  embraced  their  hero,  and  Medea,  if  she  dared,  w^ould 
have  embraced  him,  too. 

It  remained  to  lull  to  sleep  the  dragon  that  guarded  the  fleece, 
and  this  was  done  by  scattering  over  him  a  few  drops  of  a  prepa- 
ration which  Medea  had  supplied.  At  the  smell  he  relaxed  his 
rage,  stood  for  a  moment  motionless,  then  shut  those  great  round 
eyes,  that  had  never  been  known  to  shut  before,  and  turned  over 
on  his  side,  fast  asleep.     Jason  seized  the  fleece, 

**  Exulting  Jason  grasped  the  shining  hide. 
His  last  of  labors,  and  his  envied  pride."

and  with  his  friends  and  Medea  accompanying,  hastened  to  theii 
vessel,  before  ^etes,  the  king,  could  arrest  their  departure,  and 
made  the  best  of  their  way  back  to  Thessaly,  where  they  arrived 
safe,  and  Jason  delivered  the  fleece  to  Pelias,  and  dedicated  the 
Argo  to  Neptune.  What  became  of  the  fleece  afterwards  we  do 
not  know,  but  perhaps  it  was  found,  after  all,  like  many  other 
golden  prizes,  not  worth  the  trouble  it  had  cost  to  procure  it. 

This  is  one  of  those  mythological  tales,  says  a  late  writer,  in 
which  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  a  substratum  of  truth  exists, 
though  overlaid  by  a  mass  of  fiction.  It  probably  was  the  first 
important  maritime  expedition,  and  like  the  first  attempts  of  the 
kind  of  all  nations,  as  we  know  from  history,  was  probably  of  a 
half-piratical  character.  If  rich  spoils  were  the  result,  it  was 
enough  to  give  rise  to  the  idea  of  the  golden  fleece. 

Another  suggestion  of  a  learned  mythologist,  Bryant,  is  that 
it  is  a  corrupt  tradition  of  the  story  of  Noah  and  the  ark.  The 
name  Argo  seems  to  countenance  this,  and  the  incident  of  the 
dove  is  another  confirmation. 

Hercules  left  the  expedition  at  Mysia,  for  Hylas,  a  youth  be- 
loved by  him,  having  gone  for  water,  was  laid  hold  of  and  kept 
by  the  nymphs  of  the  spring,  who  were  fascinated  by  his  beauty. 
Hercules  went  in  quest  of  the  lad,  and  while  he  was  absent  the 
Argo  put  to  sea  and  left  him. 

**  When  Hylas  was  sent  with  his  urn  to  the  fount. 

Through  fields  full  of  light  and  with  heart  full  of  play. 
Light  rambled  the  boy  over  meadow  and  mount. 
And  neglected  his  task  for  the  flowers  in  the  way. 

**Thus  many  like  me,  who  in  youth  shoul-3  have  tasted 
The  fountain  that  runs  by  Philosophy' a  shrine. 
Their  time  with  the  flowers  on  the  margin  have  wasted. 
And  left  their  light  urns  all  as  empty  as  mine." — MoORE. 

Me-de'a   and  iE'son. 

Amid  the  rejoicings  for  the  recovery  of  the  Golden  Fleece, 
Jason  felt  that  one  thing  was  wanting,  the  presence  of  .^'son,  his 
father,  who  was  prevented  by  his  age  and  infirmities  from  taking 
part  in  them.  Jason  said  to  Me-de'a,  **  My  spouse,  would  thai 
your  arts,  whose  power  I  have  seen  so  mighty  for  my  aid,  could 
do  me  one  further  service  :  take  some  years  from  my  life  and  add

them  to  my  father's. ' '  Medea  reph'ed,  **  Not  at  such  a  cost  shall 
it  be  done,  but  if  my  art  avails  me,  his  life  shall  be  lengthened 
without  abridging  yours."  The  next  full  moon  she  issued  forth 
alone,  while  all  creatures  slept ;  not  a  breath  stirred  the  foliage, 
and  all  was  still.  To  the  stars  she  addressed  her  incantations, 
and  to  the  moon ;  to  Hecate,*  the  goddess  of  the  under  world, 
and  to  Tellus,  the  goddess  of  the  earth,  by  whose  power  plants 
potent  for  enchantments  are  produced.  She  invoked  the  gods 
of  the  woods  and  caverns,  of  mountains  and  valleys,  of  lakes  and 
rivers,  of  winds  and  vapors.  While  she  spoke  the  stars  shone 
brighter,  and  presently  a  chariot  descended  through  the  air, 
drawn  by  flying  serpents.  She  ascended  in  it,  and,  borne  aloft, 
made  her  way  to  distant  regions,  where  potent  plants  grew  which 
she  knew  how  to  select  for  her  purpose.  Nine  nights  she  em- 
ployed in  her  search,  and  during  that  time  came  not  within  the 
doors  of  her  palace  nor  under  any  roof,  and  shunned  all  inter- 
course with  mortals. 

She  next  erected  two  altars,  the  one  to  Hecate,  the  other  to 
Hebe,  the  goddess  of  youth,  and  sacrificed  a  black  sheep,  pour- 
ing libations  of  milk  and  wine.  She  implored  Pluto  and  his 
stolen  bride  that  they  would  not  hasten  to  take  the  old  man's 
life.  Then  she  directed  that  ^son  should  be  led  forth,  and 
having  thrown  him  into  a  deep  sleep  by  a  charm,  had  him  laid 
on  a  bed  of  herbs,  like  one  dead.  Jason  and  all  others  were 
kept  away  from  the  place,  that  no  profane  eyes  might  look  upon 
her  mysteries.  Then,  with  streaming  hair,  she  thrice  moved 
round  the  altars,  dipped  flaming  twigs  in  the  blood,  and  laid 
them  thereon  to  burn.  Meanwhile  the  caldron  with  its  contents 
was  got  ready.  In  it  she  put  magic  herbs,  with  seeds  and  flowers 
of  acrid  juice,  stones  from  the  distant  east,  and  sand  from  the 
shore  of  all-surrounding  ocean ;  hoar-frost,  gathered  by  moon- 
light, a  screech-owl's  head  and  wings,  and  the  entrails  of  a  wolf

sometimes  with  Proserpine.  As  Diana  represents  the  moonlight  splendor  of 
night,  so  Hecate  represents  its  darkness  and  terrors.  She  was  the  goddess  of

MEDEA  AND  jESON.  1 69 

Medea  used  her  arts  here  for  a  good  purpose ;  but  not  so  in 
another  instance,  where  she  made  them  the  instruments  of  re- 
venge. Pelias,  our  readers  will  recollect,  was  the  usurping 
uncle  of  Jason,  and  had  kept  him  out  of  his  kingdom.  Yet  he 
must  have  had  some  good  qualities,  for  his  daughters  loved  him, 
and  when  they  saw  what  Medea  had  done  for  ^son,  they 
wished  her  to  do  the  same  for  their  father.  Medea  pretended 
to  consent,  and  prepared  her  caldron  as  before.  At  her  request 
an  old  sheep  was  brought  and  plunged  into  the  caldron.  Very 
soon  a  bleating  was  heard  in  the  kettle,  and  when  the  cover  was 
removed,  a  lamb  jumped  forth  and  ran  frisking  away  into  the 
meadow.  The  daughters  of  Pelias  saw  the  experiment  with 
delight,  and  appointed  a  time  for  their  father  to  undergo  the 
same  operation.  But  Medea  prepared  her  caldron  for  him  in  a 
very  different  way.  She  put  in  only  water  and  a  few  simple 
herbs.  In  the  night  she  with  the  sisters  entered  the  bedcham- 
ber of  the  old  king,  while  he  and  his  guards  slept  soundly  under 
the  influence  of  a  spell  cast  upon  them  by  Medea.  The  daugh- 
ters stood  by  the  bedside  with  their  weapons  drawn,  but  hesi- 
tated to  strike,  till  Medea  chid  their  irresolution.  Then,  turning 
away  their  faces,  and  giving  random  blows,  they  smote  him  with 
their  weapons.  He,  starting  from  his  sleep,  cried  out:  **My 
daughters,  what  are  you  doing?  Will  you  kill  your  father?" 
Their  hearts  failed  them  and  the  weapons  fell  from  their  hands, 
but  Medea  struck  him  a  fatal  blow,  and  prevented  his  saying  more. 

Then  they  placed  him  in  the  caldron,  and  Medea  hastened  to 
depart  in  her  serpent-drawn  chariot  before  they  discovered  her 
treachery,  or  their  vengeance  would  have  been  terrible.  She 
escaped,  however,  but  had  little  enjoyment  of  the  fruits  of  her 
crime.  Jason,  for  whom  she  had  done  so  much,  wishing  to 
marry  Creusa,  princess  of  Corinth,  put  away  Medea.  She,  en- 
raged at  his  ingratitude,  called  on  the  gods  for  vengeance,  sent 
a  poisoned  robe  as  a  gift  to  the  bride,  and  then  killing  her  own 
children  and  setting  fire  to  the  palace,  mounted  her  serpent- 
drawn  chariot  and  fled  to  Athens,  where  she  married  King 
^geus,  the  father  of  Theseus,  and  we  shall  meet  her  again  when 
we  come  to  the  adventures  of  that  hero. 

The  incantations  of  Medea  will  remind  the  reader  of  those 
of  the  witches  in  Macbeth  :

CHAPTER  XVIII. 


Me-le-a'ger — At-a-lan'ta — Cal-y-do'ni-an  Hunt. 

One  of  the  heroes  of  the  Argonautic  expedition  was  Me-le- 
a'ger,  son  of  Qi^neus  and  Althea,  king  and  queen  of  Calydon 
Althea,  when  her  son  was  born,  beheld  the  three  Destinies,  who, 
as  they  spun  their  fatal  thread,  foretold  that  the  life  of  the 
child  should  last  no  longer  than  a  brand  then  burning  upon  the 
hearth.  Althea  seized  and  quenched  the  brand,  and  carefully 
preserved  it  for  years,  while  Meleager  grew  to  boyhood,  youth, 
and  manhood.  It  chanced,  then,  that  CEneus,  as  he  offered 
sacrifices  to  the  gods,  omitted  to  pay  due  honors  to  Diana ; 
and  she,  indignant  at  the  neglect,  sent  a  wild  boar  of  enormous 
size  to  lay  waste  the  fields  of  Calydon.  Its  eyes  shone  with 
blood  and  fire,  its  bristles  stood  like  threatening  spears,  its  tusks 
were  like  those  of  Indian  elephants.  The  growing  corn  was 
trampled,  the  vines  and  olive  trees  laid  waste,  the  flocks  and 
herds  were  driven  in  wild  confusion  by  the  slaughtering  foe. 
All  common  aid  seemed  vain  ;  but  Meleager  called  on  the  heroes 
of  Greece  to  join  in  a  bold  hunt  for  the  ravenous  monster. 
Theseus  and  his  friend  Pirithous ;  Jason ;  Peleus,  afterwards  the 
father  of  Achilles  ;  Telamon,  the  father  of  Ajax ;  Nestor,  then  a 
youth,  but  who  in  his  age  bore  arms  with  Achilles  and  Ajax  in 
the  Trojan  war — these  and  many  more  joined  in  the  enterprise. 
With  them  came  At-a-lan'ta,  the  daughter  of  lasius,  king  of 
Arcadia.     A  buckle  of  polished  gold  confined  her  vest,  an  ivory

The  very  moment  that  Meleager  saw  Atalanta  he  loved  her 
But   now  already  they  were   near   the   monster's  lair.       They 

stretched  strong  nets  from 
tree  to  tree  ;  they  uncou- 
pled their  dogs,  they  tried 
to  find  the  footprints  of 
their  quarry  in  the  grass. 
From  the  wood  was  a  de- 
scent to  marshy  ground. 
Here  the  boar,  as  he  lay 
among  the  reeds,  heard 
the  shouts  of  his  pursuers, 
and  rushed  forth  against 
them.  One  and  another

Jason  throws  his  spear, 
with  a  prayer  to  Diana  for 
success,  and  the  favoring 
goddess  allows  the  weapon 
to  touch,  but  not  to  wound, 
removing  the  steel  point 
of  the  spear  even  in  its 
flight.  Nestor,  assailed, 
seeks  and  finds  safety  in 
the  branches  of  a  tree. 
Telamon  rushes  on,  but 
stumbling  at  a  projecting 
root,  falls  prone.  But  an 
arrow  from  Atalanta  at  length  for  the  first  time  tastes  the  mon- 
ster's blood.  It  is  a  slight  wound,  but  Meleager  sees  and  joy- 
fully proclaims  it.  Ancseus,  excited  to  envy  by  the  praise  given 
to  a  female,  loudly  proclaims  his  own  valor,  and  defies  alike  the 
boar  and  the  goddess  who  had  sent  it ;  Ixit  as  he  rushes  on,  the

throws  his  lance,  but  it  is  turned  aside  by  a  projecting  bough. 
The  dart  of  Jason  misses  its  object,  and  kills,  instead,  one  of  their 
own  dogs.  But  Melcager,  after  one  unsuccessful  stroke,  drives 
his  spear  into  the  monster's  side,  then  rushes  on  and  despatches 
him  with  repeated  blows. 

**  And  from  raging  lips 
Foamed  out  the  latest  wrath  of  all  his  life." — SwiNBURNE. 

Then  rose  a  shout  from  those  around ;  they  congratulated  the 
conqueror,  crowding  to  touch  his  hand.  He,  placing  his  foot 
upon  the  head  of  the  slain  boar,  turned  to  Atalanta  and  be- 
stowed on  her  the  head  and  the  rough  hide  which  were  the  tro- 
phies of  his  success.     But  at  this,  envy  excited  the  rest  to  strife. 

**  Then  one  cried,  '  Lo  now 
Shall  not  the  Acadian  shoot  out  lips  at  us, 
Saying  all  we  were  despoiled  by  this  one  girl  ?'" — SwiNBURNE. 

Plexippus  and  Toxeus,  the  brothers  of  Meleager's  mother, 
beyond  the  rest  opposed  the  gift,  and  snatched  from  the  maiden 
the  trophy  she  had  received.  Meleager,  kindling  with  rage 
at  the  wrong  done  to  himself,  and  still  more  at  the  insult  offered 
to  her  whom  he  loved,  forgot  the  claims  of  kindred  and 
plunged  his  sword  into  the  offenders'  hearts. 

As  Althaea  bore  gifts  of  thankfulness  to  the  temples  for  the 
victory  of  her  son,  the  bodies  of  her  murdered  brothers  met 
her  sight.  She  shrieks,  and  beats  her  breast,  and  hastens  to 
change  the  garments  of  rejoicing  for  those  of  mourning.  But 
when  the  author  of  the  deed  is  known,  grief  gives  way  to  the 
stern  desire  of  vengeance  on  her  son.  The  fatal  brand  which 
once  she  rescued  from  the  flames,  the  brand  which  the  Destinies 
had  linked  with  Meleager' s  life,  she  brings  forth,  and  commands 
a  fire  to  be  prepared.  Then  four  times  she  essays  to  place  the 
brand  upon  the  pile ;  four  times  draws  back,  shuddering  at  the 
thought  of  bringing  destruction  on  her  son.  The  feelings  of 
the  mother  and  the  sister  contend  within  her.  Now  she  is  pale 
at  the  thought  of  the  purposed  deed,  now  flushed  again  with 
anger  at  the  act  of  her  son.  As  a  vessel,  driven  in  one  direc- 
tion by  the  wind,  and  in  the  opposite  by  the  tide,  the  mind  of 
Althaea  hangs  suspended  in  uncertainty.     But  now  the  sister  pre

vails  above  the  mother,  and  she  begins,  as  she  holds  the  fatal 
wood :  *  *  Turn,  ye  Furies,  goddesses  of  punishment  !  turn  to 
behold  the  sacrifice  I  bring  !  Crime  must  atone  for  crime. 
Shall  (Eneus  rejoice  in  his  victor  son  while  the  house  of  Thes- 
tius  is  desolate  ?  But,  alas !  to  what  deed  am  I  borne  along  7 
Brothers,  forgive  a  mother's  weakness  !  my  hand  fails  me.  Hfj'

1;hen  live,  and  triumph  and  reign  over  Calydon,  while  you,  my 
brothers,  wander  unavenged  among  the  shades?  No !  thou 
hast  lived  by  my  gift ;  die,  now,  for  thine  own  crime.  Retur/i 
the  life  which  twice  I  gave  thee,  first  at  thy  birth,  again  when  I 
snatched  this  brand  from  the  flames.  O  that  thou  hadst  then 
died  !  Alas  !  evil  is  the  conquest;  but,  brothers,  ye  have  con- 
quered." And,  turning  away  her  face,  she  threw  the  fatal  wood 
upon  the  burning  pile. 

It  gave,  or  seemed  to  give,  a  deadly  groan.  Meleager, 
absent  and  unknowing  of  the  cause,  felt  a  sudden  pang.  He 
burns,  and  only  by  courageous  pride  conquers  the  pain  which 
destroys  him.  He  mourns  only  that  he  perishes  by  a  bloodless 
and  unhonored  death.  With  his  last  breath  he  calls  upon  his 
aged  father,  his  brother  and  his  fond  sisters,  upon  his  beloved 
Atalanta,  and  upon  his  mother,  the  unknown  cause  of  his  fate. 
The  flames  increase,  and  with  them  the  pain  of  the  hero.  Now 
both  subside  ;  now  both  are  quenched.  The  brand  is  ashes,  and 
the  life  of  Meleager  is  breathed  forth  to  the  wandering  winds. 

Althaea,  when  the  deed  was  done,  laid  violent  hands  upon  her- 
self. The  sisters  of  Meleager  mourned  their  brother  with  un- 
controllable grief;  till  Diana,  pitying  the  sorrows  of  the  house 
that  once  had  aroused  her  anger,  turned  them  into  birds. 

At-a-lan'ta. 

The  innocent  cause  of  so  much  sorrow  was  a  maiden  whose 
face  you  might  truly  say  was  boyish  for  a  girl,  yet  too  girlish  for 
a  boy.  Her  fortune  had  been  told,  and  it  was  to  this  eff"ect : 
••  At-a-lan'ta,  do  not  marry;  marriage  will  be  your  ruin." 
Terrified  by  this  oracle,  she  fled  the  society  of  men,  and  devoted 
herself  to  the  sports  of  the  chase.  To  all  suitors  (for  she  had 
many)  she  imposed  a  condition  which  was  generally  effectual  in 
relieving  her  of  their  persecutions, — **  I  will  be  the  prize  of  hira 


ATALANTA.  175 

*no  shall  conquer  me  in  the  race ;  but  death  must  be  the  pen- 
alty of  all  who  try  and  fail."  In  spite  of  this  hard  condition 
some  would  try.  Hippomenes  was  to  be  judge  of  the  race. 
**  Can  it  be  possible  that  any  will  be  so  rash  as  to  rijk  so  much 
for  a  wife  ?' '  said  he.  But  when  he  saw  her  lay  aside  her  robe 
for  the  race  he  changed  his  mind  and  said,  **  Pardon  me,  youths, 
"l  knew  not  the  prize  you  were  competing  for."  As  he  surveyed 
them  he  wished  them  all  to  be  beaten,  and  swelled  with  envy  oi 
any  one  that  seemed  at  all  likely  to  win.  While  such  were  his 
thoughts,  the  virgin  darted  forward.  As  she  ran  she  looked  more 
beautiful  than  ever.  The  breezes  seemed  to  give  wings  to  her 
feet ;  her  hair  flew  over  her  shoulders  and  the  gay  fringe  of  her

garment  fluttered  behind  her.  A  ruddy  hue  tinged  the  whiteness 
of  her  skin,  such  as  a  crimson  curtain  casts  on  a  marble  wall 
All  her  competitors  were  distanced,  and  were  put  to  death  .with- 
out mercy.  Hippomenes,  not  daunted  by  this  result,  fixing  his 
eyes  on  the  virgin,  said,  **  Why  boast  of  beating  those  laggards? 
I  offer  myself  for  the  contest.**  Atalanta  looked  at  him  with  a 
pitying  countenance,  and  hardly  knew  whether  she  would  rather 
conquer  him  or  not.  **  What  god  can  tempt  one  so  young  and 
handsome  to  throw  himself  away?  I  pity  him,  not  for  his 
beauty  (yet  he  is  beautiful),  but  for  his  youth.  I  wish  he  would 
give  up  the  race ;  or,  if  he  will  be  so  mad,  I  hope  he  may  outrun 
me.**  While  she  hesitates,  revolving  these  thoughts,  the  specta- 
tors grow  impatient  for  the  race,  and  her  father  prompts  her  to 
prepaie.  Then  Hippomenes  addressed  a  prayer  to  Venus: 
•'Help  me,  Venus,  for  you  have  led  me  on."  Venus  heard, 
and  was  propitious. 

In  the  garden  of  her  temple,  in  her  own  island  of  Cyprus,  is

SL  tree  with  yellow  leaves  and  yellow  branches,  and  golden  fruit 
Hence  she  gathered  three  golden  apples,  and,  unseen  by  any  ono 
else,  gave  them  to  Hippomenes,  and  told  him  how  to  use  them. 
The  signal  is  given ;  each  starts  for  the  goal,  and  skims  over  the 
sand.  So  light  their  tread,  you  would  almost  have  thought  they 
might  run  over  the  river  surface  or  over  the  waving  grain  with- 
out sinking.  The  cries  of  the  spectators  cheered  Hippomenes 
— *'  Now,  now  do  your  best !  haste,  haste  !  you  gain  on  her  ! 
relax  not !  one  more  effort !" 

"He  felt 
The  rapid  and  repeated  gush  of  breath 
Behind  his  shoulder.'* — W.  S.  Landor. 

It  was  doubtful  whether  the  youth  or  the  maiden  heard  these 
cries  with  the  greater  pleasure.  But  his  breath  began  to  fail  him, 
his  throat  was  dry,  the  goal  yet  far  off.  At  that  moment  he  threw 
down  one  of  the  golden  apples.  The  virgin  was  all  amazement. 
She  stopped  to  pick  it  up.  Hippomenes  shot  ahead.  Shouts 
burst  forth  from  all  sides.  She  redoubled  her  efforts,  and  soon 
overtook  him.  Again  he  threw  an  apple.  She  stopped  again, 
but  again  came  up  with  him.  The  goal  was  near  ;  one  chance 
only  remained.  **Now,  goddess,"  said  he,  **  prosper  your 
gift  r*  and  threw  the  last  apple  off  at  one  side.  She  looked  at 
it,  and  hesitated. 

*'  She  stooped  again. 
Yet  swifter  than  a  wren  picks  up  a  grain 
Of  millet,  raised  her  head;  it  was  too  late. — W.^.Landor. 

Venus  impelled  her  to  turn  aside  for  it.     She  did  so,  and  waa 

vanquished. 

"  Hippomenes  turns  her  astray 
By  the  golden  illusions  he  flings  on  her  way." — Moore. 

Amid  the  shouts  of  the  crowd  the  youth  carried  off  his  prize. 
But  the  lovers  were  so  full  of  their  own  happiness  that  they 
forgot  to  pay  due  honor  to  Venus,  and  the  goddess  was  pro- 
voked at  their  ingratitude.  She  caused  them  to  give  offence  to 
Cybele.  That  powerful  goddess  was  not  to  be  insulted  with  im- 
punity. She  took  from  them  their  human  form  and  turned  them 
into  animals  of  characters  resembling  their  own  :  of  the  huntress- 
heroine,  triumphing  in  the  blood  of  her  lovers,  she  made  a

lioness,  and  of  her  lord  and  master  a  lion,  and  yoked  them  to 
her  car,  where  they  are  still  to  be  seen  in  all  representations,  il 
statuary  or  painting,  of  the  goddess  Cybele. 

Cybele  is  the  Latin  name  of  the  goddess  called  by  the  Greeks 
Rhea  and  Ops.  She  was  the  wife  of  Cronus  and  mother  of  Zeus. 
In  works  of  art  she  exhibits  the  matronly  air  which  distinguishes 
Juno  and  Ceres.  Sometimes  she  is  veiled  and  seated  on  a  throne 
with  lions  at  her  side,  at  other  times  riding  in  a  chariot  drawn 
by  lions.  She  wears  a  mural  crown,  that  is,  a  crown  whose  rim 
is  carved  in  the  form  of  towers  and  battlements.  Her  priests 
were  called  Corybantes. 

Byron  in  describing  the  city  of  Venice,  which  is  built  on  a 
low  island  in  the  Adriatic  Sea,  borrows  an  illustration  from  Cy- 
bele:— 

•*  She  looks  a  sea- Cybele  fresh  from  ocean. 
Rising  with  her  tiara  of  proud  towers 
At  airy  distance,  with  majestic  motion, 
A  ruler  of  the  waters  and  their  powers."

CHAPTER  XIX. 
Her'cu-les — He'be  and  Gan'y-mede. 

Hercules. 

Her'cu-les  was  the  son  of  Jupiter  and  Alcmena.  As  Juno  was 
always  hostile  to  the  offspring  of  her  husband  by  mortal  mothers, 
she  declared  war  against  Hercules  from  his  birth.  She  sent  two 
serpents  to  destroy  him  as  he  lay  in  his  cradle,  but  the  preco- 
cious infant  strangled  them  with  his  own  hands. 

**  First  two  dread  Snakes  at  Juno's  vengeful  nod 
Climb'  d  round  the  cradle  of  the  sleeping  god  ; 
Waked  by  the  shrilhng  hiss,  and  rusthng  sound. 
And  shrieks  of  fair  attendants  trerabhng  round, 
TTieir  gasping  throats  with  clenching  hands  he  holds. 
And  Death  untwists  their  convoluted  folds.'* — Darwin. 

Ke  was,  however,  by  the  arts  of  Juno  rendered  subject  to  Eu- 
rysthcus  and  compelled  to  perform  all  his  commands.  Eurystheus 
enjoined  upon  him  a  succession  of  desperate  adventures,  which 
are  called  the  twelve  **  Labors  of  Hercules."  The  first  was  the 
fight  with  the  Nemean  lion.  The  valley  of  Nemea  was  infested 
by  a  terrible  lion.  Eurystheus  ordered  Hercules  to  bring  him 
the  skin  of  this  monster.  After  using  in  vain  his  club  and  arrows 
against  the  lion,  Hercules  strangled  the  animal  with  his  hands. 
He  returned,  carrying  the  dead  lion  on  his  shoulders. 

•*  The  lion  huge,  whose  tawny  hid  » 
*  And  grinning  jaws  extended  wide, 

He  o'er  his  shoulders  threw." 

— Euripides  (Woodhull). 

But  Eurystheus  was  so  frightened  at  the  sight  of  it,  and  at  this 
proof  of  the  prodigious  strength  of  the  hero,  that  he  ordered  him 
to  deliver  the  account  of  his  exploits  in  future  outside  the  town. 

His  next  labor  was  the  slaughter  of  the  Hydra.  This  monster 
ravaged  the  country  of  Argos,  and  dwelt  m  a  swamp  near  the 


RERCULES. 


179 


irell  of  Amymone.  This  well  had  been  discovered  by  Amymone 
when  the  country  was  suffering  from  drought,  and  the  story  was 
that  Neptune,  who  loved  her,  had  permitted  her  to  touch  the 
rock  with  his  trident,  and  a  spring  of  three  outlets  burst  forth. 
Here  the  Hydra  took  up  his  position,  and  Hercules  was  sent  to 
destroy  him.  The  Hydra 
had  nine  heads,  of  which  the 
Tiiddle  one  was  immortal. 
Hercules  struck  off  its  heads 
with  his  club,  but  in  the 
place  of  the  head  knocked 
off,  two  new  ones  grew  forth 
each  time.  At  length,  with 
the  assistance  of  his  faithful 
servant  lolaus,  he  burned 
away  the  heads  of  the  Hydra, 
and  buried  the  ninth,  or  im- 
mortal one,  under  a  huge 
rock. 

Another  labor  was  the 
cleaning  of  the  Augean  sta- 
bles. Augeas,  king  of  Elis, 
had  a  herd  of  three  thou- 
sand oxen,  whose  stalls  had 
not  been  cleansed  for  thirty  years.  Hercules  brought  the  rivers 
Alpheus  and  Peneus  through  them,  and  cleansed  them  thoroughly 
in  one  day. 

**  Nothing  else 
Could  the  Augean  stables  clean." — Wordsworth. 

His  next  labor  was  of  a  more  delicate  kind.  Admeta,  the 
daughter  of  Eurystheus,  longed  to  obtain  the  girdle  of  the  queen 
of  the  Amazons,  and  Eurystheus  ordered  Hercules  to  go  and  get 
it.  The  Amazons  were  a  nation  of  women.  They  were  very 
warlike,  and  held  several  flourishing  cities.  It  was  their  custom 
to  bring  up  only  the  female  children  ;  the  boys  were  either  sent 
away  to  the  neighboring  nations  or  put  to  death.  Hercules  was 
accompanied  by  a  number  of  volunteers,  and  after  various  adven- 
tures at  last  reached  the  country  of  the  Amazons.  Hippolyta, 
the  queen,  received  him  kindly,  and  consented  to  yield  him  hei

girdle ;  but  Juno,  taking  the  form  of  an  Amazon,  went  and  per- 
suaded the  rest  that  the  strangers  were  carrying  off  their  queen. 

**  The  Amazons  array  tteir  ranks 
In  painted  arms  of  radiant  sheen 
Around  Hippolyte,  the  queen.** 

— ^Virgil  (Conington's  tr.). 

They  instantly  armed  and  came  in  great  numbers  down  to  the 

ship.  Hercules,  thinking  that  Hippolyta 
had  acted  treacherously,  slew  her,  and  t?»k'j 
ing  her  girdle  made  sail  homewards. 

Another  task  enjoined  him  was  to  bring 
to  Eurystheus  the  oxen  of  Geryon,  a  mon- 
ster with  three  bodies,  who  dwelt  in  the 
island  Erytheia  (the  red),  so  called  because 
it  lay  at  the  west,  under  the  rays  of  the  set- 
ting sun.  This  description  is  thought  to 
apply  to  Spain,  of  which  Geryon  was  king. 
After  traversing  various  countries,  Hercules 
reached  at  length  the  frontiers  of  Libya  and 
Europe,  where  he  raised  the  two  moun- 
tains of  Calpe  and  Abyla,  as  monuments  of 
his  progress,  or,  according  to  another  ac- 
count, rent  one  mountain  into  two  and  left 
half  on  each  side,  forming  the  Straits  of 
Gibraltar,  the  two  mountains  being  called 
the  Pillars  of  Hercules.  The  oxen  were 
guarded  by  the  giant  Eurytion  and  his  two- 
headed  dog,  but  Hercules  killed  the  giant 
and  his  dog  and  brought  away  the  oxen  in 
safety  to  Eurystheus. 

The  most  difficult  labor  of  all  was  getting 
the  golden  apples  of  the  Hesperides,  for 
Hercules  did  not  know  where  to  find  them.  These  were  the 
apples  which  Juno  had  received  at  her  wedding  from  the  goddess 
of  the  Earth,  and  which  she  had  intrusted  to  the  keeping  of  tha 
daughters  of  Hesperis,  assisted  by  a  watchful  dragon.

HERCULES,  l8l 

After  various  adventures  Hercules  arrived  at  Mount  Atlas  in 
Africa.  Atlas  was  one  of  the  Titans  who  had  warred  against 
the  gods,  and  after  they  were  subdued.  Atlas  was  condemned  to 
bear  on  his  shoulders  the  weight  of  the  heavens.  He  was  the 
father  of  the  Hesperides,  and  Hercules  thought  might,  if  any 
one  could,  find  the  apples  and  bring  them  to  him.  But  how  to 
send  Atlas  away  from  his  post,  or  bear  up  the  heavens  while  he 
was  gone  ?  Hercules  took  the  burden  on  his  own  shoulders,  and 
Bent  Atlas  to  seek  the  apples. 

**  The  wearied  Atlas  he  relieved, 
His  arm  the  starry  realms  upheaved. 
And  propped  the  gods  above„" — Euripides. 

He  returned  with  them,  and,  though  somewhat  reluctantly, 
took  his  burden  upon  his  shoulders  again,  and  let  Hercules  re- 
tu.n  with  the  apples  to  Eurystheus.* 

The  poets,  led  by  the  analogy  of  the  lovely  appearance  of 
the  western  sky  at  sunset,  viewed  the  west  as  a  region  of  bright- 
ness and  glory.  Hence  they  placed  in  it  the  Isles  of  the  blest, 
the  ruddy  isle  Erytheia,  on  which  the  bright  oxen  of  Geryon 
were  pastured,  and  the  isle  of  the  Hesperides.  The  apples  are 
supposed  by  some  to  be  the  oranges  of  Spain,  of  which  the 
Greeks  had  heard  some  obscure  accounts. 

A  celebrated  exploit  of  Hercules  was  his  victory  over  Antaeus. 
Antaeus,  the  son  of  Terra,  the  Earth,  was  a  mighty  giant  and 
wrestler,  whose  strength  was  invincible  so  long  as  he  remained 
in  contact  with  his  mother  Earth.  He  compelled  all  strangers 
who  came  to  his  country  to  wrestle  with  him,  on  condition  that 
if  conquered  (as  they  all  were)  they  should  be  put  to  death. 
Hercules  encountered  him,  and  finding  that  it  was  of  no  avail 
to  throw  him,  for  he  always  rose  with  renewed  strength  from 
every  fall,  he  lifted  him  up  from  the  earth  and  strangled  him  in 
ihe  air. 

«*  Lifts  proud  Antoeus  from  his  mother-plains, 

And  with  strong  grasp  the  struggling  giant  strains  j 

Back  falls  his  fainting  head  and  clammy  hair.

STORIES  OF  OODS  AND  HEROES 


Cacus  was  a  huge  giant  who  inhabited  a  cave  on  Mount  Aven- 
tine  and  plundered  the  surrounding  country.  When  Hercules 
was  driving  home  the  oxen  of  Geryon,  Cacus  stole  part  of  the 
cattle  while  the  hero  slept.  That  their  footprints  might  not 
serve  to  show  where  they  had  been  driven,  he  dragged  them 
backward  by  their  tails  to  his  cave ;  so  their  tracks  all  seemed  to 

show  that  they  had  gone 
in  the  opposite  direc- 
tion. Hercules  was  de- 
ceived by  this  strata- 
gem, and  would  have 
failed  to  find  his  oxen 
if  it  had  not  happened 
that  in  driving  the  re- 
mainder of  the  herd  past 
the  cave  where  the  stolen 
ones  were  concealed, 
those  within  began  to 
low,  and  were  thus  dis- 
covered. Cacus  was 
slain  by  Hercules. 

The  last  exploit  we 
shall  record  was  bring- 
ing Cerberus  from  the 
lower  world.  Hercules 
descended  into  Hades, 
accompanied  by  Mer- 
cury and  Minerva.  He 
obtained  permission 
from  Pluto  to  carry  Cer- 
berus to  the  upper  air, 
provided  he  could  do  it  without  the  use  of  weapons  ;  and  in  spite 
of  the  monster's  struggling  he  seized  him,  held  him  fast,  and  car- 
ried him  to  Eurystheus,  and  afterwards  brought  him  back  again.

When  this  service  was  ended  he  married  Dejanira,  and  lived  in 
peace  with  her  three  years.  On  one  occasion,  as  he  was  travel- 
ling with  his  wife,  they  came  to  a  river,  across  which  the  Cen- 
taur Nessus  carried  travellers  for  a  stated  fee.  Hercules  himself 
forded  the  river,  but  gave  Dejanira  to  Nessus  to  be  carried  across. 
Nessus  attempted  to  run  away  with  her,  but  Hercules  heard  hei 
cries,  and  shot  an  arrow  into  the  heart  of  Nessus.  The  dying 
Centaur  told  Dejanira  to  take  a  portion  of  his  blood  and  keep  it, 
as  it  might  be  used  as  a  charm  to  preserve  the  love  of  her  husband. 

Dejanira  did  so,  and  before  long  fancied  she  had  occasion  to 
use  it.  Hercules  in  one  of  his  conquests  had  taken  prisoner  a 
fair  maiden,  named  lole,  of  whom  he  seemed  more  fond  than 
Dejanira  approved.  When  Hercules  was  about  to  offer  sacrifices 
to  the  gods  in  honor  of  his  victory  he  sent  to  his  wife  for  a  white 
robe  to  use  on  the  occasion.  Dejanira,  thinking  it  a  good  op- 
portunity to  try  her  love-spell,  steeped  the  garment  in  the  blood 
of  Nessus.  We  are  to  suppose  she  took  care  to  wash  out  all 
traces  of  it ;  but  the  magic  power  remained,  and  as  soon  as  the 
garment  became  warm  on  the  body  of  Hercules  the  poison  pene- 
trated into  all  his  limbs,  and  caused  him  the  most  intense  agony. 

*'  Close  to  his  sides 
And  to  each  limb,  as  by  some  artist  fixed, 
The  robe  adhered  ;  and  through  his  bones

In  his  frenzy  he  seized  Lichas,  who  had  brought  him  the  fatal

The  gods  themselves  felt  troubled  at  seeing  the  champion  of 
the  earth  so  brought  to  his  end.  But  Jupiter  with  cheerful 
countenance  thus  addressed  them  :  *  ^  I  am  pleased  to  see  your 
concern,  my  princes,  and  am  gratified  to  perceive  that  I  am  the 
ruler  of  a  loyal  people,  and  that  my  son  enjoys  your  favor.  For 
although  your  interest  in  him  arises  from  his  noble  deeds,  yet  It 
is  not  the  less  gratifying  to  me.  But  now  I  say  to  you.  Fear 
not.  He  who  conquered  all  else  is  not  to  be  conquered  by  those 
flames  which  you  see  blazing  on  Mount  (Eta.  Only  his  mother's 
share  in  him  can  perish ;  what  he  derived  from  me  is  immortal. 

I  shall  take  him,  dead  to  earth, 
to  the  heavenly  shores^  and  I 
require  of  you  all  to  receive 
him  kindly.  If  any  of  you  feel 
grieved  at  his  attaining  this 
honor,  yet  no  one  can  deny  that 
he  has  deserved  it. ' '  The  gods 
all  gave  their  assent ;  Juno  only 
heard  the  closing  words  with 
some  displeasure  that  she  should 
be  so  particularly  pointed  at,  yet 
not  enough  to  make  her  regret 
the  determination  of  her  hus- 
band. So  when  the  flames  had 
consumed  the  mother's  share  of 
Hercules,  the  diviner  part,  in- 
stead of  being  injured  thereby, 
seemed  to  start  forth  with  new

port  and  a  more  awful  dignity. 
Jupiter  enveloped  him  in  a  cloud,  and  took  him  up  in  a  four- 
horse  chariot  to  dwell  among  the  stars.  As  he  took  his  place  in 
heaven,  Atlas  felt  the  added  weight. 

Juno,  now  reconciled  to  him,  gave  him  her  daughter  Hebe  in 

marriage.

The  Story  is,  that  she  resigned 
her  office  on  becoming  the  wife 
of  Hercules.  But  there  is  another 
statement  which  our  countryman, 
Crawford,  the  sculptor,  has 
adopted  in  his  group  of  Hebe 
and  Gan'y-mede,  now  in  the 
Athen?eum  gallery.  According 
to  this,  Hebe  was  dismissed  from 
her  office  in  consequence  of  a  fall 
which  she  met  with  one  day  when 
in  attendance  on  the  gods.  Her 
successor  was  Ganymede,  a  Tro- 
jan boy  whom  Jupiter,  in  the 
disguise  of  an  eagle,  seized  and 
carried  off  from  the  midst  of  his 
playfellows  on  Mount  Ida,  bore 
up  to  heaven,  and  installed  in  the 
vacant  place.

CHAPTER  XX. 

Er'ich-tho'ni-us-  -The'seus— Dsed'a-lus — Cas'tor    and 

Pol'lux. 

Er'ich-tho'ni-us. 

Ce'crops,  half-human  and  half-dragon,  was  the  founder  of 
Athens;  the  citadel  of  which,  Cecropia,  was  named  in  his 
honor.  Neptune  and  Minerva  strove  for  the  possession  of 
Attica,  but  he  decided  in  favor  of  the  goddess.  His  successor, 
Er'ich-tho'ni-us,  was  the  son  of  Vulcan  and  Atthis.  When  a 
child,  Erichthonius,  was  concealed  in  a  chest,  and  the  box  intrusted 
to  the  three  daughters  of  Cecrops,  with  instructions  not  to  open 
the  lid.  But,  disobeying  the  command,  they  saw  the  child  in 
the  form  of  a  serpent,  whereupon  they  were  seized  with  mad- 
ness, and  threw  themselves  down  the  rock  of  the  Acropolis. 
Erichthonius  became  king  of  Athens,  and  was  succeeded  by  his 
son  Pandion.  This  king  had  two  daughters,  Procne  and  Philo- 
mela, the  former  of  whom  became  queen  to  Tereus,  king  of 
Thrace.  After  the  birth  of  their  son  Itylus,  the  king  cut  out 
his  wife's  tongue,  and  gave  out  that  she  was  dead.  He  then 
married  Philomela.  Procne  wove  her  story  in  a  web,  by  which 
means  Philomela  was  informed  of  the  terrible  fact.  The  sisteri 
then  slew  the  child  Itylus,  and  served  his  flesh  upon  his  father's 
table.  The  gods  were  angry,  and  in  vengeance  transformed 
Procne  into  a  swallow,  Philomela  into  a  nightingale,  ever 
lamenting  the  tragedy,  and  Tereus  into  a  hawk,  ever  pursuing 

the  two, 

*•  Hark  !  ah,  the  nightingale,

What  triumph  !  hark  !  what  pam  i 
O  wanderer  from  a  Grecian  shore." — Matthew  Arnoli>. 

The'seus. 

The'seus,  a  descendant  of  Erichthonius,  was  a  son  of  .^^geus, 
king  of  Athens,  and  of  .^thra,  daughter  of  the  king  of  TrcEzen.

He  was  brought  up  at  Trcezen,  and  when  arrived  at  manhood 
vas  to  proceed  to  Athens  and  present  himself  to  his  father, 
.^geus,  on  parting  from  ^^thra,  before  the  birth  of  his  son, 
placed  his  sword  and  shoes  under  a  large  stone,  and  directed  her 
to  send  his  son  to  him  when  he  became  strong  enough  to  roll 
away  the  stone  and  take  them  from  under  it.  When  she  thought 
the  time  had  come,  his  mother  led  Theseus  to  the  stone,  and  he 
amoved  it  with  ease,  and  took  the  sword  and  shoes.     As  the

roads  were  infested  with  robbers,  his  grandfather  pressed  him 
earnestly  to  take  the  shorter  and  safer  way  to  his  father's  coun- 
try, by  sea  ;  but  the  youth,  feeling  in  himself  the  spirit  and  tht'i 
soul  of  a  hero,  and  eager  to  signalize  himself  like  Hercules,  with 
whose  fame  all  Greece  then  rang,  by  destroying  the  evil-doers 
and  monsters  that  oppressed  the  country,  determined  on  the  more 
perilous  and  adventurous  journey  by  land- 

His  first  day's  journey  brought  him  to  Epidaurus,  where  dwelt

a  man  named  Periphetes,  a  son  of  Vulcan.  This  ferocious  savage 
always  went  armed  with  a  club  of  iron,  and  all  travellers  stood 
in  terror  of  his  violence.  When  he  saw  Theseus  approach,  he 
assailed  him,  but  speedily  fell  beneath  th^  blows  of  the  young 
iiero,  who  took  possession  of  his  club,  and  bore  it  ever  after- 
wards as  a  memorial  of  his  first  victory. 

Several  similar  contests  with  the  petty  tyrants  and  marauders 
of  the  country  followed,  in  all  of  which  Theseus  was  victorious 
One  of  these  evil-doers  was  called  Procrustes,  or  the  Stretcher. 
He  had  an  iron  bedstead,  on  which  he  used  to  tie  all  travellers 
who  fell  into  his  hands.  If  they  were  shorter  than  the  bed,  he 
stretched  their  limbs  to  make  them  fit  it ;  if  they  were  longer 
than  the  bed,  he  lopped  off  a  portion.  Theseus  served  him  as 
he  had  served  others. 

Having  overcome  all  the  perils  of  the  road,  Theseus  at  length 
reached  Athens,  where  new  dangers  awaited  him.  Medea,  the 
sorceress,  who  had  fled  from  Corinth  after  her  separation  from 
Jason,  had  become  the  wife  of  ^geus,  the  father  of  Theseus. 
Knowing  by  her  arts  who  he  was,  and  fearing  the  loss  of  her  influ- 
ence with  her  husband  if  Theseus  should  be  acknowledged  as 
his  son,  she  filled  the  mind  of  ^geus  w^ith  suspicions  of  the 
young  stranger,  and  induced  him  to  present  him  a  cup  of  poison  ; 
but  at  the  moment  when  Theseus  stepped  forward  to  take  it,  the 
sight  of  the  sword  which  he  wore  discovered  to  his  father  who  he 
was  and  prevented  the  fatal  draught.  Medea,  detected  in  her 
arts,  fled  once  more  from  deserved  punishment,  and  arrived  in 
Asia,  where  the  country  afterwards  called  Media  received  its 
name  from  her.  Theseus  was  acknowledged  by  his  father,  and 
declared  his  successor. 

The  Athenians  were  at  that  time  in  deep  affliction,  on  account 
of  the  tribute  which  they  were  forced  to  pay  to  Minos,  king  of 
Crete.  This  tribute  consisted  of  seven  youths  and  seven  maidens, 
who  were  sent  every  year  to  be  devoured  by  the  Minotaur,  a 
monster  with  a  bull's  body  and  a  human  head.  It  was  exceed- 
ingly strong  and  fierce,  and  was  kept  in  a  labyrinth  constructed 
by  Daedalus,  so  artfully  contrived  that  whoever  was  enclosed  in 
it  could  by  no  means  find  his  way  out  unassisted.  Here  the 
Minotaur  roamed,  and  was  fed  with  human  victims. 

Theseus  resolved  to  deliver  his  countrymen  from  this  calsLar*^

promised  his  father  to  change  for  white,  in  case  of  his  returning 
victorious.  When  they  arrived  in  Crete,  the  youths  and 
maidens  were  exhibited  before  Minos;  and  Ariadne,  the  daugh- 
ter of  the  king,  being  present,  became  deeply  enamored  of 
TheseuSj  by  whom  her  love  was  readily  returned.  She  furnished 
him  with  a  sword,  with  which  to  encounter  the  Minotaur,  and 
with  a  clew  of  thread  by  which  he  might  find  his  way  out  of  the 

labyrinth. 

*'  And  the  slender  clew, 
Prepar'd  in  secret  by  th'  enamor'd  maid,

He  was  successful,  slew  the  Minotaur,  escaped  from  the  laby- 
rinth, and  taking  Ariadne  as  the  companion  of  his  way,  with  his 
rescued  companions  sailed  for  Athens.  On  their  way  they 
stopped  at  the  island  of  Naxos,  where  Theseus  abandoned 
Ariadne,  leaving  her  asleep. 

**  Thus  is  it  far  from  my  home,  O  Traitor,  and  far  from  its  altars. 
Thus  on  a  desert  strand,  dost  leave  me,  treacherous  Theseus." 

Catullus  (Gayley'3  tr.). 

His  excuse  for  this  ungrateful  treatment  of  his  benefactress 
was  that  Minerva  appeared  to  him  in  a  dream  and  commanded 
him  to  do  so. 

On  approaching  the  coast  of  Attica,  Theseus  forgot  the  signal 
appointed  by  his  father,  and  neglected  to  raise  the  white  sails, 
and  the  old  king,  thinking  his  son  had  perished,  put  an  end  to 
his  own  life. 

"  But  novi^  bis  father  from  the  ramparts'  height. 
All  bath'd  in  tears,  directs  his  eager  sight ; 
O'er  the  wide  sea,  distended  by  the  gale. 
He  spies,  with  dread  amaze,  the  lurid  sail." — CATULLUS. 

Thus  Theseus  on  the  death  of  his  father  became  king  of  Athens. 

One  of  the  most  celebrated  of  the  adventures  of  Theseus  is 
his  expedition  against  the  Amazons.  He  assailed  them  before 
they  had  recovered  from  the  attack  of  Hercules,  and  carried  off 
their  queen,  Antiope.  The  Amazons  in  their  turn  invaded  the 
country  of  Athens,  and  penetrated  into  the  city  itself,  and  the 
final  battle  in  which  Theseus  overcame  them  was  fought  in  the

very  midst  of  the  city.  This  battle  was  one  of  the  favorite 
subjects  of  the  ancient  sculptors,  and  is  commemorated  in  severai 
works  of  art  that  are  still  extant. 

The  friendship  between  Theseus  and  Pirithous  was  of  a  most 
mtimate  nature,  yet  it  originated  in  the  midst  of  arms.  Pirithous 
had  made  an  irruption  into  the  plain  of  Marathon,  and  carried 
off  the  herds  of  the  king  of  Athens.  Theseus  went  to  repel  the 
j.)iunderers.  The  moment  Pirithous  beheld  him  he  was  seized 
with  admiration  ;  he  stretched  out  his  hand  as  a  token  of  peaces 
and  cried,  **Be  judge  thyself, — what  satisfaction  dost  thou 
require?'*  " Thy  friendship, "  replied  the  vVthenian,  and  they 
swore  inviolable  fidelity.  Their  deeds  corresponded  to  their

of  them  aspired  to  espouse  a  daughter  of  Jupiter.     Theseus  fixed 

his  choice  on  Helen,  then  but  a  child,  afterwards  so  celebrated 

as  the  cause  of  the  Trojan  war,  and  with  the  aid  of  his  friend 

he  carried  her  off.

tious  lover  in  his  descent  to  the  under  world.  But  Pluto  seized 
and  set  them  on  an  enchanted  rock  at  his  palace  gate,  where 
they  remained  till  Hercules  arrived  and  liberated  Theseus, 
leaving  Pirithous  to  his  fate. 

After  the  death  of  Antiope,  Theseus  married  Phaedra,  daugh- 
ter of  Minos,  king  of  Crete.  Phaedra  saw  in  Hippolytus,  the 
son  of  Theseus,  a  youth  endowed  with  all  the  graces  and  vir- 
tues of  his  father,  and  of  an  age  corresponding  to  her  own.  She 
loved  him,  but  he  repulsed  her  advances,  and  her  love  was 
changed  to  hate.  She  used  her  influence  over  her  infatuated 
husband  to  cause  him  to  be  jealous  of  his  son,  and  he  impre- 
cated the  vengeance  of  Neptune  upon  him.  As  Hippolytus  was 
one  day  driving  his  chariot  along  the  shore,  a  sea-monster  raised 
himself  above  the  waters,  and  frightened  the  horses  so  that  they 
ran  away  and  dashed  the  chariot  to  pieces.  Hippolytus  was 
killed,  but  by  Diana's  assistance -^sculapius  restored  him  to  life. 
Diana  removed  Hippolytus  from  the  power  of  his  deluded  father 
md  false  step -mother,  and  placed  him  in  Italy  under  the  protec- 
tion of  the  nymph  Egeria. 

Theseus  at  length  lost  the  favor  of  his  people,  and  retired  to 
the  court  of  Lycomedes,  king  of  Scyros,  who  at  first  received 
him  kindly,  but  afterwards  treacherously  slew  him.  In  a  later 
age  the  Athenian  general  Cimon  discovered  the  place  where  his 
remains  were  laid,  and  caused  them  to  be  removed  to  Athens, 
where  they  were  deposited  in  a  temple  called  the  Theseum, 
erected  in  honor  of  the  hero. 

The  queen  of  the  Amazons  whom  Theseus  espoused  is  by  some 
called  Hippolyta.  That  is  the  name  she  bears  in  Shakspeare's 
**  Midsummer  Night's  Dream,"  the  subject  of  which  is  the  fes- 
tivities attending  the  nuptials  of  Theseus  and  Hippolyta. 

Mrs.  Hemans  has  a  poem  on  the  ancient  Greek  tradition  that 
the  '*  Shade  of  Theseus"  appeared  strengthening  his  country- 
men at  the  battle  of  Marathon. 

Theseus  is  a  semi -historical  personage.  It  is  recorded  of  him 
that  he  united  the  several  tribes  by  whom  the  territory  of  Attica 
was  then  possessed  into  one  state,  of  which  Athens  was  the  capi- 
tal. In  commemoration  of  this  important  event,  he  instituted 
the  festival  of  Panathenaea,  in  honor  of  Minerva,  the  patron  deity 
of  Athens.     This  festival  differed  from  the  other  Grecian  games

OLYMPIC  AND  OTHER  GAMES,  197 

chiefly  in  two  particulars.  It  was  peculiar  to  the  Athenians,  and 
its  chief  feature  was  a  solemn  procession  in  which  the  Peplus  oi 
sacred  robe  of  Minerva  was  carried  to  the  Parthenon,  and  sus- 
pended before  the  statue  of  the  goddess.  The  Peplus  was  cov- 
ered with  embroidery,  worked  by  select  virgins  of  the  noblest 
families  in  Athens.  The  procession  consisted  of  persons  of  all 
ages  and  both  sexes.  The  old  men  carried  olive-branches  in 
their  hands,  and  the  young  men  bore  arms.  The  young  women 
carried  baskets  on  their  heads,  containing  the  sacred  utensils, 
cakes,  and  all  things  necessary  for  the  sacrifices.  The  procession 
formed  the  subject  of  the  bas-reliefs  which  embellished  the  out- 
side of  the  temple  of  the  Parthenon.  A  considerable  portion  of 
these  sculptures  is  now  in  the  British  Museum  among  those 
known  as  the  "  Elgin  marbles." 

O-lym'pic  and  Other  Games. 

It  seems  not  inappropriate  to  mention  here  the  other  celebrated 
national  games  of  the  Greeks.  The  first  and  most  distinguished 
were  the  Olympic,  founded,  it  was  said,  by  Jupiter  himself. 
They  were  celebrated  at  Olympia  in  Elis.  Vast  numbers  of  spec- 
tators flocked  to  them  from  every  part  of  Greece,  and  from 
Asia,  Africa  and  Sicily.  They  were  repeated  every  fifth  year  in 
midsummer,  and  continued  five  days.  They  gave  rise  to  the  cus- 
tom of  reckoning  time  and  dating  events  by  Olympiads.  The 
first  Olympiad  is  generally  considered  as  corresponding  with  the 
year  776  B.C.  The  Pythian  games  were  celebrated  in  the  vi- 
cinity of  Delphi,  the  Isthmian  on  the  Corinthian  isthmus,  the 
Nemean  at  Nemea,  a  city  of  Argolis. 

The  exercises  in  these  games  were  of  five  sorts,  running,  leap- 
ing, wrestling,  throwing  the  quoit,  and  hurling  the  javelin,  or 
boxing.  Besides  these  exercises  of  bcdily  strength  and  agility, 
there  were  contests  in  music,  poetry,  and  eloquence.  Thus  these 
games  furnished  poets,  musicians  and  authors  the  best  oppor- 
tunities to  present  their  productions  to  the  public,  and  the  fame 
of  the  victors  was  diffused  far  and  wide. 

Daed'a-lus. 

The  labyrinth  from  which  Theseus  escaped  by  means  of  the 
dew  of  Ariadne  was  built  by  Daed'a-lus,  a  most  skilful  artificer.

It  waL  an  edifice  with  numberless  winding  passages  and  turnings

Daedalus  and  Icarus  (J.  M.  \^m\ 


Daedalus  built  the  labyrinth  for  King  Minos,  but  afterwards  lost 
the  favor  of  the  king,  and  was  shut  up  in  a  tower.  He  contrived 
to  make  his  escape  from  his  prison,  but  could  not  leave  the  island 
by  sea,  as  the  king  kept  strict  watch  on  all  the  vessels,  and 


D.^DALUS.  199 

permitted  none  to  sail  without  being  carefully  searched.  "  Minos 
may  control  the  land  and  sea,*'  said  Daedalus,  **but  not  the  re- 
gions of  the  air.  I  will  try  that  way.*'  So  he  set  to  work  to 
fabricate  wings  for  himself  and  his  young  son  Icarus.  He  wrought 
feathers  together,  beginning  with  the  smallest  and  adding  larger, 
so  as  to  form  an  increasing  surface.  The  larger  ones  he  secured 
with  thread,  and  the  smaller  with  wax,  and  gave  the  whole  a 
gentle  curvature  like  the  wings  of  a  bird.  Icarus,  the  boy,  stood 
and  looked  on,  sometimes  running  to  gather  up  the  feathers 
which  the  wind  had  blown  away,  and  then  handling  the  wax  and 
working  it  over  with  his  fingers,  by  his  play  impeding  his  lather 
in  his  labors.  When  at  last  the  work  was  done,  the  artist,  wav- 
ing his  wings,  found  himself  buoyed  upwards  and  hung  suspended, 
poising  himself  on  the  beaten  air.  He  next  equipped  his  son  in 
the  same  manner,  and  taught  him  how  to  fly,  as  a  bird  tempts 
her  young  ones  from  the  lofty  nest  into  the  air.  When  all  was 
prepared  for  flight  he  said,  **  Icarus,  my  son,  I  charge  you  to 
keep  at  a  moderate  height,  for  if  you  fly  too  low  the  damp  will 
clog  your  wings,  and  if  too  high  the  heat  will  melt  them.  Keep 
near  me  and  you  will  be  safe.'* 


<< « 


My  Icarus !'  he  says ;  *  I  warn  thee  fly 
Along  the  middle  track  :  nor  low,  nor  high ; 
If  low,  thy  plumes  may  flag  with  ocean's  spray ; 
If  high,  the  sun  may  dart  his  fiery  ray.*  " 

—Ovid  (Elton's  tr.). 

While  he  gave  him  these  instructions  and  fitted  the  wings  to 
his  shoulders,  the  face  of  the  father  was  wet  with  tears,  and  his 
hands  trembled.  He  kissed  the  boy,  not  knowing  that  it  was 
for  the  last  time.  Then  rising  on  his  wings,  he  flew  off",  en- 
couraging him  to  follow,  and  looked  back  from  his  own  flight  to 
see  how  his  son  managed  his  wings.  As  they  flew  the  ploughman 
stopped  his  work  to  gaze,  and  the  shepherd  leaned  on  his  staff 
and  watched  them,  astonished  at  the  sight,  and  thinking  they 
were  gods  who  could  thus  cleave  the  air. 

They  passed  Samos  and  Delos  on  the  left  and  Lebynthos  on 
the  right,  when  the  boy,  exulting  in  his  career,  began  to  leave 
Ihe  guidance  of  his  companion  and  soar  upward,  as  if  to  reach 
beaven.     The   nearness  of  the  blazing  sun  softened  the  waj

which  held  the  feathers  together,  and  they  came  off.  He  fltrt 
tered  with  his  arms,  but  no  feathers  remained  to  hold  the  air. 
While  his  mouth  uttered  cries  to  his  father  it  was  submerged  in 
the  blue  waters  of  the  sea,  which  thenceforth  was  called  by  hii 
name.  His  father  cried,  "Icarus,  Icarus,  where  are  you?" 
At  last  he  saw  the  feathers  floating  on  the  water,  and  bitterly 
lamenting  his  own  arts,  he  buried  the  body  and  called  the  land 
Icaria,  in  memory  of  his  child. 

**  His  scattered  plumage  danced  upon  the  wave. 
And  sorrowing  Nereids  decked  his  watery  grave; 
O'er  his  pale  corse  their  pearly  sea- flowers  shed. 
And  strewed  with  crimson  moss  his  marble  bed. 
Struck  in  their  coral  towers  the  passing  bell, 
And  wide  in  ocean  tolled  his  echoing  knell.'* — Darwin. 

Daedalus  arrived  safe  in  Sicily,  where  he  built  a  temple  to 
Apollo,  and  hung  up  his  wings,  an  offering  to  the  god. 

Daedalus  was  so  proud  of  his  achievements  that  he  could  not 
bear  the  idea  of  a  rival.  His  sister  had  placed  her  son  Perdix 
under  his  charge,  to  be  taught  the  mechanical  arts.  He  was  an 
apt  scholar,  and  gave  striking  evidences  of  ingenuity.  Walking 
on  the  seashore,  he  picked  up  the  spine  of  a  fish.  Imitating  it, 
he  took  a  piece  of  iron  and  notched  it  on  the  edge,  and  thus 
invented  the  saw.  He  put  two  pieces  of  iron  together,  con- 
necting them  at  one  end  with  a  rivet,  and  sharpening  the  other 
ends,  and  made  a  pair  of  compasses.  Daedalus  was  so  envious 
of  his  nephew's  performances  that  he  took  an  opportunity, 
when  they  were  together  one  day  on  the  top  of  a  high  tower, 
to  push  him  off.  But  Minerva,  who  favors  ingenuity,  saw  him 
falling,  and  arrested  his  fate  by  changing  him  into  a  bird  called 
after  his  name,  the  Partridge.  This  bird  does  not  build  his  nest 
in  the  trees,  nor  take  lofty  flights,  but  nestles  in  the  hedges; 
and,  mindful  of  his  fall,  avoids  high  places. 

Cas'tor  and  Pol'lux. 

Cas'tor  and  Pol'lux  were  the  offspring  of  Leda  and  the 
Swan,  under  which  disguise  Jupiter  had  concealed  himself. 
Leda  gave  birth  to  an  ^gg^  from  which  sprang  the  twins. 
Helen,  so  famous  aftenvards  as  the  cause  of  the  Trojan  war,  wai 
their  sister. 


OA8T0B  AND  POLLUX.  aoi 

When  Theseus  and  his  friend  Pirithous  had  carried  off  Helen 
from  Sparta,  the  youthful  heroes,  Castor  and  Pollux,  with  then 
followers,  hastened  to  her  rescue.  Theseus  was  absent  from 
Attica,  and  the  brothers  were  successful  in  recovering  theii 
sister. 

Castor  was  famous  for  taming  and  managing  horses,  and 
Pollux  for  skill  in  boxing.  They  were  united  by  the  warmest 
iffection  and  inseparable  in  all  their  enterprises.  They  accom- 
panied the  Argonautic  expedition.  During  the  voyage  a  storm 
arose,  and  Orpheus  prayed  to  the  Samothracian  gods,  and  played 
on  his  harp,  whereupon  the  storm  ceased  and  stars  appeared  on 
the  heads  of  the  brothers.  From  this  incident  Castor  and  Pollux 
came  afterwards  to  be  considered  the  patron  deities  of  seamen 
and  voyagers,  and  the  lambent  flames  which  in  certain  states 
of  the  atmosphere  play  round  the  sails  and  masts  of  vessels 
were  called  by  their  names. 

After  the  Argonautic  expedition,  we  find  Castor  and  Pollux 
engaged  in  a  war  with  Idas  and  Lynceus.  Castor  was  slain, 
and  Pollux,  inconsolable  for  the  loss  of  his  brother,  besought 
Jupiter  to  be  permitted  to  give  his  own  life  as  a  ransom  for  him. 
Jupiter  so  far  consented  as  to  allow  the  two  brothers  to  enjoy 
the  boon  of  life  alternately,  passing  one  day  under  the  earth 
and  the  next  in  the  heavenly  abodes.  According  to  another 
form  of  the  story,  Jupiter  rewarded  the  attachment  of  the 
brothers  by  placing  them  among  the  stars  as  Gemini,  the 
Twins. 

They  received  divine  honors  under  the  name  of  Dioscuri  (sons 
of  Jove).     They  were  believed  to  have  appeared  occasionally 
in  later  times,  taking  part  with  one  side  or  the  other,  in  hard 
fought  fields,  and  were  said  on  such  occasions  to  be  mcimted  or 
Tiagnificent  white  steeds. 

'*  So  like  they  were,  no  mortal 

Might  one  from  other  know ; 
White  as  snow  their  armor  was. 

Their  steeds  were  white  as  snow. 
Never  on  earthly  anvil 

Did  such  rare  armor  gleam, 

Apd  never  did  such  gallant  steeds 

Drink  of  an  earthly  Btream.

BACCHUS,

CHAPTER  XXI. 
Sem'e-le — Bac'chus — A-ri-ad'ne. 


Bac'chus. 

Bac'chus  was  the  son  of  Jupiter  and  Sem'e-le.     Juno,  to 

gratify  her  resentment  against  Semele,  contrived  a  plan  for  her 

destruction.     Assuming  the  form  of  Beroe,  her  aged  nurse,  she 

insinuated  doubts  whether  it  was  indeed  Jove  himself  who  came 

as  a  lover. 

**  A  cunning  cheat 
From  Attica,  disguised  as  Zeus, 
And  robbing  thee  of  honor,  shame  and  virtue." — ScHILLER. 

Heaving  a  sigh,  she  said,  "  I  hope  it  will  turn  out  so,  but  1

can' t  help  being  afraid.  People  are  not  always  what  they  pre* 
tenA  to  be.  If  he  is  indeed  Jove,  make  him  give  some  proof  of 
it.  Ask  him  to  come  arrayed  in  all  his  splendors,  such  as  he 
wears  in  heaven.  That  will  put  the  matter  beyond  a  doubt. " 
Semele  was  persuaded  to  try  the  experiment.  She  asks  a  favor 
without  naming  what  it  is.    Jove  gives  his  promise,  and  confirms

it  with  the  irrevocable  oath,  attesting  the  river  Styx,  terrible  ta 
the  gods  themselves. 


<(  t 


Bear  me  witness,  Earth,  and  ye,  broad  Heavens 
Above  us,  and  ye,  waters  of  the  Styx, 
That  flow  beneath  us,  mightiest  oath  of  all. 
And  most  revered  by  the  blessed  gods.'  " 

— Homer  (Bryant's  tr.). 

Then  she  made  known  her  request.  The  god  would  have 
stopped  her  as  she  spake,  but  she  was  too  quick  for  him.  The 
words  escaped,  and  he  could  neither  unsay  his  promise  nor  her 
request.  In  deep  distress  he  left  her  and  returned  to  the  upper 
regions.  There  he  clothed  himself  in  his  splendors,  not  putting 
on  all  his  terrors,  as  when  he  overthrew  the  giants,  but  what  is 
known  among  the  gods  as  his  lesser  panoply.  Arrayed  in  this  he 
entered  the  chamber  of  Semele. 

**  Th'  illustrious  god,  descending  from  his  height, 
Came  rushing  on  her  in  a  storm  of  light." 

— Ovid  (Addison's  tr.). 

Her  mortal  frame  could  not  endure  the  splendors  of  the  im- 
mortal radiance.     She  was  consumed  to  ashes. 

*'  Semele  of  the  flowing  hair 
Who  died  in  Thunder's  crashing  flame, 
To  deified  existence  came." — Prior. 

The  goddess  had  finally  succeeded,  but  not  as  she  intended. 

Jove  took  the  infant  Bacchus  and  gave  him  in  charge  to  the 
Nysaean  nymphs,  who  nourished  his  infancy  and  childhood,  and 
for  their  care  were  rewarded  by  Jupiter  by  being  placed,  as  the 
Hyades,  among  the  stars.  When  Bacchus  grew  up  he  discovered 
the  culture  of  the  vine  and  the  mode  of  extracting  its  precious 
juice ;  but  Juno  struck  him  with  madness,  and  drove  him  forth  a 
wanderer  through  various  parts  of  the  earth.  In  Phrygia  the 
goddess  Rhea  cured  him  and  taught  him  her  religious  rites,  and 
he  set  out  on  a  progress  through  Asia,  teaching  the  people  the 
cultivation  of  the  vine.  The  most  famous  part  of  his  wanderings 
is  his  expedition  to  India,  which  is  said  to  have  lasted  several 
years.  Returning  in  triumph,  he  undertook  to  introduce  his  wor- 
ship into  Greece,  but  was  opposed  by  some  princes,  who  dreaded

Its  introduction  on  account  of  the  disorders  and  madness  it 
brought  with  it. 

As  he  approached  his  native  city  Thebes,  Pentheus,  the  king, 
who  had  no  respect  for  the  new  worship,  forbade  its  rites  to  be 
performed.  But  when  it  was  known  that  Bacchus  was  advanc- 
ing, men  and  women,  but  chiefly  the  latter,  young  and  old, 
poured  fourth  to  meet  him  and  to  join  his  triumphal  march. 

t 
**  Fauns  with  youthful  Bacchus  follow  ; 

Ivy  crowns  that  brow,  supernal 

As  the  forehead  of  Apollo, 

And  possessing  youth  eternal. 

•*  Round  about  him  fair  Bacchantes, 

Bearing  cymbals,  flutes  and  thyrses. 
Wild  from  Naxian  groves  or  Zante's 

Vineyards,  sing  delirious  verses." — Longfellow. 

It  was  in  vain  Pentheus  remonstrated,  commanded  and 
threatened.  **  Go,"  said  he  to  his  attendants,  **  seize  this  vaga- 
bond leader  of  the  rout,  and  bring  him  to  me.  I  will  soon  make 
him  confess  his  false  claim  of  heavenly  parentage  and  renounce 
his  counterfeit  worship."  It  was  in  vain  his  nearest  friends 
and  wisest  counsellors  remonstrated  and  begged  him  not  to 
oppose  the  god.  Their  remonstrances  only  made  him  more 
violent. 

But  now  the  attendants  returned  whom  he  had  despatched  to 
seize  Bacchus.  They  had  been  driven  away  by  the  Bacchanals, 
but  had  succeeded  in  taking  one  of  them  prisoner,  whom,  with 
his  hands  tied  behind  him,  they  brought  before  the  king.  Pen- 
theus, beholding  him  with  wrathful  countenance,  said,  *'  Fellow  ! 
you  shall  speedily  be  put  to  death,  that  your  fate  may  be  a  warn- 
ing to  others ;  but  though  I  grudge  the  delay  of  your  punish- 
ment, speak,  tell  us  who  you  are,  and  what  are  these  new  rites 
you  presume  to  celebrate." 

The  prisoner,  unterrified,  responded,  **My  name  is  Acetes ; 
my  country  is  Maeonia ;  my  parents  were  poor  people,  who  had 
no  fields  or  flocks  to  leave  me,  but  they  left  me  their  fishing- 
rods  and  nets  and  their  fisherman's  trade.  This  I  followed  for 
some  time,  till,  growing  weary  of  remaining  in  one  place,  I  learned 
the  pilot's  art  and  how  to  guide  my  course  by  the  stars.    It  hap-

pened,  as  I  was  sailing  for  Delos,  we  touched  at  the  island  of  Dia 
and  went  ashore.  Next  morning  I  sent  the  men  for  fresh  watei^ 
and  myself  mounted  the  hill  to  observe  the  wind  ;  when  my  men 
returned  bringing  with  them  a  prize,  as  they  thought,  a  boy  of 
delicate  appearance,  whom  they  had  found  asleep.  They  judged 
he  was  a  noble  youth,  perhaps  a  king's  son,  and  they  might  get 
a  liberal  ransom  for  him.  I  observed  his  dress,  his  walk,  his 
'ace.  There  was  something  in  them  which  I  felt  sure  was  more 
than  mortal.  I  said  to  my  men,  *  What  god  there  is  concealed 
in  that  form  I  know  not,  but  some  one  there  certainly  is.  Par- 
don us,  gentle  deity,  for  the  violence  we  have  done  you,  and 
give  success  to  our  undertakings.*  Dictys,  one  of  my  best  hands 
for  climbing  the  mast  and  coming  down  by  the  ropes,  and  Me- 
lanthus  my  steersman,  and  Epopeus  the  leader  of  the  sailors'  cry, 
one  and  all  exclaimed,  '  Spare  your  prayers  for  us.'  So  blind  is 
the  lust  of  gain  !  When  they  proceeded  to  put  him  on  board  I 
resisted  them.  *  This  ship  shall  not  be  profaned  by  such  im- 
piety,' said  I.  *  I  have  a  greater  share  in  her  than  any  of  you.' 
But  Lycabas,  a  turbulent  fellow,  seized  me  by  the  throat  and  at- 
tempted to  throw  me  overboard,  and  I  scarcely  saved  myself  by 
clinging  to  the  ropes.     The  rest  approved  the  deed. 

**Then  Bacchus  (for  it  was  indeed  he),  as  if  shaking  off  his 
drowsiness,  exclaimed,  *  What  are  you  doing  with  me  ?  What  is 
this  fighting  about  ?  Who  brought  me  here  ?  Where  are  you 
going  to  carry  me  ?'  One  of  them  replied,  *  Fear  nothing  ;  telJ 
us  where  you  wish  to  go  and  we  will  take  you  there.'  *  Naxos 
is  my  home, '  said  Bacchus  ;  *  take  me  there  and  you  shall  be  well 
rewarded.*  They  promised  so  to  do,  and  told  me  to  pilot  the 
ship  to  Naxos.  Naxos  lay  to  the  right,  and  I  was  trimming  the 
sails  to  carry  us  there,  when  some  by  signs  and  others  by  whis- 
pers signified  to  me  their  will  that  I  should  sail  in  the  opposite 
direction,  and  take  the  boy  to  Egypt,  to  sell  him  for  a  slave.  I 
was  confounded  and  said,  *  Let  some  one  else  pilot  the  ship  ;* 
withdrawing  myself  from  any  further  agency  in  their  wickedness. 
They  cursed  me,  and  one  of  them,  exclaiming,  *  Don't  flatter  your- 
self that  we  depend  on  you  for  our  safety,'  took  my  place  as 
pilot,  and  bore  away  from  Naxos. 

**Then  the  god,  pretending  that  he  had  just  become  aware  of 
their  treachery,  looked  out  over  the  sea  and  said,  in  a  voice  of

weeping,  *  Sailors,  these  are  not  the  shores  you  promised  to  take 
me  to  ;  yonder  island  is  not  my  home.  What  have  I  done  that

ing a  poor  boy.'  I  wept  to  hear  him,  but  the  crew  laughed  at 
both  of  us,  and  sped  the  vessel  fast  over  the  sea.  All  at  once — 
strange  as  it  may  seem,  it  is  true — the  vessel  stopped  in  the  mid 
sea,  as  fast  as  if  it  was  fixed  on  the  ground.  The  men,  aston- 
ished, pulled  at  their  oars  and  spread  more  sail,  trying  to  make 
progress  by  the  aid  of  both,  but  all  in  vain.  Ivy  twined  round 
the  oars  and  hindered  their  motion,  and  clung  to  the  sails,  with 
heavy  clusters  of  berries.  A  vine,  laden  with  grapes,  ran  up  the 
mast  and  along  the  sides  of  the  vessel.  The  sound  of  flutes  was 
heard  and  the  odor  of  fragrant  wine  spread  all  around.  The  god 
himself  had  a  chaplet  of  vine  leaves,  and  bore  in  his  hand  a  spear 
wreathed  with  ivy.  Tigers  crouched  at  his  feet,  and  forms  of 
lynxes  and  spotted  panthers  played  around  him.  The  men  were 
seized  with  terror  or  madness  ;  some  leaped  overboard  ;  others, 
prepai  ing  to  do  the  same,  beheld  their  companions  in  the  water 
undergoing  a  change,  their  bodies  becoming  flattened  and  end* 
iiig  in  a  crooked  tail. 

**  Bacchus  that  first  from  out  the  purple  grape 
Crushed  the  sweet  poison  of  misused  wine, 
After  the  Tuscan  mariners  transformed, 
Coasting  the  Tyrrhene  shore  as  the  winds  listed 
On  Circe's  island  fell ;  (who  knows  not  Circe, 
The  daughter  of  the  Sun  ?  whose  charmed  cup 
Whoever  tasted  lost  his  upright  shape, 
And  downward  fell  into  a  grovelling  swine."  ) 

— Milton's  Comus. 

"One exclaimed,  *  What  miracle  is  this  !*  and  as  he  spoke  his 
mouth  widened,  his  nostrils  expanded,  and  scales  covered  all  his 
body.  Another,  endeavoring  to  pull  the  oar,  felt  his  hand  shrink 
up,  and  presently  to  be  no  longer  hands  but  fins  ;  another,  trying 
to  raise  his  arms  to  a  rope,  found  he  had  no  arms,  and,  curving  his 
mutilated  body,  jumped  into  the  sea.  What  had  been  his  legs 
became  the  two  ends  of  a  crescent-shaped  tail.  The  whole  crew 
became  dolphins  and  swam  about  the  ship,  now  upon  the  surface,

Pentheus  here  exclaimed,  **We  have  wasted  time  enough  on 
this  silly  story.  Take  him  away  and  have  him  executed  without 
delay. ' '  Acetes  was  led  away  by  the  attendants  and  shut  up  fast 
in  prison  ;  but  while  they  were  getting  ready  the  instruments  of 
execution  the  prison  doors  came  open  of  their  own  accord  and 
the  chains  fell  from  his  limbs,  and  when  they  looked  for  him  he 
was  nowhere  to  be  found. 

Pentheus  would  take  no  warning,  but  instead  of  sending 
others,  determined  to  go  himself  to  the  scene  of  the  solemnities. 
The  mountain  Cithaeron  was  all  alive  with  worshippers,  and  the 
cries  of  the  Bacchanals  resounded  on  every  side. 

•*  *  We  follow  Bacchus  !     Bacchus  on  the  wing, 
A  conquering ! 
Bacchus,  young  Bacchus !  good  or  ill  betide. 
We  dance  before  him  thorough  kingdoms  wide.'  " — Keats. 

The  noise  roused  the  anger  of  Pentheus  as  the  sound  of  a 
trumpet  does  the  fire  of  a  war-horse.  He  penetrated  through 
the  wood  and  reached  an  open  space  where  the  chief  scene  of 
the  orgies  met  his  eyes.  At  the  same  moment  the  women  saw 
him  ;  and  first  among  them  his  own  mother,  Agave,  blinded  by 
the  god,  cried  out,  *'  See  there  the  wild  boar,  the  hugest  mon- 
ster that  prowls  in  these  woods  !  Come  on,  sisters  !  I  will  be 
the  first  to  strike  the  wild  boar. ' '  The  whole  band  rushed  upon 
him,  and  while  he  now  talks  less  arrogantly,  now  excuses  him- 
self, and  now  confesses  his  crime  and  implores  pardon,  they' 
press  upon  and  wound  him.  In  vain  he  cries  to  his  aunts  to 
protect  him  from  his  mother.  Autonoe  seized  one  arm,  Ino 
the  other,  and  between  them  he  was  torn  to  pieces,  while  his 
mother  shouted,  "Victory!  Victory!  we  have  done  it  I  the 
glory  is  ours  1"  So  the  worship  of  Bacchus  was  established  ii>

carry  him  to  when  they  so  treacherously  attempted  to  make 
prize  of  him.  As  Ariadne  sat  lamenting  her  fate,  Bacchus

The  Rural  Deities. 

Pan,  the  god  of  woods  and  fields,  of  flocks  and  shepherds, 
dwelt  in  grottos,  wandered  on  the  mountains  and  in  valleys,  and 
amused  himself  with  the  chase  or  in 
leading  the  dances  of  the  nymphs. 

•*  From  the  forests  and  highlands 

We  come,  we  come  } 
From  the  river-girt  islands. 

Where  loud  waves  are  dumb." 

— Shelley. 

He  was  fond  of  music,  and,  as  we 
have  seen,  the  inventor  of  the  syrinx, 
or  shepherd's  pipe,  which  he  him- 
self played  in  a  masterly  manner. 
Pan,  like  other  gods  who  dwelt  in 
forests,  was  dreaded  by  those  whose 
occupations  caused  them  to  pass 
through  the  woods  by  night,  for  the 
gloom  and  loneliness  of  such  scenes 
dispose  the  mind  to  superstitious 
fears.  Hence  sudden  fright  without 
any  visible  cause  was  ascribed  to  Pan, 

and  called  a  Panic  terror.     He  was  chief  of  the  Satyrs,  and  is  so 
represented  in  art.

Pan. 


2It 


STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 


As  the  name  of  the  god  signifies  a//,  Pan  came  to  be  consid- 
ered a  symbol  of  the  universe  and  personification  of  Nature,  and 
later  still  to  be  regarded  as  a  representative  of  all  the  gods,  and 
of  heathenism  itself. 

Sylvanus  and  Faunus  were  Latin  divinities,  whose  character- 
istics are  so  nearly  the  same  as  those  of  Pan  that  we  may  safely 
consider  them  as  the  same  personage  under  different  names. 

The  wood-nymphs.  Pan's  partners  in  the  dance,  were  but  ono 
class  of  nymphs. 

*♦  Universal  Pan, 
Knit  with  the  Graces  and  the  Hours  in  dance. 
Led  on  the  eternal  spring." — Milton, 

There  were  beside  them  the  Naiades,  who  presided  over  brooks 

and  fountains,  the  Oreades, 
nymphs  of  mountains  and 
grottos,  and  the  Nereides, 
sea-nymphs.  The  three  last 
named  were  immortal,  but 
the  wood-nymphs,  called 
Dryades  or  Hamadryades, 
were  believed  to  perish  with 
the  trees  which  had  been 
their  abode,  and  with  which 
they  had  come  into  exist- 
ence. It  was  therefore  an 
impious  act  wantonly  to 
destroy  a  tree,  and  in  some 
aggravated  cases  was  se-. 
verely  punished,  as  in  the  in- 
stance of  Er-i-sich'thon, 
which  we  are  about  to  re- 
cord. 

It  was  a  pleasing  trait  in 
the  old  Paganism  that  it 
loved  to  trace  m  every  oper  • 
ation  of  nature  the  agency 
of  deity.  The  imagination 
of  the  Greeks  peopled  all 
\he  regions  of  earth  and  sea  with  divinities,  to  whose  agency  it

attributed  those  phenomena  which  our  philosophy  ascribes  to 
the  operation  of  the  laws  of  nature.  Sometimes,  in  our  poeti- 
cal moods,  we  feel  disposed  to  regret  the  change,  and  to  think 
that  the  neart  has  lost  as  much  as  the  head  has  gained  by  the 
substitution.  The  poet  Wordsworth  thus  strongly  expresses 
this  sentiment : — • 

"  Great  God,  I'd  rather  be 
A  Pagan,  suckled  in  a  creed  outworn, 
So  might  I,  standing  on  this  pleasant  lea. 
Have  glimpses  that  would  make  me  less  forlorn  \ 
Have  sight  of  Proteus  rising  from  the  sea,  ,  , 

And  hear  old  Triton  blow  his  wreathed  horn." 

Schiller,  in  his  poem  Die  Gotter  Griechenlands,  expresses  his 
regret  for  the  overthrow  of  the  beautiful  mythology  of  ancient 
times  in  a  way  which  has  called  forth  an  answer  from  a  Christian 
poet,  Mrs.  E.  Barrett  Browning,  in  her  poem  called  "The  Dead 
Pan.**     The  two  following  verses  are  a  specimen  : — 


(< 


By  your  beauty  which  confesses 
Some  chief  Beauty  conquering  you. 
By  our  grand  heroic  guesses 
Through  your  falsehood  at  the  True, 
We  will  weep  not !  earth  shall  roll 
Heir  to  each  god's  aureole, 

And  Pan  is  dead. 


**  Earth  outgrows  the  mythic  fancies 
Sung  beside  her  in  her  youth  ; 
And  those  debonair  romances 
Sound  but  dull  beside  the  truth. 
Phoebus'  chariot  course  is  run  I 
Look  up,  poets,  to  the  sun  ! 

Pan,  Pan  is  dead." 


These  lines  are  founded  on  an  early  Christian  tradition  that 
when  the  heavenly  host  told  the  shepherds  at  Bethlehem  of  the 
birth  of  Christ,  a  deep  groan,  heard  through  all  the  isles  of 
Greece,  told  that  the  great  Pan  was  dead,  and  that  all  the  royalty 
of  Olympus  was  dethroned,  and  the  several  deities  were  sent 
wandering  in  cold  and  darkness.  So  Milton,  in  his  **  Hymn  tu 
the  Nativity  ":—

STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES. 


**  The  lonely  mountains  o'er. 
And  the  resounding  shore, 

A  voice  of  weeping  heard  and  loud  lament ; 
From  haunted  spring  and  dale, 
Edged  with  poplar  pale. 

The  parting  Genius  is  with  sighing  sent ; 
With  flower-enwoven  tresses  torn, 
The  nymphs  in  twilight  shade  of  tangled  thickets  mourn," 


Er-i-sich'thon. 

Er-i-sich'thon  was  a  profane  person  and  a  despiser  of  the 
gods.     On  one  occasion  he  presumed  to  violate  with  the  axe  a 

grove  scared  to 
Ceres.  There 
stood  in  this 
grove  a  venera- 
ble oak,  so  large 
that  it  seemed  a 
wood  in  itself, 
its  ancient  trunk 
towering  aloft, 
whereon  votive 
garlands  were 
often  hung  and 


inscriptions 
carved  express- 
ing the  gratitude 
of  suppliants  to 
the  nymph  of 
the  tree.  Often 
had  the  Dryades 
danced  round 
it  hand  in  hand. 
Its  trunk  meas- 
ured fifteen  cu- 
bits round,  and 
it      overtopped 

the  other  trees  as  they  overtopped  the  shrubbery.  But  for  all 
that,  Erisichthon  saw  no  reason  why  he  should  spare  it,  and 
he  ordered  his  servants  to  cut  it  down.     When  he  saw  them

ERISICHTHON.  21$ 

hesitate,  he  snatched  an  axe  from  one,  and  thus  impiously  ex- 
claimed :  "  I  care  not  whether  it  be  a  tree  beloved  of  the  goddess 
or  not ;  were  it  the  goddess  herself  it  should  come  down,  if 
it  stood  in  my  way."  So  saying,  he  lifted  the  axe,  and  the  oak 
seemed  to  shudder  and  utter  a  groan.  When  the  first  blow  fell 
upon  the  trunk,  blood  flowed  from  the  wound.  All  the  by» 
standers  were  horror-struck,  and  one  of  them  ventured  to  remon- 
strate and  hold  back  the  fatal  axe.  Erisichthon,  with  a  scornful 
look,  said  to  him,  '*  Receive  the  reward  of  your  piety,"  and 
turned  against  him  the  weapon  which  he  had  held  aside  from  the 
tree,  gashed  his  body  with  many  wounds,  and  cut  off  his  head. 
Then  from  the  midst  of  the  oak  came  a  voice  ;  **  I  who  dwell  in 
this  tree  am  a  nymph  beloved  by  Ceres,  and,  dying  by  your  hands, 
forewarn  you  that  punishment  awaits  you."  He  desisted  not 
from  his  crime  ;  and  at  last  the  tree,  sundered  by  repeated  blows 
and  drawn  by  ropes,  fell  with  a  crash,  and  prostrated  a  great  part 
of  the  grove  in  its  fall. 

The  Dryades,  in  dismay  at  the  loss  of  their  companion,  and  at 
seeing  the  pride  of  the  forest  laid  low,  went  in  a  body  to  Ceres, 
all  clad  in  garments  of  mourning,  and  invoked  punishment  upon 
Erisichthon.  She  nodded  her  assent,  and  as  she  bowed  her  head 
the  grain,  ripe  for  harvest  in  the  laden  fields,  bowed  also.  She 
planned  a  punishment  so  dire  that  one  would  pity  him,  if  such  a 
culprit  as  he  could  be  pitied — to  deliver  him  over  to  Famine. 
As  Ceres  herself  could  not  approach  Famine,  for  the  Fates  have 
ordained  that  these  two  goddesses  shall  never  come  together,  she 
called  on  Oread  from  her  mountain  and  spoke  to  her  in  these 
words  :  **  There  is  a  place  in  the  farthest  part  of  ice-clad  Scythia, 
a  sad  and  sterile  region  without  trees  and  without  crops.  Cold 
dwells  there,  and  Fear,  and  Shuddering,  and  Famine.  Go  and 
tell  the  last  to  take  possession  of  the  bowels  of  Erisichthon.  Let 
not  abundance  subdue  her,  nor  the  power  of  my  gifts  drive  her 
away.  Be  not  alarmed  at  the  distance,  for  Famine  dwells  very 
far  from  Ceres,  but  take  my  chariot.  The  dragons  are  fleet  and 
obey  the  rein,  and  will  take  you  through  the  air  in  a  short 
time."  So  she  gave  her  the  reins,  and  she  dro 'c  away  and 
soon  reached  Scythia.  On  arriving  at  Mount  Caucasus  she 
stopped  the  dragons  and  found  Famine  in  a  stony  field,  pulling 
up  with  teeth  and  claws  the  scanty  herbage.    Her  hair  was  rough,

iier  eyes  sunk,  her  face  pale,  her  lips  blanched,  her  jaws  covered 
with  dust,  and  her  skin  drawn  tight,  so  as  to  show  all  her  bones. 
As  the  Oread  saw  her  afar  off  (for  she  did  not  dare  to  come 
near),  she  delivered  the  commands  of  Ceres;  and  though  she 
stopped  as  short  a  time  as  possible,  and  kept  her  distance  as  well 
as  she  could,  yet  she  began  to  feel  hungry,  and  turned  the 
dragons'  heads  and  drove  back  to  Thessaly. 

Famine  obeyed  the  commands  of  Ceres  and  sped  through 
the  air  to  the  dwelling  of  Erisichthon,  entered  the  bedchambei 
of  the  guilty  man,  and  found  him  asleep.  She  enfolded  him 
with  her  wings  and  breathed  herself  into  him,  infusing  her  poison 
into  his  veins.  Having  discharged  her  task,  she  hastened  to 
leave  the  land  of  plenty  and  returned  to  her  accustomed  haunts. 
Erisichthon  still  slept,  and  in  his  dreams  craved  food,  and  moved 
his  jaws  as  if  eating.  When  he  awoke  his  hunger  was  raging. 
Without  a  moment's  delay  he  would  have  food  set  before  him, 
of  whatever  kind  earth,  sea  or  air  produces,  and  complained 
of  hunger  even  while  he  ate.  What  would  have  sufficed  for  a 
city  or  a  nation  was  not  enough  for  him.  The  more  he  ate  the 
more  he  craved. 

His  property  rapidly  diminished  under  the  unceasing  demands 
of  his  appetite,  but  his  hunger  continued  unabated.  At  length 
he  had  spent  all,  and  had  only  his  daughter  left,  a  daughter 
worthy  of  a  better  parent.  Her  too  he  sold.  She  scorned  to 
be  the  slave  of  a  purchaser,  and,  as  she  stood  by  the  seaside, 
raised  her  hands  in  prayer  to  Neptune.  He  heard  her  prayer, 
and,  though  her  new  master  was  not* far  off,  and  had  his  eyes 
upon  her  a  moment  before,  Neptune  changed  her  form,  and 
made  her  assume  that  of  a  fisherman  busy  at  his  occupation. 
Her  master,  looking  for  her  and  seeing  her  in  her  altered  form, 
addressed  her  and  said  :  '*  Good  fisherman,  whither  went  the 
maiden  whom  I  saw  just  now,  with  hair  dishevelled  and  in 
humble  garb,  standing  about  where  you  stand?  Tell  me  truly, 
so  may  your  luck  be  good,  and  not  a  fish  nibble  at  your  hook 
and  get  away."  She  perceived  that  her  prayer  was  answered, 
and  rejoiced  inwardly  at  hearing  herself  inquired  of  about  her- 
Belf.  She  replied,  **  Pardon  me,  stranger,  but  I  have  been  so 
intent  upon  my  line  that  I  have  seen  nothing  else  ;  but  I  wish 
I  may  never  catch  another  fish  if  I  believe  any  woman  or  other

person  except  myself  to  have  been  hereabouts  for  some  time." 
He  was  deceived  and  went  his  way,  thinking  his  slave  had  es- 
caped. Then  she  resumed  her  own  form.  Her  father  was 
well  pleased  to  find  her  still  with  him,  and  the  money,  too,  that 
he  got  by  the  sale  of  her ;  so  he  sold  her  again.  But  she  was 
changed  by  the  favor  of  Neptune  as  often  as  she  was  sold, — now 
into  a  horse,  now  a  bird,  now  an  ox,  and  now  a  stag, — got  away 
from  her  purchasers,  and  came  home.  By  this  base  method  the 
starving  father  procured  food,  but  not  enough  for  his  wants ; 
and  at  last  hunger  compelled  him  to  devour  his  limbs,  and  he

strove  to  nourish  himself  by  eating  his  body,  till  death  relieved 
him  from  the  vengeance  of  Ceres. 

'  RhcE'cus. 

The  Hamadryades  could  appreciate  services  as  well  as  punish 
injuries.  The  story  of  Rhoe'cus  proves  this.  Rhoecus,  hap- 
pening to  see  an  oak  just  ready  to  fall,  ordered  his  servants  to 
prop  it  up.  The  nymph,  who  had  been  on  the  point  of  perish- 
ing with  the  tree,  came  and  expressed  her  gratitude  to  him  foi 
having  saved  her  life,  and  bade  him  ask  what  reward  he  would. 
Rhoecus  boldly  asked  her  love,  and  the  nymph  yielded  to  his  de*

him  that  a  bee  should  be  her  messenger,  and  let  him  know  when 
she  would  admit  his  society.  One  time  the  bee  came  to  Rhcecus 
while  he  was  playing  at  draughts,  and  he  carelessly  brushed  it 
away.  This  so  incensed  the  nymph  that  she  deprived  him  of  sight.

tans and  assumed  their  power,  Neptune  and  Amphitrite  suc- 
ceeded to  the  dominion  of  the  waters  in  place  of  Oceanus  and 
Tethys. 

Nep'tune. 

Nep'tune  was  the  chief  of  the  water  deities.  The  symbol 
of  his  power  was  the  trident,  or  spear  with  three  points,  with 
which  he  used  to  shatter  rocks,  to  call  forth  or  subdue  storms,  to 
shake  the  shores,  and  the  like. 

**  Hail,  Neptune,  greatest  of  the  gods! 
Thou  ruler  of  the  salt  sea  floods  ; 
Thou  with  the  deep  and  dark-green  hair, 
That  dost  the  golden  trident  bear." — Arion. 

He  created  the  horse  and  was  the  patron  of  horse-races.  His 
own  horses  had  brazen  hoofs  and  golden  manes.  They  drew  his 
chariot  over  the  sea,  which  became  smooth  before  him,  while  the 
monsters  of  the  deep  gambolled  about  his  path. 

Am-phi-tri'te. 
Am-phi-tri'te  was  the  wife  of  Neptune.     She  was  the  daughter 
of  Nereus  and  Doris,  and  the  mother  of  Triton.     Neptune,  to 
pay  his  court  to  Amphitrite,  came  riding  on  a  dolphin. 

**  O'er  the  green  waves  which  gently  bend  and  swell, 
Fair  Amphiciite  steers  her  silver  shell  ; 
Her  playful  dolphins  stretch  the  silken  rein, 
Hear  her  sweet  voice,  and  glide  along  the  main."  — -Darwin

Having  won  her,  he  rewarded  the  dolphin  by  placing  him 
Among  the  stars. 

Ne're-us  and   Do'ris. 

Ne're-us  and  Do'ris  w^ere  the  parents  of  the  Nereides,  the 
most  celebrated  of  whom  were  Amphitrite,  Thetis,  the  mother 
of  Achilles,  and  Galatea,  who  was  loved  by  the  Cyclops  Poly- 
phemus. Nereus  was  distinguished  for  his  knowledge  and  his 
love  of  truth  and  justice,  whence  he  was  termed  an  elder ;  the 
gift  of  prophecy  was  also  assigned  to  him. 

Tri'ton  and  Pro'teus, 

Tri'ton  was  the  son  of  Neptune  and  Amphitrite,  and  the  poets 
make  him  his  father's  trumpeter.  Pro'teus  was  also  a  son  of 
Neptune.  He,  like  Nereus,  is  styled  a  sea-elder  for  his  wisdom 
and  knowledge  of  future  events.  His  peculiar  power  was  that 
of  changing  his  shape  at  will. 

**  Shouting  we  seize  the  god  :  our  force  t'  evade, 
His  various  arts  he  soon  resumes  in  aid  : 
A  lion  now,  he  curls  a  surgy  mane  ; 
Sudden,  our  hands  a  spotted  pard  restrain  ; 
And  last,  sublime,  his  stately  growth  he  rears, 
A  tree,  and  well-dissembled  foliage  wears." 

— Homer  (Pope's  tr.). 

The'tis. 

The'tis,  the  daughter  of  Nereus  and  Doris,  was  so  beautiful  that 
Jupiter  himself  sought  her  in  marriage ;  but  having  learned  from 
Prometheus,  the  Titan,  that  Thetis  should  bear  a  son  who  should 
be  greater  than  his  father,  Jupiter  desisted  from  his  suit  and  de- 
creed that  Thetis  should  be  the  wife  of  a  mortal.  By  the  aid  of 
Chiron,  the  Centaur,  Peleus  succeeded  in  winning  the  goddess 
for  his  bride,  and  their  son  was  the  renowned  Achilles.  In  our 
chapter  on  the  Trojan  war  it  will  appear  that  Thetis  was  a  faith- 
ful mother  to  him,  aiding  him  in  all  difficulties,  and  watching 
over  his  interests  from  the  first  to  the  last. 

Leu-co'the-a  and  Pa-lse'mon. 

Ino,  the  daughter  of  Cadmus  and  wife  of  Athamas,  flying  from 
her  frantic  husband  with  her  little  son  Melicertes  in  her  arms,

sprang  from  a  ciiff  into  the  sea.  The  gods,  out  of  compassion, 
made  her  a  goddess  of  the  sea,  under  the  name  of  Leu-co'the-a, 
and  him  a  god  under  that  of  Pa-lse'mon.  Both  were  held 
powerful  to  save  from  shipwreck  and  were  invoked  by  sailors. 
Palsemon  was  usually  represented  riding  on  a  dolphin.  The 
Isthmian  games  were  celebrated  in  his  honor.  He  was  called 
Portunus  by  the  Romans,  and  believed  to  have  jurisdiction  of  the 
ports  and  shores.

The  Ca-me'nae. 

By  this  name  the  Latins  designated  the  Muses,  but  included 
under  it  also  some  other  deities,  principally  nymphs  of  fountains. 
Egeria  was  one  of  them,  whose  fountain  and  grotto  are  still  shown. 

**  Here  didst  thou  dwell,  in  this  enchanted  cover, 
Egeria!"  — Byron. 

It  was  said  that  Numa,  the  second  king  of  Rome,  was  favored 
by  this  nymph  with  secret  interviews,  in  which  she  taught  him 
those  lessons  of  wisdom  and  of  law  which  he  embodied  in  the  in- 
stitutions of  his  rising  nation.  After  the  death  of  Numa  the 
nymph  pined  away  and  was  changed  into  a  fountain. 

The  Winds. 

When  so  many  less  active  agencies  were  personified,  it  is  not 
to  be  supposed  that  the  winds  failed  to  be  so.  They  were  Bo'- 
re-as  or  Aq'ui-lo,  the  north  wind  ;  Zeph'y-rus  or  Fa-vo'- 
nius,  the  west;  No'tus  or  Aus'ter,  the  south,  and  Eu'rus,

the  east.  The  first  two  have  been  chiefly  celebrated  hy  the 
poets,  the  former  as  the  type 
of  rudeness,  the  latter  of  gen- 
tleness. Boreas  loved  the 
nymph  Or-i-thy'i-a,  and 
Iried  to  play  the  lover's  part, 
but  met  with  poor  success. 
It  was  hard  for  him  to  breathe 
gently,  and  sighing  was  out 
of  the  question.  Weary  at 
last  of  fruitless  endeavors, 
he  acted  out  his  true  char- 
acter, seized  the  maiden,  and 
carried  her  off.  Their  chil- 
dren were  Ze'tes  and  Cal'- 
a-is,  winged  warriors,  who 
accompanied  the  Argonautic 
expedition,  and  did  good 
service  in  an  encounter  with 
those  monstrous  birds,  the 
Harpies. 

Zephyrus  was  the  lover  of 
Flora.  Milton  alludes  to 
them  in  '  *  Paradise  -  Lost, ' ' 
where  he  describes  Adam 
waking    and    contemplating 

Eve,  still  asleep  : — 

* '  Then  with  voice 
Mild  as  when  Zephyrus  on  Flora  breathes, 
Her  hand  soft  touching,  whispered  thus  :  '  Awake  I 
My  fairest,  my  espoused,  my  latest  found, 
Heaven's  last,  best  gift,  my  ever-new  delight.'  '* 

The  character  and  appearance  ascribed  to  each  of  these  deities 
was,  as  usual,  in  Greek  mythology,  such  as  was  suggested  by  the 
phenomena  of  each  wind — as,  for  example,  the  strength  and  fury 
of  the  north  wind,  or  the  genial  warmth  of  the  south-west.  Some 
were  thought  to  be  male,  some  female,  and  all  winged.  Eurus, 
who  brought  warmth  and  rain  from  the  eait,  was  represented 
holding  a  vase  inverted,  as  if  pouring  rain  from  it,     Lips,  who

was  lightly  clad,  and  carried  a  quantity  of  flowers  in  his  scarf. 
A-pe'li-o'tes,  the  south-west  wind,  carried  fruits  of  many  kinds, 
wore  boots,  and  was  not  so  lightly  clad  as  the  last  mentioned. 
So  they  were  represented  on  the  **  Tower  of  the  Winds"  at 
Athens.*

CHAPTER  XXIII. 

Ach-e-lo'us  and  Her'cu-les — Ad-me'tus  and  Al-ces'tis 
— An-tig'o-ne — Pe-nero-pe. 

Ach-e-lo'us  and  Her'cu-les. 

The  river-god  Ach-e-lo'us  told  the  story  of  Erisichthon  to 
Theseus  and  his  companions,  whom  he  was  entertaining  at  his 
hospitable  board,  while  they  were  delayed  on  their  journey  by 
the  overflow  of  his  waters.  Having  finished  his  story  he  added-, 
**  But  why  should  I  tell  of  other  persons'  transformations,  when 
I  myself  am  an  instance  of  the  possession  of  this  power?  Some- 
times I  become  a  serpent,  and  sometimes  a  bull,  with  horns  on 
my  head.  Or  I  should  say,  I  once  could  do  so ;  but  now  I 
have  but  one  horn,  having  lost  one."  And  here  he  groane4 
and  was  silent. 

Theseus  asked  him  the  cause  of  his  grief,  and  how  he  lost  his 
horn.  To  which  question  the  river-god  replied  as  follows : 
*'Who  likes  to  tell  of  his  defeats?  Yet  I  will  not  hesitate  to 
relate  mine,  comforting  myself  with  the  thought  of  the  great- 
ness of  my  conqueror,  for  it  was  Her'cu-les.  Perhaps  you  have 
heard  of  the  fame  of  Dejanira,  the  fairest  of  maidens,  whom  a 
host  of  suitors  strove  to  win.  Hercules  and  myself  were  cS  the 
number,  and  the  rest  yielded  to  us  two.  He  urged  in  his  behalf 
his  descent  from  Jove,  and  his  labors  by  which  he  had  exceeded 
the  exactions  of  Juno,  his  step-mother.  I,  on  the  other  hand, 
said  to  the  father  of  the  maiden,  *  Behold  me,  the  king  of  the 
waters  that  flow  through  your  land. 

**Achelous  came 
The  river-god  to  ask  a  father's  voice." — SOPHOCI.ES. 

"  *  I  am  no  stranger  from  a  foreign  shore,  but  belong  to  the 
country,  a  part  of  your  realm.  Let  it  not  stand  in  my  way  that 
royal  Juno  owes  me  no  enmity,  nor  punishes  me  with  heavy 
tasks.  As  for  this  man  who  boasts  himself  the  son  of  Jove,  it 
is  either  a  false  pretence  or  disgraceful  to  him  if  true,  for  it  can* 


ACHELOUS  AND  HERCULES.  223 

not  be  true  except  by  his  mother's  shame.'  As  I  said  this 
Hercules  scowled  upon  me,  and  with  difficulty  restrained  his 
rage.  *  My  hand  will  answer  better  than  my  tongue,'  said  he. 
*  I  yield  you  the  victory  in  words,  but  trust  my  cause  to  the 
strife  of  deeds.'  With  that  he  advanced  towards  me,  and  I  was 
ashamed,  after  what  I  had  said,  to  yield.  I  threw  off  my  green 
vesture,  and  presented  myself  for  the  struggle.  He  tried  to 
throw  me,  now  attacking  my  head,  now  my  body.  My  bulk 
was  my  protection,  and  he  assailed  me  in  vain.  For  a  time  we 
stopped,  then  returned  to  the  conflict. 

**  Warm,  and  more  warm  the  conflict  grows : 
Dire  was  the  noise  of  rattling  bows." — SoPHOCLES  (Francklin's  tr.). 

'*We  each  kept  our  position,  determined  not  to  yield,  foot  to 
foot,  I  bending  over  him,  clinching  his  hands  in  mine,  with  my 
forehead  almost  touching  his.  Thrice  Hercules  tried  to  throw 
me  off,  and  the  fourth  time  he  succeeded,  brought  me  to  the 
ground  and  himself  upon  my  back.  I  tell  you  the  truth,  it  was 
as  if  a  mountain  had  fallen  on  me.  I  struggled  to  get  my  arms 
at  liberty,  panting  and  reeking  with  perspiration.  He  gave  me 
no  chance  to  recover,  but  seized  my  throat.  My  knees  were  on 
the  earth  and  my  mouth  in  the  dust. 

**  Finding  that  I  was  no  match  for  him  in  the  warrior's  art,  I 
resorted  to  others,  and  glided  away  in  the  form  of  a  serpent.  I 
curled  my  body  in  a  coil,  and  hissed  at  him  with  my  forked 
tongue.  He  smiled  scornfully  at  this,  and  said,  'It  was  the 
labor  of  my  infancy  to  conquer  snakes. '  So  saying,  he  clasped 
my  neck  with  his  hands.  I  was  almost  choked,  and  struggled 
to  get  my  neck  out  of  his  grasp.  Vanquished  in  this  form,  I 
tried  what  alone  remained  to  me,  and  assumed  the  form  of  a 
bull.  He  grasped  my  neck  with  his  arm,  and  dragging  my  head 
down  to  the  ground,  overthrew  me  on  the  sand.  Nor  was  this 
enough.  His  ruthless  hand  rent  my  horn  from  my  head.  The 
Naiades  took  it,  consecrated  it,  and  filled  it  with  fragrant  flow- 
ers. Plenty  adopted  my  horn  and  made  it  her  own,  and  called 
it  Cornucopia." 

The  ancients  were  fond  of  finding  a  hidden  meaning  in  their 
mythological  tales.  They  explain  this  fight  of  Achelous  with  Her- 
cules by  saying  Achelous  was  a  river  that  in  seasons  of  rain  over- 


226 


STORIES  OF  OODS  AND  HEROES. 


flowed  its  banks.  When  the  fable  says  that  Achelous  loved  De« 
janira,  and  sought  a  union  with  her,  the  meaning  is  that  the  rivet 
in  its  windings  flowed  through  part  of  Dejanira's  kingdom.  It 
was  said  to  take  the  form  of  a  snake  because  of  its  winding,  and 
of  a  bull  because  it  made  a  brawling  or  roaring  in  its  course. 

When  the  river  swelled,  it  made 
itself  another  channel.  Thus 
its  head  was  horned.  Hercules 
prevented  the  return  of  these 
periodical  overflows  by  embank- 
ments and  canals,  and  therefore 
he  was  said  to  have  vanquished 
the  river-god  and  cut  off"  his 
horn.  Finally,  the  lands  for- 
merly subject  to  overflow,  but 
now  redeemed,  became  very  fer- 
tile, and  this  is  meant  by  the 
horn  of  plenty. 

There  is  another  account  of 
the  origin  of  the  Cornucopia. 
Jupiter  at  his  birth  was  com- 
mitted by  his  mother  Rhea  to 
the  care  of  the  daughters  of 
Melisseus,  a  Cretan  king.  They 
fed  the  infant  deity  with  the 
milk  of  the  goat  Amalthea. 
Jupiter  broke  off*  one  of  the 
horns  of  the  goat  and  gave  it 
to  his  nurses,  and  endowed  it 
with  the  wonderful  power  of 
becoming  filled  with  whatever 
the  possessor  might  wish. 
The  name  of  Amalthea  is  also  given  by  some  writers  to  tha 
mother  of  Bacchus.     It  is  thus  used  by  Milton  : — 

*'  That  Nyseian  isle, 
Girt  with  the  river  Triton,  where  old  Cham, 
Whom  Gentiles  Ammon  call,  and  Libyan  Jove, 
Hid  Amalthea  and  her  florid  son, 
Young  Bacchus,  from  his  stepdame  Rhea'«  eye."

^sculapius,  the  son  of  Apollo,  was  endowed  by  his  father 
with  such  skill  in  the  healing  art  that  he  even  restored  the  dead 
to  life.  At  this  Pluto  took  alarm,  and  prevailed  on  Jupiter  to 
launch  a  thunderbolt  at  -^sculapius.  Apollo  was  indignant  at 
the  destruction  of  his  son,  and  wreaked  his  vengeance  on  the  inno- 
cent workmen  who  had  made  the  thunderbolt.  These  were  the 
Cyclopes,  who  have  their  workshop  under  Mount  ^tna,  fr  ■)m 
which  the  smoke  and  flames  of  their  furnaces  are  constantly  is- 
suing. Apollo  shot  his  arrows  at  the  Cyclopes,  which  so  in- 
censed Jupiter  that  he  condemned  him  as  a  punishment  to  be- 
come the  servant  of  a  mortal  for  the  space  of  one  year.  Accord- 
ingly Apollo  went  into  the  service  of  Ad-me'tus,  king  of 
Thessaly,  and  pastured  his  flocks  for  him  on  the  verdant  banks 
of  the  river  Amphrysos. 

"  There  came  a  youth  upon  the  earth 
Some  thousand  years  ago, 
Whose  slender  hands  were  nothing  worth 
Whether  to  plow,  or  reap,  or  sow. 

**  Upon  an  empty  tortoise-shell 

He  stretched  some  chords,  and  drew 
Music,  that  made  men's  bosoms  swell 

Fearless,  or  brimmed  their  eyes  with  dew." — LoWELL. 

Admetus  was  a  suitor,  with  others,  for  the  hand  of  Al-ces'tis, 
the  daughter  of  Pelias,  who  promised  her  to  him  who  should 
come  for  her  in  a  chariot  drawn  by  lions  and  boars.  This  task 
Admetus  performed  by  the  assistance  of  his  divine  herdsman, 
and  was  made  happy  in  the  possession  of  Alcestis.  But  Ad- 
metus fell  ill,  and  being  near  to  death,  Apollo  prevailed  on  the 
Fates  to  spare  him  on  condition  that  some  one  would  consent  to 
die  in  his  stead.  Admetus,  in  his  joy  at  this  reprieve,  thought 
little  of  the  ransom,  and  perhaps,  remembering  the  declarations 
of  attachment  which  he  had  often  heard  from  his  courtiers  and 
dependents,  fancied  that  it  would  be  easy  to  find  a  substitute. 
But  it  was  not  so.  Brave  warriors,  who  would  willingly  have 
perilled  their  lives  for  their  prince,  shrunk  from  the  thought  of 
dying  for  him  on  the  bed  of  sickness ;  and  old  servants  who 
had  experienced  his  bounty  and  that  of  his  house  from  theii

childhood  up,  were  not  willing  to  lay  down  the  scanty  remnant 
of  their  days  to  show  their  gratitude.  Men  asked, — ''Why 
does  not  one  of  his  parents  do  it  ?  They  cannot  in  the  course 
of  nature  live  much  longer,  and  who  can  feel  like  them  the  call  to 
rescue  the  life  they  gave,  from  an  untimely  end?"  But  the  pa- 
rents, distressed  though  they  were  at  the  thought  of  losing  him, 
shrunk  from  the  call.  Then  Alcestis,  with  a  generous  self-devo- 
tion, proffered  herself  as  the  substitute.  \ 

"He  canvassed  every  friend,  his  hoary  sire,  , 

The  aged  mother,  too,  that  gave  him  birth  ; 
None  but  his  wife  he  found." — Euripides  (Woodhull). 

Admetus,  fond  as  he  was  of  life,  would  not  have  submitted  to 
receive  it  at  such  a  cost ;  but  there  was  no  remedy.  The  condi- 
tion imposed  by  the  Fates  had  been  met,  and  the  decree  was  ir- 
revocable. Alcestis  sickened  as  Admetus  revived,  and  she  was 
rapidly  sinking  to  the  grave. 

Just  at  this  time  Hercules  arrived  at  the  palace  of  Admetus, 
and  found  all  the  inmates  in  great  distress  for  the  impending  loss 
of  the  devoted  wife  and  beloved  mistress.  Hercules,  to  whom 
no  labor  was  too  arduous,  resolved  to  attempt  her  rescue.  He 
went  and  lay  in  wait  at  the  door  of  the  chamber  of  the  dying 
queen,  and  when  Death  came  for  his  prey  he  seized  him  and 
forced  him  to  resign  his  victim. 

*'  Did  not  Hercules  by  force 
Wrest  from  the  guardian  monster  of  the  tomb 
Alcestis,  a  reanimated  corse, 
Given  back  to  dwell  on  earth  in  vernal  bloom  ?" 

— Wordsworth. 

Alcestis  recovered,  and  was  restored  to  her  husband.      Milton 

alludes  to  the  story  of  Alcestis  in  his  sonnet  "  On  His  Deceased 

Wife":— 

"  Methought  I  saw  my  late  espoused  saint 

Brought  to  me  like  Alcestis  from  the  grave, 
Whom  Jove's  great  son  to  her  glad  husband  gave, 
Rescued  from  Death  by  force,  though  pale  and  faint.'*

victims  of  an  unrelenting  fate,  dooming  them  to  destruction.

CEdipus,  in  his  madness,  had  torn  out  his  eyes,  and  was  driven 
forth  from  his  kingdom  Thebes,  dreaded  and  abandoned  by  all 
men,  as  an  object  of  divine  vengeance.  Antigone,  his  daughter, 
alone  shared  his  wanderings  and  remained  with  him  till  he  died, 
and  then  returned  to  Thebes. 

Her  brothers,  Eteocles  and  Polynices,  had  agreed  to  share  the 
kingdom  between  them,  and  reign  alternately  year  by  year. 
The  first  year  fell  to  the  lot  of  Eteocles,  who,  when  his  time  ex- 
pired, refused  to  surrender  the  kingdom  to  his  brother.  Poly- 
nices fled  to  iVdrastus,  king  of  Argos,  who  gave  him  his  daughter 
in  marriage,  and  aided  him  with  an  army  to  enforce  his  claim 
to  the  kingdom.  This  led  to  the  celebrated  expedition  of  the 
**  Seven  against  Thebes,"  which  furnished  ample  materials  for 
the  epic  and  tragic  poets  of  Greece. 

Amphiaraus,  the  brother-in-law  of  Adrastus,  opposed  the  en- 
terprise, for  he  was  a  soothsayer,  and  knew  by  his  art  that  no 
one  of  the  leaders  except  Adrastus  would  live  to  return.  But 
Amphiaraus,  on  his  marriage  to  Eriphyle,  the  king's  sister,  had 
agreed  that  whenever  he  and  Adrastus  should  differ  in  opinion, 
the  decision  should  be  left  to  Eriphyle.  Polynices,  knowing 
this,  gave  Eriphyle  the  collar  of  Harmonia,  and  thereby  gained 
her  to  his  interest.  This  collar  or  necklace  was  a  present  which 
Vulcan  had  given  to  Harmonia  on  her  marriage  with  Cadmus, 
and  Polynices  had  taken  it  with  him  on  his  flight  from  Thebes. 
Eriphyle  could  not  resist  so  tempting  a  bribe,  and  by  her  decision 
the  war  was  resolved  on,  and  Amphiaraus  went  to  his  certain  fate. 

*'  'Twas  Polynices  that  caused 
Thy  sire  and  me  to  perish  when  he  brought 
That  golden  necklace  to  the  Argive  land."  —  EuRiPiDES. 

He  bore  his  part  bravely  in  the  contest,  but  could  not  avert 
his  destiny.  Pursued  by  the  enemy  he  fled  along  the  river, 
when  a  thunderbolt  launched  by  Jupiter  opened  the  ground, 
and  he,  his  chariot  and  his  charioteer  were  swallowed  up. 

It  would  not  be  in  place  here  to  detail  all  the  acts  of  heroism 
or  atrocity  which  marked  the  contest ;  but  we  must  not  omit 
to  record  the  fidelity  of  Evadne  as  an  offset  to  the  weakness  of 
Eriphyle.  Capaneus,  the  husband  of  Evadne,  in  the  ardor  of  the 
fight  declared  that  he  would  force  his  way  into  the  city  in  spit^

of  Jove  himself.  Placing  a  ladder  against  the  wall,  he  mounted  ; 
but  Jupiter,  offended  at  his  impious  language,  struck  him  with  a 
thunderbolt.  When  his  obsequies  were  celebrated,  Evadne  cast 
herself  on  his  funeral  pile  and  perished. 

**  Already  have  I  taken 
The  fatal  leap,  and  hence  descend,  with  joy, 
Though  not  indeed  to  you,  yet  to  myself 
And  to  my  lord,  with  whose  remains  I  bum." 

T/ie  Suppliants  (EuRIPIDES.) 

Early  in  the  contest  Eteocles  consulted  the  soothsayer  Tiresias 
as  to  the  cause.  Tiresias  in  his  youth  had  by  chance  seen 
Minerva  bathing.  The  goddess  in  her  wrath  deprived  him  of 
his  sight,  but  afterwards  relenting,  gave  him,  in  compensation,  the 
knowledge  of  future  events.  When  consulted  by  Eteocles,  he 
declared  that  victory  should  fall  to  Thebes  if  Menceceus,  the 
son  of  Creon,  gave  himself  a  voluntary  victim.  The  heroic 
youth,  learning  the  response,  threw  away  his  life  in  the  first  en- 
counter. 

The  siege  continued  long,  with  varying  success.  At  length 
both  hosts  agreed  that  the  brothers  should  decide  their  quarrel 
by  single  combat.     They  fought  and  fell  by  each  other's  hands. 

"Our  brothers  now  both  slain, 
Each  by  the  other's  spear." — AntiCtONE. 

The  armies  then  renewed  the  fight,  and  at  last  the  invaders 
were  forced  to  yield,  and  fled,  leaving  their  dead  unburied. 
Creon,  the  uncle  of  the  fallen  princes,  now  become  king,  caused 
Eteocles  to  be  buried  with  distinguished  honor,  but  suffered  the 
body  of  Polynices  to  lie  where  it  fell,  forbidding  everyone  on 
pain  of  death  to  give  it  burial. 

"  Polynices'  wretched  carcass  lies 
Unburied,  unlamented,  left  expos'd 
A  feast  for  hungry  vultures  on  the  plain." 

— Sophocles  (Francklin's  tr. ). 

Antigone,  the  sister  of  Polynices,  heard  with  indignation  the 
revolting  edict  which  consigned  her  brother's  body  to  the  dogs 
and  vultures,  depriving  it  of  those  rights  which  were  considered

essential  to  the  repose  of  the  dead.  Unmoved  by  the  diss'oading 
counsel  of  an  affectionate  but  timid  sister,  and  unable  to  procure 
assistance,  she  determined  to  brave  the  hazard  and  to  bury  the 
body  with  her  own  hands.  She  was  detected  in  the  act,  and 
Creon  gave  orders  that  she  should  be  buried  alive,  as  having 
deliberately  set  at  nought  the  solemn  edict  of  the  city. 

**  Let  her  be  carried  instant  to  the  cave, 
And  leave  her  there  alone,  to  live,  or  die." 

— Sophocles  ( Francklin'  s  tr. ) . 

Her  lover,  Haemon,  the  son  of  Creon,  unable  to  avert  her 
fate,  would  not  survive  her,  and  fell  by  his  own  hand. 

Antigone  forms  the  subject  of  two  fine  tragedies  of  the  Grecian 
poet  Sophocles.  Mrs.  Jameson,  in  her  *' Characteristics  of 
Women,"  has  compared  her  character  with  that  of  Cordelia,  in 
Shakspeare's   ''King  Lear." 

The  following  is  the  lamentation  of  Antigone  over  (Edipus, 
when  death  has  at  last  relieved  him  from  his  sufferings : — 

**  Alas  !   I  only  wished  I  might  have  died 

With  my  poor  father  ;  wherefore  should  I  ask 

For  longer  life  ? 

O,  I  was  fond  of  misery  with  him  ; 

E'en  what  was  most  unlovely  grew  beloved 

When  he  was  with  me.     O  my  dearest  father, 

Beneath  the  earth  now  in  deep  darkness  hid, 

Worn  as  thou  wert  with  age,  to  me  thou  still 

Wast  dear,  and  shall  be  ever." 

— Sophocles  (FranckUn's  tr.). 

Pe-nero-pe. 

Pe-nel'o-pe  is  another  of  those  mythic  heroines  whose  beauties 
where  rather  those  of  character  and  conduct  than  of  person.  She 
was  the  daughter  of  Icarius,  a  Spartan  prince.  Ulysses,  king 
of  Ithaca,  sought  her  in  marriage,  and  won  her,  over  all  com- 
petitors. "When  the  moment  came  for  the  bride  to  leave  her 
father's  house,  Icarius,  unable  to  bear  the  thoughts  of  parting 
with  his  daughter,  tried  to  persuade  her  to  remain  with  him,  and 
not  accompany  her  husband  to  Ithaca.  Ulysses  gave  Penelope 
her  choice,  to  stay  or  go  with  him.  Penelope  made  no  reply, 
but  dropped  her  veil  over  her  face.    Icarius  urged  her  no  further,

Ulysses  and  Penelope  had  not  enjoyed  their  union  more  than 
a  year  when  it  was  inter- 
rupted by  the  events 
which  called  Ulysses  to 
the  Trojan  war.  During 
his  long  absence,  and 
when  it  was  doubtful 
whether  he  still  lived, 
and  highly  improbable 
that  he  would  ever  re- 
turn, Penelope  was  im- 
portuned by  numerous 
suitors,  from  whom  there 
seemed  no  refuge  but  in 
choosing  one  of  them  for 
her  husband.  Penelope, 
however,  employed 

every  art  to  gain  time, 
still  hoping  for  Ulysses' 
return.  One  of  her  arts 
of  delay  was  engaging  in 
the  preparation  of  a  robe 
for  the  funeral  canopy  of 
Laertes,  her  husband's 
father.  She  pledged  her- 
self to  make  her  choice 

among  the  suitors  when  tne  robe  was  finished.      During  the  day 
she  worked  at  the  robe,  but  in  the  night  she  undid  the  work  of 

the  day. 

* '  Three  full  years 
She  practiced  thus,  and  by  the  fraud  deceived 
The  Grecian  youths."  — Homer  (Bryant's  tr. ). 

This  is  the  famous  Penelope's  web,  which  is  used  as  a  prover- 
bial expression  for  anything  which  is  perpetually  doing  but 
never  done.  The  rest  of  Penelope's  history  will  be  told  when 
we  give  an  account  of  her  husband's  adventures.

Or'pheus  and  Eu-ryd'i-ce. 

Or'pheus  was  the  son  of  Apollo  and  the  muse  Calliope.    He 

was  presented  by  his 
father  with  a  lyre 
and  taught  to  play 
upon  it,  which  he 
did  to  such  perfec- 
tion that  nothing 
could  withstand  the 
charm  of  his  music. 
Not  only  his  fellow- 
mortals  but  wild 
beasts  were  softened 
by  his  strains,  and, 
gathering  around 
him,  laid  by  their 
fierceness,  and  stood 
entranced  with  his 
lay.  Nay,  the  very 
trees  and  rocks  were 
sensible  to  the 
charm.  The  formei 
crowded  round  him, 
and  the  latter  re- 
laxed somewhat  of 
their  hardness,  soft- 
ened by  his  notes.

tials  of  Orpheus  with  Eu-ryd'i-ce  ;  but  though  he  attended,  he 
brought  no  happy  omens  with  him.  His  very  torch  smoked  and 
brought  tears  into  their  eyes.  In  coincidence  with  such  prognos- 
tics, Eurydice,  shortly  after  her  marriage,  while  wandering  with 
the  nymphs,  her  companions,  was  seen  by  the  shepherd  Aristaeus, 
who  was  struck  with  her  beauty,  and  made  advances  to  her.  She 
fled,  and  in  flying  trod  upon  a  snake  in  the  grass,  was  bitte:i  in 
the  foot,  and  died.  Orpheus  sang  his  grief  to  all  who  breathed 
the  upper  air,  both  gods  and  men,  and  finding  it  all  unavailingj 
resolved  to  seek  his  wife  in  the  regions  of  the  dead.  He  de- 
scended by  a  cave  situated  on  the  side  of  the  promontory  of 
Taenarus  and  arrived  at  the  Stygian  realm.  He  passed  through 
crowds  of  ghosts  and  presented  himself  before  the  throne  of 
Pluto  and  Proserpine.  Accompanying  the  words  \vith  the  lyre, 
he  sung,  **0  deities  of  the  under  world,  to  whom  all  we  who 
iive  must  come,  hear  my  words,  for  they  are  true.  I  come  not 
to  spy  out  the  secrets  of  Tartarus,  nor  to  try  my  strength  against 
the  three-headed  dog  with  snaky  hair  who  guards  the  entrance. 

*'Onhestept, 
And  Cerberus  held  agape  his  triple  jaws.'* — Landor. 

**  I  come  to  seek  my  wife,  whose  opening  years  the  poisonous 
viper's  fang  has  brought  to  an  untimely  end.  Love  has  led  me 
here.  Love,  a  god  all-powerful  with  us  who  dwell  on  the  earth, 
and,  if  old  traditions  say  true,  not  less  so  here.  I  implore  you 
by  these  abodes  full  of  terror,  these  realms  of  silence  and  un- 
created things,  unite  again  the  thread  of  Eurydice' s  life.  We 
all  are  destined  to  you,  and  sooner  or  later  must  pass  to  your 
domain.  She,  too,  when  she  shall  have  filled  her  term  of  life, 
will  rightly  be  yours.  But  till  then  grant  her  to  me,  I  beseech 
you.  If  you  deny  me,  I  cannot  return  alone  ;  you  shall  triumph 
in  the  death  of  us  both." 

As  he  sang  these  tender  strains,  the  very  ghosts  shed  tears. 

**  Such  strains  as  would  have  won  the  ear 
Of  Pluto,  to  have  quite  set  free 
His  half- regained  Eury-dice." — MiLTON.

giant's  liver,  the  daughters  of  Danaiis  rested  from  their  task  of 
drawing  water  in  a  sieve,  and  Sisyphus  sat  on  his  rock  to  listen, 

*'  E'en  Tantalus  ceased  from  trying  to  sip 
The  cup  that  flies  from  his  arid  Up  ; 
Ixion,  too,  the  magic  could  feel, 
And,  for  a  moment,  blocked  his  wheel : 
Poor  Sisyphus,  doomed  to  tumble  and  toss 
The  notable  stone  that  gathers  no  moss, 
Let  go  his  burden,  and  turned  to  hear 
The  charming  sounds  that  ravished  his  ear." — Saxe. 

Then  for  the  first  time,  it  is  said,  the  cheeks  of  the  Furies 
were  wet  with  tears.  Proserpine  could  not  resist,  and  Pluto  him- 
self gave  way.

To  hear  the  Poet' s  prayer ; 
Stern  Proserpine  relented, 
And  gave  him  back  the  fair." — Pope. 

Eurydice  was  called.  She  came  from  among  the  new-arrived 
ghosts,  limping  with  her  wounded  foot.  Orpheus  was  permitted 
to  take  her  away  with  him  on  one  condition,  that  he  should  not 
turn  round  to  look  at  her  till  they  should  have  reached  the  upper 
air.  Under  this  condition  they  proceeded  on  their  way,  he 
leading,  she  following,  through  passages  dark  and  steep,  in  total 
silence,  till  they  had  nearly  reached  the  outlet  into  the  cheerful 
upper  world,  when  Orpheus,  in  a  moment  of  forgetfulness,  to 
assure  himself  that  she  was  still  following,  cast  a  glance  behind 
him,  when  instantly  she  was  borne  away.  Stretching  out  their 
arms  to  embrace  one  another,  they  grasped  only  the  air  !  Dying 
now  a  second  time,  she  yet  cannot  reproach  her  husband,  for  how 
can  she  blame  his  impatience  to  behold  her  !  *'  Farewell  !"  he 
said,  *'a  last  farewell !" — and  was  hurried  away  so  fast  that  the 
sound  hardly  reached  his  ears. 

Orpheus  endeavored  to  follow  her,  and  besought  permission  to 
return  and  try  once  more  for  her  release  ;  but  the  stern  ferryman 
repulsed  him  and  refused  passage.  Seven  days  he  lingered  about 
the  brink,  without  food  or  sleep  ;  then  bitterly  accusing  of  cruelty 
the  powers  of  P>ebus,  he  sang  his  complaints  to  the  rocks  and 
mountains,  melting  the  hearts  of  tigers  and  moving  the  oaks 
from  their  stations.

javelin.  The  weapon,  as  soon  as  it  came  within  the  sound  of 
his  lyre,  fell  harmless  at  his  feet.  So  did  also  the  stones  that 
they  threw  at  him.  But  the  women  raised  a  scream  and  drowned 
the  voice  of  the  music,  and  then  the  missiles  reached  him  and 
soon  were  stained  with  his  blood.  The  maniacs  tore  him  limb 
from  limb,  and  threw  his  head  and  his  lyre  into  the  river  Hebrus, 
down  which  they  floated,  murmuring  sad  music,  to  which  the 
shores  responded  a  plaintive  symphony.  The  Muses  gathered 
up  the  fragments  of  his  body  and  buried  them  at  Libethra,  where 
the  nightingale  is  said  to  sing  over  his  grave  more  sweetly  than 
in  any  other  part  of  Greece. 

**  Singing  a  love  song  to  his  brooding  mate, 
Did  Thracian  shepherd  by  the  grave 
Of  Orpheus  hear  a  sweeter  melody.

All  his  own  power  infuse,  to  swell 

The  incense  that  he  loves.*' — Southey. 

His  lyre  was  placed  by  Jupiter  among  the  stars.  His  shade 
passed  a  second  time  to  Tartarus,  where  he  sought  out  his  Euryd- 
ice  and  embraced  her  with  eager  arms.  They  roam  the  happy 
fields  together  now,  sometimes  he  leading,  sometimes  she ;  and 
Orpheus  gazes  as  much  as  he  will  upon  her,  no  longer  incurring 
a  penalty  for  a  thoughtless  glance. 

The  story  of  Orpheus  has  furnished  Pope  with  an  illustration 
of  the  power  of  music,  for  his  *'  Ode  for  St.  Cecilia's  Day."  The 
following  stanza  relates  the  conclusion  of  the  story  : — 

*•  But  soon,  too  soon,  the  lover  turns  his  eyes  ; 
Again  she  falls,  again  she  dies,  she  dies  !

No  crime  was  thine,  if 'tis  no  crime  to  love.

Beside  the  falls  of  fountains, 
Or  where  Hebrus  wanders, 
Rolling  in  meanders,

Ah,  see,  he  dies  ! 
Yet  even  in  death  Eurydice  he  sung, 
Eurydice   still  trembled  on  his  tongue ; 
Eurydice  the  woods, 
Eurydice  the  floods, 
Eurydice  the  rocks  and  hollow  mountains  rung.'* 

Ar-is-tae'us,  the  Bee-keeper. 

Man  avails  himself  of  the  instincts  of  the  inferior  animals  foi 
his  own  advantage. 

**  True  therefore  doth  heaven  divide 
The  state  of  man  in  divers  functions, 
Setting  endeavor  in  continual  motion, 
To  which  is  fixed  as  an  aim  or  butt 
Obedience ;  for  so  work  the  honey-bees, 
Creatures  that,  by  a  rule  in  nature,  teach 
The  act  of  order  to  a  peopled  kingdom." — Shakespeare. 

Hence  sprang  the  art  of  keeping  bees.  Honey  must  first  have 
been  known  as  a  wild  product,  the  bees  building  their  structures 
in  hollow  trees  or  holes  in  the  rocks,  or  any  similar  cavity  that 
chance  offered.  Thus  occasionally  the  carcass  of  a  dead  animal 
would  be  occupied  by  the  bees  for  ttiat  purpose.  It  was  no 
doubt  from  some  such  incident  that  the  superstition  arose  that 
the  bees  were  engendered  by  the  decaying  flesh  of  the  animal ; 
and  Virgil,  in  the  following  story,  shows  how  this  supposed  fact 
may  be  turned  to  account  for  renewing  the  swarm  when  it  has 
been  lost  by  disease  or  accident. 

Ar-is-tae'us,  who  first  taught  the  management  of  bees,  was 
the  son  of  the  water-nymph  Cyrene.  His  bees  had  perished,  and 
he  resorted  for  aid  to  his  mother.  He  stood  at  the  river  side 
and  thus  addressed  her :  **  O  mother,  the  pride  of  my  life  is  taken 
from  me  !  I  have  lost  my  precious  bees.  My  care  and  skill 
have  availed  me  nothing,  and  you,  my  mother,  have  not  warded 
off  from  me  the  blow  of  misfortune."  His  mother  heard  these 
complaints  as  she  sat  in  her  palace  at  the  bottom  of  the  river, 
with  her  attendant  nymphs  around  her.     They  were  engaged  iu

female  occupations,  spinning  and  weaving,  while  one  told  stories 
to  amuse  the  rest.  The  sad  voice  of  Aristaeus  interrupting  their 
occupation,  one  of  them  put  her  head  above  the  water,  and  seeing 
him,  returned  and  gave  information  to  his  mother,  who  ordered 
that  he  should  be  brought  into  her  presence.  The  river  at  her 
command  opened  itself  and  let  him  pass  in,  while  it  stood  curled 
like  a  mountain  on  either  side.  He  descended  to  the  region 
where  the  fountains  of  the  great  rivers  lie  ;  he  saw  the  enormous 
receptacles  of  waters  and  was  almost  deafened  with  the  roar, 
while  he  surveyed  them  hurrying  off  in  various  directions  to 
water  the  face  of  the  earth.  Arriving  at  his  mother's  apartment, 
he  was  hospitably  received  by  Cyrene  and  her  nymphs,  who 
spread  their  table  with  the  richest  dainties. 

<*  Sabrina  fair ! 
Listen  where  thou  art  sitting 
Under  the  glassy,  cool,  translucent  wave, 

In  twisted  braids  of  lilies  knitting 
The  loose  train  of  thy  amber- dropping  hair ; 
Listen  for  dear  honor' s  sake, 
Goddess  of  the  silver  lake  ! 

Listen  and  save." — Milton's  Comus. 

They  first  poured  out  libations  to  Neptune,  then  regaled  them- 
selves with  the  feast,  and  after  that  Cyrene  thus  addressed  him  : 
**  There  is  an  old  prophet  named  Proteus,  who  dwells  in  the  sea 
and  is  a  favorite  of  Neptune,  whose  herd  of  sea-calves  he  pastures. 
We  nymphs  hold  him  in  great  respect,  for  he  is  a  learned  sage 
and  knows  all  things,  past,  present,  and  to  come.  He  can  tell 
you,  my  son,  the  cause  of  the  mortality  among  your  bees,  and 
how  you  may  remedy  it.  But  he  will  not  do  it  voluntarily,  how- 
ever you  may  entreat  him.  You  must  compel  him  by  force. 
If  you  seize  him  and  chain  him,  he  will  answer  your  questions 
in  order  to  get  released,  for  he  cannot  by  all  his  arts  get  away 
if  you  hold  fast  the  chains.  I  will  carry  you  to  his  cave,  where 
he  comes  at  noon  to  take  his  midday  repose.  Then  you  may 
easily  secure  him.  But  when  he  finds  himself  captured,  his  re-

have  only  to  keep  him  fast  bound,  and  at  last,  when  he  finds  ali

your  commands."  So  saying,  she  sprinkled  her  son  with  fragrant 
nectar,  the  beverage  of  the  gods,  and  immediately  an  unusual 
vigor  filled  his  frame  and  courage  his  heart,  while  perfume 
breathed  all  around  him. 

The  nymph  led  her.  son  to  the  prophet's  cave  and  concealed 
him  among  the  recesses  of  the  rocks,  while  she  herself  took  her 
place  behind  the  clouds.  When  noon  came,  and  the  hour  when 
men  and  herds  retreat  from  the  glaring  sun  to  indulge  in  quiet 
slumber,  Proteus  issued  from  the  water,  followed  by  his  herd  of 
sea-calves,  which  spread  themselves  along  the  shore.  He  sat  on 
the  rock  and  counted  his  herd,  then  stretched  himself  on  the 
floor  of  the  cave  and  went  to  sleep.  Aristseus  hardly  allowed 
him  to  get  fairly  asleep  before  he  fixed  the  fetters  on  him  and 
shouted  aloud.  Proteus,  waking  and  finding  himself  captured, 
immediately  resorted  to  his  arts,  becoming  first  a  fire,  then  a 
flood,  then  a  horrible  wild  beast,  in  rapid  succession.  But  find- 
ing all  would  not  do,  he  at  last  resumed  his  own  form  and  ad- 
dressed the  youth  in  angry  accents :  **  Who  are  you,  bold  youth, 
who  thus  invade  my  abode,  and  what  do  you  want  with  me?" 
Aristaeus  replied,  **  Proteus,  you  know  already,  for  it  is  needless 
for  any  one  to  attempt  to  deceive  you.  And  do  you  also  cease 
your  efforts  to  elude  me.  I  am  led  hither  by  divine  assistance, 
to  know  from  you  the  cause  of  my  misfortune  and  how  to  remedy 
it.*'  At  these  words  the  prophet,  fixing  on  him  his  gray  eyes 
with  a  piercing  look,  thus  spoke :  **  You  receive  the  merited  re- 
ward of  your  deeds,  by  which  Eurydice  met  her  death,  for  in 
flying  from  you  she  trod  upon  a  serpent,  of  whose  bite  she  died. 
To  avenge  her  death,  the  nymphs,  her  companions,  sent  this  de- 
struction to  your  bees.  You  have  to  appease  their  anger,  and 
thus  it  must  be  done  :  Select  four  bulls,  of  perfect  form  and  size, 
and  four  cows  of  equal  beauty,  build  four  altars  to  the  nymphs, 
and  sacrifice  the  animals,  leaving  their  carcasses  in  the  leafy 
grove.  To  Orpheus  and  Eurydice  you  shall  pay  such  funeral 
honors  as  may  allay  their  resentment.  Returning  after  nine  days, 
you  will  examine  the  bodies  of  the  cattle  slain  and  see  what  will 

befall."    Aristaeus  faithfully  obeyed  these  directions.    He  sacri-

taught  him  to  play  upon  it,  and  his  brother  occupied  himself 
in  hunting  and  tending  the  flocks.  Meanwhile  Antiope,  their 
mother,  who  had  been  treated  with  great  cruelty  by  Lycus,  the 
usurping  king  of  Thebes,  and  by  Dirce,  his  wife,  found  means  to 
'nform  her  children  of  their  rights  and  to  summon  them  to  her 
assistance.  With  a  band  of  their  fellow-herdsmen  they  at- 
tacked and  slew  Lycus,  and  tying  Dirce  by  the  hair  of  her  head 
to  a  bull,  let  him  drag  her  till  she  was  dead.  Amphion,  having 
become  king  of  Thebes,  fortified  the  city  with  a  wall.  It  is  said 
that  when  he  played  on  his  lyre  the  stones  moved  of  their  own 
accord  and  took  their  places  in  the  wall.

while  playing,  Minerva  threw  the  instrument  indignantly  away, 
and  it  fell  down  to  earth,  and  was  found  by  Mar'sy-as.  He

Me-lam'pus. 

Me-lam'pus  was  the  first  mortal  endowed  with  prophetic 
powers.  Before  his  house  there  stood  an  oak  tree  containing  a 
serpent's  nest.  The  old  serpents  were  killed  by  the  servants, 
but  Melampus  took  care  of  the  young  ones,  and  fed  them  care- 
fully. One  day,  when  he  was  asleep  under  the  oak,  the  serpents 
licked  his  ears  with  their  tongues.  On  awaking  he  was  aston- 
ished to  find  that  he  now  understood  the  language  of  birds  and 
creeping  things.  This  knowledge  enabled  him  to  foretell  future 
events,  and  he  became  a  renowned  soothsayer.  At  one  time  his 
enemies  took  him  captive  and  kept  him  strictly  imprisoned. 
Melampus,  in  the  silence  of  the  night,  heard  the  wood-worms  in 
the  timbers  talking  together,  and  found  out  by  what  they  said  that 
the  timbers  were  nearly  eaten  through  and  the  roof  would  soon 
fall  in.  He  told  his  captors  and  demanded  to  be  let  out,  warn- 
ing them  also.  They  took  his  warning  and  thus  escaped  de- 
struction, and  rewarded  Melampus  and  held  him  in  high  honor.

CHAPTER  XXV. 

A-ri'on — Ib'y-cus — Si-mon'i-des — Sap'pho. 

The  poets  whose  adventures  compose  this  chapter  were  real 
persons,  some  of  whose  works  yet  remain,  and  their  influence  on 
poets  who  succeeded  them  is  yet  more  important  than  their 
poetical  remains.  The  adventures  recorded  of  them  in  the  fol- 
lowing stories  rest  on  the  same  authority  as  other  narratives  of 
the  Age  of  Fable,  that  is,  of  the  poets  who  have  told  them.  In 
their  present  form,  the  first  two  are  translated  from  the  German — 
Arion  from  Schlegel  and  Ibycus  from  Schiller. 

A-ri'on. 

A-ri'on  was  a  famous  musician,  and  dwelt  in  the  court  of  Peri- 
ander,  king  of  Corinth,  with  whom  he  was  a  great  favorite. 
There  was  to  be  a  musical  contest  in  Sicily,  and  Arion  longed  to 
compete  for  the  prize.  Ke  told  his  wish  to  Periander,  who  be- 
sought him  like  a  brother  to  give  up  the  thought.  "  Pray  stay 
with  me,"  he  said,  ''and  be  contented.  He  who  strives  to  win 
may  lose."  Arion  answered,  ''  A  wandering  life  best  suits  the 
free  heart  of  a  poet.  The  talent  which  a  god  bestowed  on  me 
I  would  fain  make  a  source  of  pleasure  to  others.  And  if  I  win 
the  prize,  how  will  the  enjoyment  of  it  be  increased  by  the  con- 
sciousness of  my  wide-spread  fame  !"  He  went,  won  the  prize, 
and  embarked  with  his  wealth  In  a  Corinthian  ship  for  home. 
On  the  second  morning  after  setting  sail,  the  wind  breathed  mild 
and  fair.  **  O  Periander,"  he  exclaimed,  '*  dismiss  your  fears  1 
Soon  shall  you  forget  them  in  my  embrace.     With  what  lavish

offerings  will  we  display  our  gratitude  to  the  gods,  and  how 
merry  will  we  be  at  the  festal  board  !"  The  wind  and  sea  con- 
tinued propitious.  Not  a  cloud  dimmed  the  firmament.  He 
had  not  trusted  too  much  to  the  ocean, — but  he  had  to  man. 
He  overheard  the  seamen  exchanging  hints  with  one  another, 
and  found  they  were  plotting  to  possess  themselves  of  his  treasure. 
Presently  they  surrounded  him,  loud  and  mutinous,  and  said, 
*'  Arion,  you  must  die  !  If  you  would  have  a  grave  on  shore, 
yield  yourself  to  die  on  this  spot ;  but  if  otherwise,  cast  yourself 
into  the  sea. ' '  **  Will  nothing  satisfy  you  but  my  life  ?' '  said  he. 
**  Take  my  gold,  and  welcome.  I  willingly  buy  my  life  at  that 
price."  **  No,  no  ;  we  cannot  spare  you.  Your  life  would  be 
too  dangerous  to  us.  Where  could  we  go  to  escape  from  Peri- 
ander,  if  he  should  know  that  you  had  been  robbed  by  us  ?  Your 
gold  would  be  of  little  use  to  us,  if,  on  returning  home,  we 
could  never  more  be  free  from  fear,"  *'  Grant  me,  then,"  said 
he,  **a  last  request,  since  nought  will  avail  to  save  my  life,  that 
I  may  die  as  I  have  lived,  as  becomes  a  bard.  When  I  shall 
have  sung  my  death-song,  and  my  harp-strings  shall  have  ceased 
to  vibrate,  then  I  will  bid  farewell  to  life  and  yield  uncomplain- 
ing to  my  fate. ' '  This  prayer,  like  the  others,  would  have  been 
unheeded, — they  thought  only  of  their  booty, — but  to  hear  so 
famous  a  musician,  that  moved  their  rude  hearts.  ''  Suffer  me," 
he  added,  **  to  arrange  my  dress.  Apollo  will  not  favor  me  un- 
less I  be  clad  in  my  minstrel  garb." 

He  clothed  his  well-proportioned  limbs  in  gold  and  purple  fair 
to  see,  his  tunic  fell  around  him  in  graceful  folds,  jewels  adorned 
his  arms,  his  brow  was  crowned  with  a  golden  wreath,  and  over 
his  neck  and  shoulders  flowed  his  hair,  perfumed  with  odors.  His 
left  hand  held  the  lyre,  his  right  the  ivory  wand  with  which  he 
struck  its  chords.  Like  one  inspired,  he  seemed  to  drink  the 
morning  air  and  glitter  in  the  morning  ray.  The  seamen  gazed 
with  admiration. 

"  Meantime  some  rude  Arion' s  restless  hand 
Wakes  the  brisk  hannony  that  sailors  love  j 
A  circle  there  of  merry  listeners  stand, 
Or  to  some  well-known  measure  featly  move 
Thoughtless,  as  if  on  shore  they  still  were  free  to  rove." — Byron. 

He  strode  forward  to  the  vessel's  side  and  looked  down  into

rhe  blue  sea.  Addressing  his  lyre,  he  sang  ''Companion  of  my 
voice,  come  with  me  to  the  realm  of  shades.  Though  Cerberus 
may  growl,  we  know  the  power  of  song  can  tame  his  rage.  Ye 
heroes  of  Elysium,  who  have  passed  the  darkling  flood, — ye 
happy  souls,  soon  shall  I  join  your  band.  Yet  can  ye  relieve 
my  grief?  Alas,  I  leave  my  friend  behind  me.  Thou,  who 
didst  find  thy  Eurydice,  and  lose  her  again  as  soon  as  found ; 
when  she  had  vanished  like  a  dream,  how  didst  thou  hate  the 
cheerful  light !  I  must  away,  but  I  will  not  fear.  The  gods 
look  down  upon  us.  Ye  who  slay  me  unoffending,  when  I  am 
no  more,  your  time  of  trembling  shall  come.  Ye  Nereids,  re- 
ceive your  guest,  who  throws  himself  upon  your  mercy  !"  So 
saying,  he  sprang  into  the  deep  sea.  The  waves  covered  him, 
and  the  seamen  held  on  their  way,  fancying  themselves  safe 
from  all  danger  of  detection. 

But  the  strains  of  his  music  had  drawn  round  him  the  inhab- 
itants of  the  deep  to  listen,  and  Dolphins  followed  the  ship  as 
if  chained  by  a  spell.  While  he  struggled  in  the  waves,  a  Dol- 
phin offered  him  his  back,  and  carried  him  mounted  thereon 
safe  to  land. 

**  Even  when  as  yet  the  dolphin  which  him  bore 
Through  the  ^gean  Seas  from  pirates'  view. 
Stood  still,  by  him  astonished  at  his  lore, 
And  all  the  raging  seas  for  joy  forgot  to  roar." — Spenser. 

At  the  spot  where  he  landed  a  monument  of  brass  was  after- 
wards erected  upon  the  rocky  shore,  to  preserve  the  memory  of 
the  event. 

When  Arion  and  the  Dolphin  parted,  each  to  his  own  ele- 
ment, Arion  thus  poured  forth  his  thanks:  ''Farewell,  thou 
faithful,  friendly  fish  !  Would  that  I  could  reward  thee  ;  but 
thou  canst  not  wend  with  me,  nor  I  with  thee.  Companionship 
we  may  not  have.  May  Galatea,  queen  of  the  deep,  accord 
thee  her  favor,  and  thou,  proud  of  the  burden,  draw  her  chariot 
over  the  smooth  mirror  of  the  deep." 

Arion  hastened  from  the  shore,  and  soon  saw  before  him  the 
towers  of  Corinth.  He  journeyed  on,  harp  in  hand,  singing  as 
he  went,  full  of  love  and  happiness,  forgetting  his  losses,  and 
mindful  only  of  what  remained,  his  friend  and  his  lyre.     Ho

entered  the  hospitable  walls,  and  was  soon  clasped  in  the 
embrace  of  Periander.  "  I  come  back  to  thee,  my  friend,"  he 
said.  ''  The  talent  M^hich  a  god  bestowed  has  been  the  delight 
of  thousands,  but  false  knaves  have  stripped  me  of  my  well- 
earned  treasure ;  yet  I  retain  the  consciousness  of  widespread 
fame. ' '  Then  he  told  Periander  all  the  wonderful  events  that 
had  befallen  him,  who  heard  him  with  amazement.  ^*  Shall 
such  wickedness  triumph?"  said  he.  *'Then  in  vain  is  power 
lodged  in  my  hands.  That  we  may  discover  the  criminals,  you 
must  remain  here  in  concealment,  and  so  they  will  approach 
without  suspicion."  When  the  ship  arrived  in  the  harbor,  he 
summoned  the  mariners  before  him.  *'  Have  you  heard  any- 
thing of  Arion?"  he  inquired.      **I  anxiously  look  for  his  re- 


turn." 


"Arion,  whose  melodic  soul 
Taught  the  dithyramb  to  roll."— GEORGE  Eliot. 

They  replied,  "We  left  him  well  and  prosperous  in  Taren- 
tum."  As  they  said  these  words,  Arion  stepped  forth  and 
faced  them.  His  well-proportioned  limbs  were  arrayed  in  gold 
and  purple  fair  to  see,  his  tunic  fell  around  him  in  graceful  folds, 
jewels  adorned  his  arms,  his  brow  was  crowned  with  a  golden 
wreath,  and  over  his  neck  and  shoulders  flowed  his  hair,  per- 
fumed with  odors.  His  left  hand  held  the  lyre,  his  right  the 
ivory  wand  with  which  he  struck  its  chords.  They  fell  pros- 
trate at  his  feet,  as  if  a  lightning  bolt  had  struck  them.  **  We 
meant  to  murder  him,  and  he  has  become  a  god.  O  Earth, 
open  and  receive  us!"  Then  Periander  spoke.  *'He  lives, 
the  master  of  the  lay  !  Kind  heaven  protects  the  poet's  life. 
As  for  you,  I  invoke  not  the  spirit  of  vengeance ;  Arion  wishes 
not  your  blood.  Ye  slaves  of  avarice,  begone  !  Seek  some 
barbarous  land,  and  never  may  aught  beautiful  delight  your 
souls!" 

Ib'y-cus. 

In  order  to  understand  the  story  of  Ib'y-cus,  which  follows^  it 
is  necessary  to  remember,  first,  that  the  theatres  of  the  ancients 
were  immense  fabrics  capable  of  pontaining  from  ten  to  thirty 
thousand  spectators,  and  as  they  were  only  used  on  festal  occa- 


IBYCUS,  249 

si'ons,  and  admission  was  free  to  all,  they  were  usually  filled. 
They  were  without  roofs  and  open  to  the  sky,  and  the  perform- 
ances were  in  the  daytime.  Secondly,  the  appalling  representa- 
tion of  the  Furies  is  not  exaggerated  in  the  story.  It  is  recorded 
that  ^schylus,  the  tragic  poet,  having  on  one  occasion  repre- 
sented the  Furies  in  a  chorus  of  fifty  performers,  the  terror  of 
the  spectators  was  such  that  many  fainted  and  were  thrown  into 
convulsions,  and  the  magistrates  forbade  a  like  representation 
for  the  future. 

Ibycus,  the  pious  poet,  was  on  his  way  to  the  chariot  races 
and  musical  competitions  held  at  the  Isthmus  of  Corinth,  which 
attracted  all  of  Grecian  lineage.  Apollo  had  bestowed  on 
him  the  gift  of  song,  the  honeyed  lips  of  the  poet,  and  he  pur- 
sued his  way  with  lightsome  step,  full  of  the  god.  Already  the 
towers  of  Corinth  crowning  the  height  appeared  in  view,  and  he 
had  entered  with  pious  awe  the  sacred  grove  of  Neptune.  No 
living  object  was  in  sight ;  only  a  flock  of  cranes  flew  overhead, 
taking  the  same  course  as  himself  in  their  migration  to  a  southern 
clime.  **Good  luck  to  you,  ye  friendly  squadrons,"  he  ex- 
claimed, * '  my  companions  from  across  the  sea. 

•* '  All  hail,  beloved  birds,'  he  cried, 
*  My  comrades  on  the  ocean  tide. '  ' ' 

— Schiller  (Hempel). 

'  *  I  take  your  company  for  a  good  omen.  We  come  from  far,  and 
fly  in  search  of  hospitality.  May  both  of  us  meet  that  kind  re- 
ception which  shields  the  stranger-guest  from  harm  ! ' ' 

He  paced  briskly  on,  and  soon  was  in  the  middle  of  the  wood. 
There  suddenly,  at  a  narrow  pass,  two  robbers  stepped  forth  and 
barred  his  way.  He  must  yield  or  fight.  But  his  hand,  accus- 
tomed to  the  lyre  and  not  to  the  strife  of  arms,  sank  powerless. 
He  called  for  help  on  men  and  gods,  but  his  cry  reached  no  de- 
fender's ear.  *'Then  here  must  I  die,"  said  he,  ''  in  a  strange 
land,  unlamented,  cut  off"  by  the  hand  of  outlaws,  and  see  none 
to  avenge  my  cause."  Sore  wounded  he  sank  to  the  earth, 
when  hoarse  screamed  the  cranes  overhead.  *'Take  up  my 
cause,  ye  cranes, ' '  he  said,  '  *  since  no  voice  but  yours  answers 
to  my  cry. ' '

**  *  Ye  whose  wild  wings  above  me  hover. 
Since  never  voice  save  yours  alone 
The  deed  can  tell — the  hand  discover — 
Avenge  !'  he  spoke,  and  life  was  gone." 

— Schiller  (Hempel). 

Ibycus  was  dead,  and  the  cranes  alone  knew  by  what  means. 
The  body,  despoiled  and  mangled,  was  found,  and  though 
disfigured  with  wounds,  was  recognized  by  the  friend  in  Corinth 
who  had  expected  him  as  a  guest.  **  Is  it  thus  I  find  you  re- 
stored to  me?"  he  exclaimed;  *'I  who  hoped  to  entwine  your 
temples  with  the  wreath  of  triumph  in  the  strife  of  song  !" 

The  guests  assembled  at  the  festival  heard  the  tidings  with  dis- 
may. All  Greece  felt  the  wound,  every  heart  owned  its  loss. 
They  crowded  round  the  tribunal  of  the  magistrates,  and  de- 
manded vengeance  on  the  murderers  and  expiation  with  their 
blood. 

But  what  trace  or  mark  shall  point  out  the  perpetrator  from 
amidst  the  vast  multitude  attracted  by  the  splendor  of  the  feast  ? 
Did  he  fall  by  the  hands  of  robbers  or  did  some  private  enemy 
slay  him  ?  The  all-discerning  sun  alone  can  tell,  for  no  other 
eye  beheld  it.  Yet  not  improbably  the  murderer  even  now  walks 
in  the  midst  of  the  throng,  and  enjoys  the  fruits  of  his  crime, 
while  vengeance  seeks  for  him  in  vain.  Perhaps  in  their  own 
temple's  enclosure  he  defies  the  gods,  mingling  freely  in  this 
throng  of  men  that  now  presses  into  the  amphitheatre. 

For  now,  crowded  together,  row  on  row,  the  multitude  fill  the 
seats  till  it  seems  as  if  the  very  fabric  would  give  way.  The 
murmur  of  voices  sounds  like  the  roar  of  the  sea,  while  the  circles, 
widening  in  their  ascent,  rise  tier  on  tier,  as  if  they  would  reach 
the  sky. 

And  now  the  vast  assemblage  listens  to  the  awful  voice  of  the 
chorus  personating  the  Furies,  which  in  solemn  guise  advances 
with  measured  step,  and  moves  around  the  circuit  of  the  theatre. 
Can  they  be  mortal  women  who  compose  that  awful  group,  and 
can  that  vast  concourse  of  silent  forms  be  living  beings  ! 

The  Choristers,  clad  in  black,  bore  in  their  fleshless  hands 
torches  blazing  with  a  pitchy  flame.  Their  cheeks  were  blood- 
less, and  in  place  of  hair,  writhing  and  swelling  serpents  curled 
around  their  brows.     Forming  a  circle,  these  awful  beings  sang 


lEYCUS.  251 

their  hymn,  rending  the  hearts  of  the  guilty,  and  enchaining 
all  their  faculties.  It  rose  and  swelled,  overpowering  the  sound 
of  the  instruments,  stealing  the  judgment,  palsying  the  heart, 
curdling  the  blood. 

''Happy  the  man  who  keeps  his  heart  pure  from  guilt  and 
crime  !  Him  we  avengers  touch  not ;  he  treads  the  path  of  life 
secure  from  us.  But  woe  !  woe  !  to  him  who  has  done  the  deed 
of  secret  murder.  We,  the  fearful  family  of  Night,  fasten  ourselves 
upon  his  whole  being.  Thinks  he  by  flight  to  escape  us  ?  We 
fly  still  faster  in  pursuit,  twine  our  snakes  around  his  feet,  and 
bring  him  to  the  ground.  Unwearied  we  pursue  ;  no  pity  checks 
ou»  course ;  still  on  and  on,  to  the  end  of  life,  we  give  him  no 
peav.e  nor  rest."  Thus  the  Eumenides  sang,  and  moved  in 
solemn  cadence,  while  stillness  like  the  stillness  of  death  sat  over 
the  whole  assembly  as  if  in  the  presence  of  superhuman  beings ; 
and  then,  in  solemn  march  completing  the  circuit  of  the  theatre, 
they  passed  out  at  the  back  of  the  stage. 

Every  heart  fluttered  between  illusion  and  reality,  and  every 
breast  panted  with  undefined  terror,  quailing  before  the  awful 
power  that  w^atches  secret  crimes  and  winds  unseen  the  skein  of 
destiny.  At  that  moment  a  cry  burst  forth  from  one  of  the  up- 
permost benches — **  Look  !  look !  comrade,  yonder  are  the  cranes 
of Ibycus !" 

**  Just  then,  amidst  the  highest  tier, 
Breaks  forth  a  voice  that  starts  the  ear  : 
*  See  there,  see  there,  Timotheus, 
Behold  the  cranes  of  Ibycus.'  " — Schiller  (Hempel). 

And  suddenly  there  appeared  sailing  across  the  sky  a  dark  ob- 
ject, which  a  moment's  inspection  showed  to  be  a  flock  of  cranes 
flying  directly  over  the  theatre.  **0f  Ibycus!  did  he  say  ?" 
The  beloved  name  revived  the  sorrow  in  every  breast.  As  wave 
follows  wave  over  the  face  of  the  sea,  so  ran  from  mouth  to  mouth 
the  words,  *'  Of  Ibycus  !  him  whom  we  all  lament,  whom  some 
murderer's  hand  laid  low  !  What  have  the  cranes  to  do  with 
him  ?"  And  louder  grew  the  swell  of  voices,  while  like  a  light- 
ning's flash  the  thought  sped  through  every  heart,  '*  Observe  the 
power  of  the  Eumenides  !  The  pious  poet  shall  be  avenged  ! 
the  murderer  has  informed  against  himself.  Seize  the  man  who 
littered  that  cry,  and  the  other  to  whom  he  spoke ! '  *

The  culprit  would  gladly  have  recalled  his  words,  but  it  was 

too  late. 

**  Scarce  had  the  wretch  the  words  let  fall 

Than  fain  their  sense  he  would  recall." 

— Schiller  (Hempel). 

The  faces  of  the  murderers,  pale  with  terror,  betrayed  their 
guilt.  The  people  took  them  before  the  judge,  they  confessed 
their  crime,  and  suiTered  the  punishment  they  deserved. 

Si-mon'i-des. 

Si-mon'i-des  was  one  of  the  most  prolific  of  the  early  poets 
of  Greece,  but  only  a  few  fragments  of  his  compositions  have 
descended  to  us.  He  wrote  hymns,  triumphal  odes  and  elegies. 
In  the  last  species  of  composition  he  particularly  excelled.  His 
genius  was  inclined  to  the  pathetic,  and  none  could  touch  with 
truer  effect  the  chords  of  human  sympathy. 

Simonides  passed  much  of  his  life  at  the  courts  of  princes, 
and  often  employed  his  talents  in  panegyric  and  festal  odes,  re- 
ceiving his  reward  from  the  munificence  of  those  whose  exploits 
he  celebrated. 

On  one  occasion,  when  residing  at  the  court  of  Scopas,  king 
of  Thessaly,  the  prince  desired  him  to  prepare  a  poem  in  cele- 
bration of  his  exploits,  to  be  recited  at  a  banquet.  In  order  to 
diversify  his  theme,  Simonides,  who  was  celebrated  for  his  piety, 
introduced  into  his  poem  the  exploits  of  Castor  and  Pollux. 
Such  digressions  were  not  unusual  Avith  the  poets  on  similar 
occasions.  But  vanity  is  exacting  ;  and  as  Scopas  sat  at  his 
festal  board,  among  his  courtiers  and  sycophants,  he  grudged 
every  verse  that  did  not  rehearse  his  own  praises.  When  Simon- 
ides approached  to  receive  the  promised  reward  Scopas  bestowed 
but  half  the  expected  sum,  saying,  '^  Here  is  payment  for  my 
portion  of  thy  performance ;  Castor  and  Pollux  will  doubtless 
compensate  thee  for  so  much  as  relates  to  them."  The  discon- 
certed poet  returned  to  his  seat  amidst  the  laughter  which  fol- 
lowed the  great  man's  jest.  In  a  little  time  he  received  a 
message  that  two  young  men  on  horseback  were  waiting  without 
and  anxious  to  see  him.  Simonides  hastened  to  the  door,  but 
looked  in  vain  for  the  visitors.  Scarcely,  however,  had  he  left 
the  banqueting-hall  when  the  roof  fell  in  with  a  loud  crash, 
burying  Scopas  and  all  his  guests  beneath  the  ruins.     On  in-

quiring  as  to  the  appearance  of  the  young  men  who  had  sent, 
for  him,  Simonides  was  satisfied  that  they  were  no  other  than 
Castor  and  Pollux  themselves. 

Sap'pho. 

Sap'pho  was  a  poetess  who  flourished  in  a  very  early  age  of 
Greek  literature.  Of  her  works  few  fragments  remain,  but  they 
q.re  enough  to  establish  her  claim  to  eminent  poetical  genius. 
The  story  of  Sappho,  commonly  alluded  to,  is  that  she  was  pas. 


Sappho  and  Alcseus  (H.  Barck). 

sionately  in  love  with  a  beautiful  youth  named  Phaon,  and  fail 
ing   to  obtain  a  return  of  affection  she  threw  herself  from  the 
promontory  of  Leucadia  into   the  sea,  under  a  superstition  that 
those  who  should  take  that   **  Lover' s-leap  "  would,  if  not  de- 
stroyed, be  cured  of  their  love.

That  breast  imbued  with  such  immortal  fire?" — BYB.0I6,

CHAPTER  XXVI. 

Di-a'na  —  En-dym'i-on  —  O-ri'on — Ple'ia-des— Aurora 
and  Ti-tho'nus — A'cis  and  Gal-a-te'a. 

Di-a'na  and  En-dym'i-on. 

En-dym'i-on  was  a  beautiful  youth,  who  fed  his  flock  on 
Mount  Latmos.  One  calm,  clear  night,  Di-a'na,  the  Moon^ 
looked  down  and  saw  him  sleeping. 

**  How  the  pale  Phoebe,  hunting  in  a  grove, 
First  saw  the  boy  Endymion,  from  whose  eyes 
She  took  eternal  fire  that  never  dies.'* — Fletcher. 

The  cold  heart  of  the  virgin  goddess  was  warmed  by  his  sur- 
passing beauty,  and  she  came  down  to  him,  kissed  him,  and 
watched  over  him  while  he  slept. 

**  There  came  a  lovely  vision  of  a  maid, 
Who  seemed  to  step  as  from  a  golden  car 
Out  of  the  low-hung  moon." — Morris. 

Another  story  was  that  Jupiter  bestowed  on  him  the  gift  of 

perpetual  youth,  united  with  perpetual  sleep.     Of  one  so  gifted 

we  can  have  but  few  adventures  to  record.     Diana,  it  was  said, 

took  care  that  his  fortunes  should  not  suffer  by  his  inactive  life, 

for  she  made  his  flock  increase,  and  guarded  his  sheep  and  lambs 

from  the  wild  beasts. 

**The  sleeping  kine 
Couched  in  thy  brightness  dream  of  fields  divine." — Keats. 

The  story  of  Endymion  has  a  peculiar  charm  from  the  human 
meaning  which  it  so  thinly  veils.  We  see  in  Endymion  the 
young  poet,  his  fancy  and  his  heart  seeking  in  vain  for  that 
which  can  satisfy  them,  finding  his  favorite  hour  in  the  quiel 
moonlighl,  and  nursing  there,  beneath  the  beams  of  the  bright 
and  silent  witness,  the  melancholy  and  the  ardor  which  consumes 
him. 


ORION.  7^^. 

Dr.  Young  in  *' Night  Thoughts"  alludes  to  Endymion  thus  ;— 

**  These  thoughts,  O  Night,  are  thine  ; 
From  thee  they  came  like  lovers'  secret  sighs. 
While  others  slept." 

The  story  suggests  aspirii.g  and  poetic  love,  a  life  spent  more 
in  dreams  than  in  reality,  and  an  early  and  welcome  death. 

O-ri'on. 

O-ri'on  was  the  son  of  Neptune.  He  was  a  handsome  giant 
and  a  mighty  hunter.  His  father  gave  him  the  power  of 
wading  through  the  depths  of  the  sea,  or,  as  others  say,  of  walk- 
ing on  its  surface. 

Orion  loved  Merope,  the  daughter  of  CEnopion,  king  of 
Chios,  and  sought  her  in  marriage.  He  cleared  the  island  of 
wild  beasts,  and  brought  the  spoils  of  the  chase  as  presents  to 
his  beloved ;  but  as  QEnopion  constantly  deferred  his  consent, 
Orion  attempted  to  gain  possession  of  the  maiden  by  violence. 
Her  father,  incensed  at  this  conduct,  having  made  Orion  drunk, 
deprived  him  of  his  sight  and  cast  him  out  on  the  seashore.  The 
blinded  hero  followed  the  sound  of  a  Cyclops'  hammer  till  he 
reached  Lemnos,  and  came  to  the  forge  of  Vulcan,  who,  taking 
pity  on  him,  gave  him  Kedalion,  one  of  his  men,  to  be  his  guide 
to  the  abode  of  the  sun.  Placing  Kedalion  on  his  shoulders, 
Orion  proceeded  to  the  east,  and  there  meeting  the  sun -god,  was 
restored  to  sight  by  his  beam. 

**  When  blinded  by  QLnopion 

He  sought  the  blacksmith  at  his  forge, 
And  climbing  up  the  narrow  gorge. 
Fixed  his  blank  eyes  upon  the  sun." — Longfellow. 

After  this  he  dwelt  as  a  hunter  with  Diana,  with  whom  he  wp*' 
A  favorite,  and  it  is  even  said  she  was  about  to  marry  him. 

**  Queen  and  huntress,  chaste  and  fair, 
Now  the  Sun  is  laid  to  sleep. 
Seated  in  thy  silver  chair. 
State  in  wonted  manner  keep." — BE>f  JoNSON. 

Her  brother  was  highly  displeased  and  often  chid  her,  but  to 
no  purpose.     One   day,  observing  Orion  wading  through  the

sea  with  his  head  just  above  the  water,  Apollo  pointed  it  put  tl 


Diana  of  Ephesus, 

his  sister,  and  maintained  that  she  could  not  hit  that  black  thing 
on  the  sea.     The  archer-goddess  discharged  a  shaft  with  fatal

aim.  The  waves  rolled  the  dead  body  of  Orion  to  the  land  ;  and, 
bewailing  her  fatal  error  with  many  tears,  Diana  placed  him  among 
the  stars,  where  he  appears  as  a  giant,  with  a  girdle,  sword,  lion's 
skin  and  club.  Sirius,  his  dog,  follows  him,  and  the  Pleiades 
fly  before  him. 

Ple'ia-des, 

The  Ple'ia-des  were   daughters  of  Atlas,  and  nymphs   of 
Diana's  train. 

"  Many  a  night  T  saw  the  Pleiades,  rising  through  the  mellow  shade, 
Glitter  like  a  swarm  of  fire-flies  tangled  in  a  silver  braid." — TennysoN. 


Pleiades  (E.  Vedder). 

One  day  Orion  saw  them  and  became  enamored  and  pursued 
^hem.  In  their  distress  they  prayed  to  the  gods  to  change  their 
form,  and  Jupiter,  in  pity,  turned  them  into  pigeons,  and  then 
made  them  a  constellation  in  the  sky.  Though  their  number 
was  seven,  only  six  stars  are  visible,  for  Electra,  one  of  them, 
it  is  said,  left  her  place  that  she  might  not  behold  the  ruin  of 
Troy,  for  that  city  was  founded  by  her  son  Dardanus. 

"Like  the  lost  Pleiad  seen  no  more  below." — Byron. 

The  sight  had  such  an  effect  on  her  sisters  that  they  have 
iooked  pale  ever  since.

Au-ro'ra  and  Ti-tho'nus. 

'  The  goddess  of  the  Dawn,  like  her  sister  the  moon,  was  at 
times  inspired  with  the  love  of  mortals.  Her  greatest  favorite 
was  Ti-tho'nus,  son  of  Laomedon,  king  of  Troy.  She  stole 
him  away,  and  prevailed  on  Jupiter  to  grant  him  immortality  ; 
but  forgetting  to  have  youth  joined  in  the  gift,  after  some  time 
she  began  to  discern,  to  her  great  mortification,  that  he  was 
growing  old. 

**  Alas,  for  this  gray  shadow,  once  a  man, 

So  glorious  in  his  beauty  and  thy  choice." — TennysoN,  Tithonus. 

When  his  hair  was  quite  white  she  left  his  society ;  but  he 
still  had  the  range  of  her  palace,  lived  on  ambrosial  food, 
and  was  clad  in  celestial  raiment.  At  length  he  lost  the  power 
of  using  his  limbs,  and  then  she  shut  him  up  in  his  chamber, 
whence  his  feeble  voice  might  at  times  be  heard.  Finally  she 
turned  him  into  a  grasshopper. 

Memnon  was  the  son  of  Au-ro'ra  and  Tithonus.  He  was 
king  of  the  Ethiopians,  and  dwelt  in  the  extreme  east,  on  the 
shore  of  Ocean.  He  came  with  his  warriors  to  assist  the  kindred 
of  his  father  in  the  war  of  Troy.  King  Priam  received  him  with 
great  honors,  and  listened  with  admiration  to  his  narrative  of  the 
wonders  of  the  ocean  shore. 

The  very  day  after  his  arrival,  Memnon,  impatient  of  repose, 
led  his  troops  to  the  field.  Antilochus,  the  brave  son  of  Nestor, 
fell  by  his  hand,  and  the  Greeks  were  put  to  flight,  when 
Achilles  appeared  and  restored  the  battle.  A  long  and  doubtful 
contest  ensued  between  him  and  the  son  of  Aurora.  At  length 
victory  declared  for  Achilles,  Memnon  fell,  and  the  Trojans  fled 
in  dismay.  . 

Aurora,  who  from  her  station  in  the  sky  had  viewed  with  appre- 
hension the  danger  of  her  son,  when  she  saw  him  fall  directed 
his  brothers  the  Winds  to  convey  his  body  to  the  banks  of  the- 
river  Esepus,  in  Paphlagonia.  In  the  evening  Aurora  came,  ac 
companied  by  the  Hours  and  the  Pleiades,  and  wept  and  lamented 
over  her  son.  Night,  in  sympathy  with  her  grief,  spread  the 
heaven  with  clouds ;  all  nature  mourned  for  the  off*spring  of  the 


ACIS  AND  OALATEA.  2$g 

Dawn.  The  Ethiopians  raised  his  tomb  on  the  banks  of  the 
stream  in  the  grove  of  the  Nymphs,  and  Jupiter  caused  the 
sparks  and  cinders  of  his  funeral  pile  to  be  turned  into  birds, 
which,  dividing  into  two  flocks,  fought  over  the  pile  till  they 
fell  into  the  flame.  Every  year  at  the  anniversary  of  his  death 
they  return  and  celebrate  his  obsequies  in  like  manner.  Aurora 
remains  inconsolable  for  the  loss  of  her  son.  Her  tears  still 
flow,  and  may  be  seen  at  early  morning  in  the  form  of  dewdrops 
on  the  grass. 

Unlike  most  of  the  marvels  of  ancient  mythology,  there  still 
exist  some  memorials  of  this.  On  the  banks  of  the  river  Nile, 
in  Egypt,  are  two  colossal  statues,  one  of  which  is  said  to  be 
the  statue  of  Memnon.  Ancient  writers  record  that  when  the 
first  rays  of  the  rising  sun  fall  upon  this  statue,  a  sound  is  heard 
to  issue  from  it  which  they  compare  to  the  snapping  of  a  harp- 
string.  There  is  some  doubt  about  the  identification  of  the  ex- 
isting statue  with  the  one  described  by  the  ancients,  and  the 
mysterious  sounds  are  still  more  doubtful.  Yet  there  are  not 
wanting  some  modern  testimonies  to  their  being  still  audible. 
It  has  been  suggested  that  sounds  produced  by  confined  air 
making  its  escape  from  crevices  or  caverns  in  the  rocks  may 
have  given  some  ground  for  the  story.  Sir  Gardner  Wilkinson, 
a  late  traveller,  of  the  highest  authority,  examined  the  statue 
itself,  and  discovered  that  it  was  hollow,  and  that  **in  the  lap 
of  the  statue  is  a  stone,  which,  on  being  struck,  emits  a  metallic 
sound,  that  might  still  be  made  use  of  to  deceive  a  visitor  who 
was  predisposed  to  believe  its  powers. ' ' 

*'  So  to  the  sacred  Sun  in  Memnon' s  fane 
Spontaneous  concords  choired  the  matin  strain ; 
Touched  by  his  orient  beam  responsive  rings 
The  living  lyre  and  vibrates  all  its  strings  ; 
Accordant  aisles  the  tender  tones  prolong, 
And  holy  echoes  swell  the  adoring  song." — DarwiN, 

A'cis  and  Gal-a-te'a. 

Scylla  was  a  fair  virgin  of  Sicily,  a  favorite  of  the  Sea-Nymphs. 
She  had  many  suitors,  but  repelled  them  all,  and  would  go  to 
the  grotto  of  Gal-a-te'a,  and  tell  her  how  she  was  persecuted.  One 
day  the  goddess,  while  Scylla  dressed  her  hair,  listened  to  the 


afCO  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 

•r>tory,  and  then  replied,  **  Yet,  maiden,  your  persecutors  are  of 
the  not  ungentle  race  of  men,  whom,  if  you  will,  you  can  repel; 
but  I,  the  daughter  of  Nereus,  and  protected  by  such  a  band  of 
sisters,  found  no  escape  from  the  passion  of  the  Cyclops  but  in 
the  depths  of  the  sea;"  and  tears  stopped  her  utterance,  which, 
when  the  pitying  maiden  had  wiped  away  with  her  delicate 
finger,  and  soothed  the  goddess,  ''Tell  me,  dearest,"  said  she, 
**  the  cause  of  your  grief."  Galatea  then  said,  ''  A'cis  was  the 
son  of  Faunus  and  d  Naiad.  His  father  and  mother  loved  him 
dearly,  but  their  love  was  not  equal  to  mine.  For  the  beautiful 
youth  attached  himself  to  me  alone,  and  he  was  just  sixteen  years 
old,  the  down  just  beginning  to  darken  his  cheeks.  As  much  as 
I  sought  his  society,  so  much  did  the  Cyclops  seek  mine  ;  and  if 
you  ask  me  whether  my  love  for  Acis  or  my  hatred  of  Polyphe- 
mus was  the  stronger,  I  cannot  tell  you ;  they  were  in  equal 
measure.  O  Venus,  how  great  is  thy  power  !  this  fierce  giant, 
the  terror  of  the  woods,  whom  no  hapless  stranger  escaped  un- 
harmed, who  defied  even  Jove  himself,  learned  to  feel  what  love 
was,  and,  touched  with  a  passion  for  me,  forgot  his  flocks  and 
his  well-stored  caverns.  Then,  for  the  first  time,  he  began  to 
take  some  care  of  his  appearance,  and  to  try  to  make  himself 
agreeable ;  he  harrowed  those  coarse  locks  of  his  with  a  comb, 
and  mowed  his  beard  with  a  sickle,  looked  at  his  harsh  features 
in  the  water,  and  composed  his  countenance.  His  love  of 
slaughter,  his  fierceness  and  thirst  of  blood  prevailed  no  more, 
and  ships  that  touched  at  his  island  went  away  in  safety.  He 
paced  up  and  down  the  sea- shore,  imprinting  huge  tracks  with  his 
heavy  tread,  and,  when  weary,  lay  tranquilly  in  his  cave. 

**  Many  a  time 
Would  his  flocks  go  home  by  themselves  at  eve, 
Leaving  him  wasting  by  the  dark  sea-shore, 
And  sunrise  would  behold  him  wasting  still." 

— Theocritus  (Hunt's  tr.). 

"There  is  a  cliff  which  projects  into  the  sea,  which  washes  it 
on  either  side.  Thither,  one  day,  the  huge  Cyclops  ascended, 
and  sat  down  while  his  flocks  spread  themselves  around.  Laying 
down  his  staff,  which  would  have  served  for  a  mast  to  hold  a  ves- 
sel's sail,  and  taking  his  instrument  compacted  of  numerous 
pipes,   he  made  the  hills  and  the  waters  echo   <^be   music  of 


ACIS  A]^D  OALATEA.  261 

his  song.  I  lay  hid  under  a  rock  by  the  side  of  my  beloved  Acis, 
and  listened  to  the  distant  strain.  It  was  full  of  extravagant 
praises  of  my  beauty,  mingled  with  passionate  reproaches  of  my 
coldness  and  cruelty. 

**When  he  had  finished,  he  rose  up,  and  like  a  raging  bull 
that  cannot  stand  still,  wandered  off  into  the  woods.  Acis  and 
I  thought  no  more  of  him,  till  on  a  sudden  he  came  to  a  spot 
which  gave  him  a  view  of  us  as  we  sat.  *Isee  you,'  he  ex- 
claimed, 'and  I  will  make  this  the  last  of  your  love-meetings." 
His  voice  was  a  roar  such  as  an  angry  Cyclops  alone  could  utter. 
vEtna  trembled  at  the  sound.  I,  overcome  with  terror,  plunged 
into  the  water.  Acis  turned  and  fled,  crying,  '  Save  me,  Galatea ; 
save  me,  my  parents  !'  The  Cyclops  pursued  him,  and  tearing 
a  rock  from  the  side  of  the  mountain  hurled  it  at  him.  Though 
only  a  corner  of  it  touched  him,  it  overwhelmed  him. 

**  All  that  fate  left  in  my  power  I  did  for  Acis.  I  endowed 
him  with  the  honors  of  his  grandfather,  the  river-god.  The  pur- 
ple blood  flowed  out  from  under  the  rock,  but  by  degrees  grew 
paler  and  looked  like  the  stream  of  a  river  rendered  turbid  by 
rains,  and  in  time  it  became  clear.  The  rock  cleaved  open,  and 
the  water,  as  it  gushed  from  the  chasm,  uttered  a  pleasing  mur- 
mur. ' ' 

Thus  Acis  was  changed  into  a  river,  and  the  river  retains  the 
name  of  Acis.  This  river  takes  its  rise  at  the  foot  of  Mount 
^tna.  It  probably  received  its  name  from  the  Greek  word, 
meaning  arrow,  owing  to  the  swiftness  of  the  current.

CHAPTER  XXVII. 

The  Tro'jan  War. 

Minerva  was  the  goddess  of  wisdom,  but  on  one  occasion  she 
did  a  very  foolish  thing ;  she  entered  into  competition  with  Juno 
and  Venus  for  the  prize  of  beauty.  It  happened  thus :  At  the 
nuptials  of  Peleus  and  Thetis  all  the  gods  were  invited  with  the 
exception  of  Eris,  or  Discord. 

**  The  Abominable,  that  uninvited  came

Enraged  at  her  exclusion,  the  goddess  threw  a  golden  apple 
among   the    guests,   with   the    inscription,    *' For  the    fairest."

Thereupon  Juno,  Venus  and  Minerva  each  claimed  the  apple. 
Jupiter,  not  willing  to  decide  in  so  delicate  a  matter,  sent  the 
goddesses  to  Mount  Ida,  where  the  beautiful  shepherd  Paris  was 
tending  his  flocks,  and  to  him  was  committed  the  decision.  The 
goddesses  accordingly  ai)})eared  before  him.  Juno  promised  him 
power  and  riches,  Minerva  glory  and  renown  in  war,  and  Venus 
the  fairest  of  women  for  his  wife,  each  attempting  to  bias  his  de- 
cision in  her  own  favor.  Paris  decided  in  favor  of  Venus  and 
gave  her  the  golden  apple,  thus  making  the  other  two  goddesses 
his  enemies.

'  Under  the  protection  of  Venus,  Paris  sailed  to  Greece,  and 
was  hospitably  received  by  Menelaus,  king  of  Spartk;  Now 
Helen,  the  wife  of  Menelaus  and  the  tairest  of  her  sex,'  was  the 
very  one  whom  Venus  had  destined  for  Paris.  She  had  been 
sought  as  a  bride  by  numerous  suitors,  and  before  her  decision 
was  made  known,  they  all,  at  the  suggestion  of  Ulysses,  one  of 
their  number,  took  an  oath  that  they  would  defend  her  from  all 
injury  and  avenge  her  cause  if  necessary.  '''  • 

**  I  had  great  beauty ;  ask  thou  not  my  name  ;

She  chose  Menelaus,  and  was  living  with  him  happily  when 
Paris  became  their  guest.  Paris,  aided  by  Venus,  persuaded  her 
to  elope  with  him,  and  carried  her  to  Troy. 

**  Then  from  her  husband's  stranger- sheltering  home 
He  tempted  Helen  o'er  the  ocean  foam." 

— CoLUTHUS  (Elton's  tr.). 

Whence  arose  the  famous  Trojan  war,  the  theme  of  the  greatest 
poems  of  antiquity,  those  of  Homer  and  Virgil. 

Menelaus  called  upon  his  brother  chieftains  of  Greece  to  fulfil 
their  pledge,  and  join  him  in  his  efforts  to  recover  his  wife. 
They  generally  came  forward ;  but  Ulysses,  who  had  married 
Penelope  and  was  very  happy  in  his  wife  and  child,  had  no  dis- 
position to  embark  in  such  a  troublesome  affair.  He  therefore 
hesitated,  and  Palamedes  was  sent  to  urge  him.  When  Palamedes 
arrived  at  Ithaca,  Ulysses  pretended  to  be  mad.  He  yoked  ait 
ass  and  an  ox  together  to  the  plough  and  began  to  sow  salt. 
Palamedes,  to  try  him,  placed  the  infant  Telemachus  before  the 
plough,  whereupon  the  father  turned  the  plough  aside,  showing 
plainly  that  he  was  no  madman,  and  after  that  could  no  longer 
refuse  to  fulfil  his  promise.  Being  now  himself  gained  for  the 
undertaking,  he  lent  his  aid  to  bring  in  other  reluctant  chiefs, 
especially  Achilles,     This  hero  was  the  son  of  that  Thetis  at

She  sent  him  away  to  the  court  of  King  Lycomedes,  and  induced

guised  as  a  merchant  to  the  palace  and  offered  for  sale  female 
ornaments,  among  which  he  had  placed  some  arms.  While  the 
king's  daughters  were  engrossed  with  the  other  contents  of  the 
merchant's  pack  Achilles  handled  the  weapons,  and  thereby  be- 
trayed himself  to  the  keen  eye  of  Ulysses,  who  found  no  great 
difficulty  in  persuading  him  to  disregard  his  mother's  prudent 
counsels  and  join  his  countrymen  in  the  war.

Priam  was  king  of  Troy,  and  Paris,  the  shepherd  and  seduce? 
of  Helen,  was  his  son.  Paris  had  been  brought  up  in  obscurity, 
because  there  were  certain  ominous  forebodings  connected  with 
him  from  his  infancy  that  he  would  be  the  ruin  of  the  stivte. 
These  forebodings  seemed  at  length  likely  to  be  realized,  for  the 
Grecian  armament  now  in  preparation  was  the  greatest  that  had 
ever  been  fitted  out.  Agamemnon,  king  of  Mycenae,  and  brother 
of  the   injured    Menelaus,    was    chosen    commander-in-chief.

Achilles  was  their  most  illustrious  warrior.  After  him  ranked

Ulysses,  famous  for  his  sagacity  ;  and  Nestor,  the  oldest  of  the 
Grecian  chiefs,  and  one  to  whom  they  all  looked  up  for  counsel. 
But  Troy  was  no  feeble  enemy.  Priam,  the  king,  was  now  old ; 
but  he  had  been  a  wise  prince,  and  had  strengthened  his  state 
by  good  government  at  home  and  numerous  alliances  with  his 
neighbors.  But  the  principal  stay  and  support  of  his  throne 
was  his  son  Hector,  one  of  the  noblest  characters  painted  by 
heathen  antiquity.     He  felt,  from  the  first,  a  presentiment  of  the

After  two  years  of  preparation  the  Greek  fleet  and  army  as- 
sembled in  the  port  of  Aulis,  in  Boeotia.  Here  Agamemnon,  in 
hunting,  killed  a  stag  which  was  sacred  to  Diana,  and  the  god-

a  calm  which  prevented  the  ships  from  leaving  the  port.  Cab

on  her  altar,  and  that  none  other  but  the  daughter  of  the  offender 
would  be  acceptable.  Agamemnon,  however  reluctant,  yielded 
his  consent,  and  the  maiden  Iphigenia  was  sent  for  under  the 
pretence  that  she  was  to  be  married  to  Achilles.

When  she  was  about  to  be  sacrificed  the  goddess  relented  and 
snatched  her  away,  leaving  a  hind  in  her  place,  and  Iphigenia, 
enveloped  in  a  cloud,  was  carried  to  Tauris,  where  Diana  made

The  wind  now  proving  fair,  the  fleet  made  sail  and  brought  the

Hector.

TEE  ILIAD.  269 

The  Iliad. 

Th€  war  continued  without  decisive  results  for  nine  years, 
rhen  an  event  occurred  which  seemed  likely  to  be  fatal  to  the 
cause  of  the  Greeks,  and  that  was  a  quarrel  between  Achilles 
and  Agamemnon.  It  is  at  this  point  that  the  great  poem  of 
Homer,  the  Il'i-ad,  begins.  The  Greeks,  though  unsuccessful 
against  Troy,  had  taken  the  neighboring  and  allied  cities,  and 
in  the  division  of  the  spoils  a  female  captive,  by  name  Chrj'seis, 
daughter  of  ChrA'ses,  priest  of  Apollo,  had  fallen  to  the  share  of 
Agamemnon.  Chryses  came  bearing  the  sacred  emblems  of  his 
office,  and  begged  the  release  of  his  daughter.  Agamemnon  re- 
fused. Thereupon  Chryses  implored  Apollo  to  afflict  the  Greeks 
till  they  should  be  forced  to  yield  their  prey.  Apollo  granted 
the  player  of  his  priest,  and  sent  pestilence  into  the  Grecian 

camp. 

*'  The  people  of  the  camp 
Were  perishi  ng  in  heaps. "  —  H  OMER  (  Bryant' s  tr. ) . 

Then  a  council  was  called  to  deliberate  how  to  allay  the  wrath 
of  the  gods  and  avert  the  plague.  Achilles  boldly  charged  their 
misfortunes  upon  Agamemnon  as  caused  by  his  withholding 
Chryseis.  Agamemnon,  enraged,  consented  to  relinquish  his  cap- 
tive, but  demanded  that  Achilles  should  yield  to  him  in  her 
stead  Briseis,  a  maiden  who  had  fallen  to  Achilles'  share  in  the 
division  of  the  spoil.  Achilles  submitted,  but  forthwith  de- 
clared  that  he  would  take  no  further  part  in  the  war.  He  with- 
drew his  forces  from  the  general  camp  and  openly  avowed  his  in* 
tention  of  returning  home  to  Greece. 

"The  great  Achilles,  swift  of  foot,  remained 
Within  his  ships,  indignant  for  the  sake 
Of  the  fair-haired  Briseis." — HoMER  (Bryant's  tr.). 

The  gods  and  goddesses  interested  themselves  as  much  in  this 
famous  war  as  the  parties  themselves.  It  was  well  knov\Ti  to 
them  that  fate  had  decreed  that  Trov  should  fall,  at  last,  if  her 
enemies  should  persevere  and  not  voluntarily  abandon  the  enter- 
prise. Yet  there  was  room  enough  left  for  chance  to  excite  by 
turns  the  hopes  and  fears  of  the  powers  above  who  took  part 
with  either  side.     Juno  and  Miner\a,  in  consequence  of  the

slight  put  upon  their  charms  by  Paris,  were  hostile  to  the  Tro* 
jans ;  Venus,  for  the  opposite  cause,  favored  them.  Venus  en- 
listed her  admirer  Mars  on  the  same  side,  but  Neptune  favored 
the  Greeks.  Apollo  was  neutral,  sometimes  taking  one  side, 
sometimes  the  other ;  and  Jove  himself,  though  he  loved  the  good 
King  Priam,  yet  exercised  a  degree  of  impartiality ;  not,  how- 
ever, without  exceptions. 

Thetis,  the  mother  of  Achilles,  warmly  resented  the  injury 
done  to  her  son.  She  repaired  immediately  to  Jove's  palace  and. 
besought  him  to  make  the  Greeks  repent  of  their  injustice  to 
Achilles  by  granting  success  to  the  Trojan  arms. 

**  O  Father  Jove,  if  ever  I  have  aided  thee. 
Grant  but  this  one  desire." — Iliad. 

Jupiter  consented  ;  and  in  the  battle  which  ensued  the  Trojans 
were  completely  successful.  The  Greeks  were  driven  from  the 
field  and  took  refuge  in  their  ships. 

Then  Agamemnon  called  a  council  of  his  wisest  and  bravest 
chiefs.  Nestor  advised  that  an  embassy  should  be  sent  to  Achil- 
les to  persuade  him  to  return  to  the  field ;  that  Agamemnon 
should  yield  the  maiden,  the  cause  of  the  dispute,  with  ample 
gifts  to  atone  for  the  wrong  he  had  done.  Agamemnon  con- 
sented, and  Ulysses,  Ajax  and  Phoenix  were  sent  to  carry  to 
Achilles  the  penitent  message.  They  performed  that  duty,  but 
Achilles  was  deaf  to  their  entreaties.  He  positively  refused  to 
return  to  the  field,  and  persisted  in  his  resolution  to  embark  for 
Greece  without  delay. 

The  Greeks  had  constructed  a  rampart  around  their  ships,  and 
now,  instead  of  besieging  Troy,  they  were  in  a  manner  besieged 
themselves,  within  their  rampart.  The  next  day,  after  the  un- 
successful embassy  to  Achilles,  a  battle  was  fought,  and  the  Tro- 
jans, favored  by  Jove,  were  successful,  and  succeeded  in  forcing 
a  passage  through  the  Grecian  rampart,  and  v/ere  about  to  set 
fire  to  the  ships.  Neptune,  seeing  the  Greeks  so  pressed,  came  to 
their  rescue.  He  appeared  in  the  form  of  Calchas  the  prophet, 
encouraged  the  warriors  with  his  shouts,  and  appealed  to  each 
individually  till  he  raised  their  ardor  to  such  a  pitch  that  they 
forced  the  Trojans  to  give  way.  Ajax  performed  prodigies  of 
ralor,  and  at  length  encountered  Hector.     Ajax  shouted  defi-

ance,  to  which  Hector  replied,  and  hurled  his  lance  at  the  huge 

warrior. 

*•  This  indeed  is  Ajax, 
The  bulwark  of  the  Greeks." — Iliad. 

It  was  well  aimed,  and  struck  Ajax  where  the  belts  that  bore 
his  sword  and  shield  crossed  each  other  on  his  breast.  The 
double  guard  prevented  its  pene- 
rating,  and  it  fell  harmless.  Then 
Ajax,  seizing  a  huge  stone,  one  of 
those  that  served  to  prop  the  ships, 
hurled  it  at  Hector.  It  struck  him 
in  the  neck  and  stretched  him  on 
the  plain.  His  followers  instantly- 
seized  him  and  bore  him  off,  stunned 
and  wounded. 

While  Neptune  was  thus  aiding 
the  Greeks  and  driving  back  the 
Trojans,  Jupiter  saw  nothing  of  what 
was  going  on,  for  his  attention  had 
been  drawn  from  the  field  by  the 
wiles  of  Juno.  That  goddess  had 
arrayed  herself  in  all  her  charms, 
and  to  crown  all  had  borrowed  of 
Venus  her  girdle,  called  a  cestus, 
which  had  the  effect  of  heightening 
the  wearer's  charms  to  such  a  de- 
gree that  they  were  quite  irresistible. 
So  prepared,  Juno  went  to  join  her 
husband,  who  sat  on  Olympus 
watching  the  battle.  When  he  be- 
held her  she  looked  so  charming 
chat  the  fondness  of  his  early  love 

revived,  and,  forgetting  the  contending  armies  and  all  other 
affairs  of  state,  he  thought  only  of  her  and  let  the  battle  go  as  it 
would. 

But  this  absorption  did  not  continue  long,  and  when,  upon 
turning  his  eyes  downward,  he  beheld  Hector  stretched  on  the 
plain  almost  lifeless  from  pain  and  bruises,  he  dismissed  Juno  ii 
<  rage,  commanding  her  to  send  Iris  and  Apollo  to  him.

**  Haste,  Iris,  fleet  of  wing,  and  bear  my  words 
To  Hector." — Iliad  (Bryant). 

When  Iris  came,  he  sent  her  with  a  stern  message  to  Neptune, 
ordering  him  instantly  to  quit  the  field.  Apollo  was  despatched 
to  heal  Hector's  bruises  and  to  inspirit  his  heart.  These  orders 
were  obeyed  with  such  speed  that  while  the  battle  still  raged 
Hector  returned  to  the  field  and  Neptune  betook  himself  to  his 
own  dominions. 

An  arrow  from  Paris' s  bow  wounded  Machaon,  son  of  ^scu- 
lapius,  who  inherited  his  father's  art  of  healing,  and  was  there- 
fore of  great  value  to  the  Greeks  as  their  surgeon,  besides  being 
one  of  their  bravest  warriors.  Nestor  took  Machaon  in  his  chariot 
and  conveyed  him  from  the  field.  As  they  passed  the  ships  of 
Achilles,  that  hero,  looking  out  over  the  field,  saw  the  chariot  of 
Nestor  and  recognized  the  old  chief,  but  could  not  discern  who 
the  wounded  chief  was.  So  calling  Patroclus,  his  companion 
and  dearest  friend,  he  sent  him  to  Nestor's  tent  to  inquire. 

*•  Seen  from  behind 
His  form  was  like  Machaon — wholly  like 
That  son  of  ^sculapius." — Homer  (Bryant). 

Patroclus,  arriving  at  Nestor's  tent,  saw  Machaon  wounded, 
an<l  having  told  the  cause  of  his  coming  would  have  hastened 
away,  but  Nestor  detained  him,  to  tell  him  the  extent  of  the 
Grecian  calamities.  He  reminded  him  also  how,  at  the  time  of 
departing  for  Troy,  Achilles  and  himself  had  been  charged  by 
their  respective  fathers  with  different  advice  :  Achilles  to  aspire 
to  the  highest  pitch  of  glory  ;  Patroclus,  as  the  elder,  to  keep 
watch  over  his  friend,  and  to  guide  his  inexperience.  **  Now," 
said  Nestor,  "isthe  time  for  such  influence.  If  the  gods  so 
please,  thou  mayest  win  him  back  to  the  common  cause ;  but  if 
not,  let  him  at  least  send  his  soldiers  to  the  field  ;  and  come  thou,

A  respite  from  the  conflict." — Homer  (Bryant's  tr.), 

Patroclus  was  strongly  moved  by  this  address,  and  hastened 
back  to  Achilles,  revolving  in  his  mind  all  he  had  seen  and  heard. 
He  iold  the  prince  the  sad  con- 
dition of  affairs  at  the  camp  of 
their  late  associates  ;  Diomede, 
Ulysses,  Agamemnon,  Macha- 
on,  all  wounded,  the  rampart 
broken  down,  the  enemy  among 
the  ships  preparing  to  burn 
them,  and  thus  to  cut  off  all 
means  of  return  to  Greece. 
While  they  spoke  the  flames 
burst  forth  from  one  of  the 
ships.  Achilles,  at  the  sight, 
relented  so  far  as  to  grant  Pa- 
troclus his  request  to  lead  the 
Myrmidons  (for  so  were  Achil- 
les' soldiers  called)  to  the  field, 
and  to  lend  him  his  armor,  that 
he  might  thereby  strike  more 
terror  into  the  minds  of  the 
Trojans.  Without  delay  the 
soldiers  were  marshalled,  Patro- 
clus put  on  the  radiant  armor 
and  mounted  the  chariot  of 
Achilles,  and  led  forth  the  men, 
ardent  for  battle.     But  before  he

went,  Achilles  strictly  charged  him  that  he  should  be  content 
with  repelling  the  foe.  **Seek  not,"  said  he,  **to  press  the 
Trojans  without  me,  lest  thou  add  still  more  to  the  disgrace 
already  mJne. ' '  Then  exhorting  the  troops  to  do  their  best  he 
dismissed  them,  full  of  ardor,  to  the  fight. 

Patroclus  and  his  Myrmidons  at  once  plunged  into  the  contest 
where  it  raged  hottest,  at  the  sight  of  which  the  joyful  Gre-

cians  shouted  and  the  ships  reechoed  the  acclaim.  The  Trojans, 
at  the  sight  of  the  well-known  armor,  struck  with  terror,  looked 
everywhere  for  refuge.  First  those  who  had  got  possession  of 
the  ship  and  set  it  on  fire  left  and  allowed  the  Grecians  to  retake 
it  and  extinguish  the  flames.  Then  the  rest  of  the  Trojans  fled 
in  dismay.

Ajax,  Menelaus  and  the  two  sons  of  Nestor  performed  prodi- 
gies of  valor.  Hector  was  forced  to  turn  his  horses'  heads  and 
retire  from  the  enclosure,  leaving  his  men  entangled  in  the  fosse 
to  escape  as  they  could.  Patroclus  drove  them  before  him.  slay- 
ing many,  none  daring  to  make  a  stand  against  him. 

At  last  Sarpedon,  son  of  Jove,  ventured  to  oppose  himself  in 
fight  to  Patroclus.  Jupiter  looked  down  upon  him  and  would 
have  snatched  him  from  the  fate  which  awaited  him,  but  Juno 
hinted  that  if  he  did  so  it  would  induce  all  others  of  the  inhabi- 
tants of  heaven  to  interpose  in  like  manner  whenever  any  of  their 
offspring  were  endangered  ;  to  which  reason  Jove  yielded.  Sar- 
pedon threw  his  spear  but  missed  Patroclus,  but  Patroclus  threw 
his  with  better  success.  It  pierced  Sarpedon' s  breast  and  he 
fell,  and,  calling  to  his  friends  to  save  his  body  from  the  foe,  ex< 
pired.  Then  a  furious  contest  arose  for  the  possession  of  the 
corpse.  The  Greeks  succeeded  and  stripped  Sarpedon  of  his 
armor ;  but  Jove  would  not  allow  the  remains  of  his  son  to  be 
dishonored,  and  by  his  command  Apollo  snatched  from  the  midst 
of  the  combatants  the  body  of  Sarpedon  and  committed  it  to  the 
care  of  the  twin  brothers  Death  and  Sleep,  by  whom  it  was  trans- 
ported to  Lycia,  the  native  land  of  Sarpedon,  where  it  received 
due  funeral  rites.

And  kinsmen  give  him  burial,  and  shall  rear 
His  tomb  and  column — honors  due  the  dead."

Thus  far  Patroclus  had  succeeded  to  his  utmost  wish  in  repel- 
ling the  Trojans  and  relieving  his  countrymen  ;  but  now  came  a 
change  of  fortune.  Hector,  borne  in  his  chariot,  confronted 
him.     Patroclus  threw  a  vast  stone  at  Hector,  which  missed  iti

the  car.  Hector  leaped  from  the  chariot  to  rescue  his  friend, 
and  Patroclus  also  descended  to  complete  his  victory.  Thus  the 
two  heroes  met  face  to  face.  At  this  decisive  moment  the  poet, 
as  if  reluctant  to  give  Hector  the  glory,  records  that  Phoebus 
took  part  against  Patroclus.     He  struck  the  helmet  from  his  head

and  the  lance  from  his  hand.  At  the  same  moment  an  obscure 
Trojan  wounded  him  in  the  back,  and  Hector,  pressing  forward, 
pierced  him  with  his  spear.      Patroclus  fell  mortally  wounded.

Then  arose  a  tremendous  conflict  for  the  body  of  Patroclus  j 

but  his  armor  was  at  once  taken  possession  of  by  Hector,  who, 

retiring  a  short  distance,  divested  himself  of  his  own  armor  and 

put  on  that  of  Achilles,  then  returned  to  the  fight.     Ajax  and 

Menelaus  defended  the  body,  and  Hector  and  his  bravest  warriors 

struggled  to  capture  it. 

"  Patroclus  lies 
A  naked  corpse,  and  over  it  the  hosts 
Are  fighting." — Iliad  (Bryant). 

The  battle  raged  with  equal  fortunes,  when  Jove  enveloped  the 
whole  face  of  heaven  with  a  dark  cloud.  The  lightning  flashed, 
the  thunder  roared,  and  Ajax,  looking  around  for  some  one 
whom  he  might  despatch  to  Achilles  to  tell  him  of  the  death  of 
his  friend  and  of  the  imminent  danger  that  his  remains  would 
fall  into  the  hands  of  the  enemy,  could  see  no  suitable  messenger. 
Then  he  prayed  :  — 

* '  Lord  of  earth  and  air ! 
O  king  !  O  father  !  hear  my  humble  prayer  I 
Dispel  this  cloud,  the  light  of  heaven  restore  ; 
Give  me  to  see  and  Ajax  asks  no  more. 
If  Greece  must  perish  we  thy  will  obey. 
But  let  us  perish  in  the  face  of  day." — Pope. 

Jupiter  heard  the  prayer  and  dispersed  the  clouds.  Then  Ajax 
sent  Antilochus  to  Achilles  with  the  intelligence  of  Patroclus' s 
death,  and  of  the  conflict  raging  for  his  remains.  The  Greeks 
at  last  succeeded  in  bearing  off  the  body  to  the  ships,  closely 
oursued  by  Hector  and  ^neas  and  the  rest  of  the  Trojans. 

Achilles  heard  the  fate  of  his  friend  with  such  distress  that 
Antilochus  feared  for  a  while  that  he  would  destroy  himself.  His 
groans  reached  the  ears  of  his  mother,  Thetis,  far  down  in  the 
depths  of  ocean,  where  she  abode,  and  she  hastened  to  him  to  in- 
quire the  cause.  She  found  him  overwhelmed  with  self-reproach 
that  he  had  indulged  his  resentment  so  far,  and  suffered  his  friend 
to  fall  a  victim  to  it.     But  his  only  consolation  was  the  hope  of 

revenge.

He  consented,  and  Thetis  immediately  repaired  to  Vulcan's

own  use,  so  artfully  constructed  that  they  moved  forward  of  theif 
own  accord  when  wanted,  and  retired  again  when  dismissed.

On  hearing  the  request  of  Thetis,  Vulcan  immediately  laid 
aside  his  work  and  hastened  to  comply  with  her  wishes.  He 
fabricated  a  splendid  suit  of  armor  for  Achilles — first  a  shield 
adorned  with  elaborate  devices,  then  a  helmet  crested  with  gold, 
then  a  corselet  and  greaves  of  impenetrable  temper,  all  perfectly 
adapted  to  his  form  and  of  consummate  workmanship.  It  was  all 
done  in  one  night,  and  Thetis,  receiving  it,  descended  with  it  to 
earth  and  laid  it  down  at  Achilles'  feet  at  the  dawn  of  day. 

"And  now  receive 
This  sumptuous  armor,  forged  by  Vulcan's  hand,  ! 

Beautiful,  such  as  no  man  ever  wore.*'— Homer  (Bryant's  tr.).i 

I 
The  first  glow  of  pleasure  that  Achilles  had  felt  since  the  death 

of  Patroclus  was  at  the  sight  of  this  splendid  armor.  And  now,  | 
arrayed  in  it,  he  went  forth  into  the  camp,  calling  all  the  chiefs 
to  council.  When  they  were  all  assembled  he  addressed  them.; 
Renouncing  his  displeasure  against  Agamemnon  and  bitterly: 
lamenting  the  miseries  that  had  resulted  from  it,  he  called  on' 
them  to  proceed  at  once  to  the  field.  Agamemnon  made  a  suit-; 
able  reply,  laying  all  the  blame  on  Ate,  the  goddess  of  discord  ;i 
and  thereupon  complete  reconcilement  took  place  between  the 
heroes.  ; 

Then  Achilles  went  forth  to  battle,  inspired  with  a  rage  and 
thirst  for  vengeance  that  made  him  irresistible.  The  bravest 
warriors  fled  before  him  or  fell  by  his  lance.  Hector,  cautioned 
by  Apollo,  kept  aloof;  but  the  god,  assuming  the  form  of  one 
of  Priam's  sons,  Lycaon,  urged  ^neas  to  encounter  the  ter- 
rible warrior.  <^neas,  though  he  felt  himself  unequal,  did  not 
decline  the  combat.  He  hurled  his  spear  with  all  his  force 
against  the  shield,  the  work  of  Vulcan.  It  was  formed  of  five 
metal  plates ;  two  were  of  brass,  two  of  tin,  and  one  of  gold. 
The  spear  pierced  two  thicknesses,  but  was  stopped  in  the  third. 
Achilles  threw  his  with  better  success.  It  pierced  through  the 
shield  of  -^^neas,  but  glanced  near  his  shoulder  and  made  no 
wound.  Then  ^neas  seized  a  stone,  such  as  two  men  of  mod- 
vat  times  could  hardly  lift,  and   was  about  to    throw  it,  and

Achilles,  with  sword  drawn,  was  about  to  rush  upon  him,  when 
Neptune,  who  looked  out  upon  the  contest,  moved  with  pity 
for  ^4£neas,  who  he  saw  would  surely  fall  a  victim  if  not  speedily 
rescued,  spread  a  cloud  between  the  combatants,  and  lifting 
^neas  from  the  ground,  bore  him  over  the  heads  of  warriors 
and  steeds  to  the  rear  of  the  battle.  Achilles,  when  the  mist 
cleared  away,  looked  round  in  vain  for  his  adversary,  and  ac 
knowledging  the  prodigy,  turned  his  arms  against  other  cham 
pions. 

**  T  cannot  think 
That  he  who  gladly  fled  from  death  will  find 
The  courage  to  encounter  me  again." — Iliad  (Bryant). 

But  none  dared  stand  before  him,  and  Priam,  looking  down 
from  his  city  walls,  beheld  his  whole 
army  in  full  flight  towards  the  city.  He 
gave  command  to  open  wide  the  gates 
to  receive  the  fugitives,  and  to  shut 
them  as  soon  as  the  Trojans  should  have 
passed,  lest  the  enemy  should  enter  like- 
wise. But  Achilles  was  so  close  in  pur- 
suit that  that  would  have  been  impossible 
if  Apollo  had  not,  in  the  form  of  Agenor, 
Priam's  son,  encountered  Achilles  for 
awhile,  then  turned  to  fly,  and  taken  the 
way  apart  from  the  city.  Achilles  pur- 
sued and  had  chased  his  supposed  victim 
far  from  the  walls,  when  Apollo  disclosed 
himself,  and  Achilles,  perceiving  how  he 
had  been  deluded,  gave  up  the  chase. 

But  when  the  rest  had  escaped  into 
the  town.  Hector  stood  without,  deter- 
mined to  await  the  combat.  His  old 
father  called  to  him  from  the  walls  and 
begged  him  to  retire  nor  tempt  the  en-

through,  but  slay  me  while  I  spoke. ' '     While  he  thus  ruminated. 
Achilles  approached,  terrible  as  Mars,  his  annor  flashing  lightning 
as  he  moved.     At  that  sight  Hector's  heart  failed  him  and  he  fled. 
Achilles  swiftly  pursued.     They  ran,  still  keeping  near  the  walls, 
till  they  had  thrice  encircled  the  city.     As  often  as  Hector  ap- 
proached the  walls  Achilles  intercepted  him  and  forced  him  to 
keep  out  in  a  wider  circle.   But  Apollo  sustained  Hector's  strength, 
and  would  not  let  him  sink  in  weariness.     Then  Pallas,  assuming 
the  form  of  Deiphobus,  Hector's  bravest  brother,  appeared  sud- 
denly at  his   side.      Hector  saw   him   with   delight,  and  thus 
strengthened,  stopped  his  flight  and  turned  to  meet  Achilles. 
Hector  threw  his  spear,  which  struck  the  shield  of  Achilles  and 
bounded  back.     He  turned  to  receive  another  from  the  hand  of 
Deiphobus,  but  Deiphobus  was  gone.     Then  Hector  understood 
his  doom  and  said,   **  Alas  !  it  is  plain  this  is  my  hour  to  die  ! 
r  thought  Deiphobus  at  hand,  but  Pallas  deceived  me,  and  he  is 
still  in  Troy.     But  I  will  not  fall  inglorious." 

**  My  time  has  come 
To  slay  or  be  among  the  dead."— I  LI  AD. 

So  saying  he  drew  his  falchion  from  his  side  and  rushed  at  once 
to  combat.  Achilles,  secured  behind  his  shield,  waited  the  ap- 
proach of  Hector.  When  he  came  within  reach  of  his  spear, 
Achilles,  choosing  with  his  eye  a  vulnerable  part  where  the  armor 
leaves  the  neck  uncovered,  aimed  his  spear  at  that  part,  and 
Hector  fell,  death-wounded,  and  feebly  said,  **  Spare  my  body  ! 
Let  my  parents  ransom  it,  and  let  me  receive  funeral  rites  from 
the  sons  and  daughters  of  Troy.*'  To  which  Achilles  replied, 
**  Dog,  name  not  ransom  nor  pity  to  me,  on  whom  you  have 
brought  such  dire  distress.  No  !  trust  me,  nought  shall  save  thy 
carcass  from  the  dogs.  Though  twenty  ransoms  and  thy  weight 
in  gold  were  ofl'ered,  I  will  refuse  it  all.** 

So  saying,  he  stripped  the  body  of  its  armor,  and  fastening  cords 
to  the  feet,  tied  them  behind  his  chariot,  leaving  the  body  to  trail 
along  the  ground.  Then  mounting  the  chariot  he  lashed  tha 
•teeds,  and  so  dragged  the  body  to  and  fro  before  the  city.

**  Who  saw  the  corse 
Of  slaughtered  Hector  at  the  victor's  car 
Whirled  round  the  walls." — Euripides. 

What  words  can  tell  the  grief  of  King  Priam  and  Queen 
Hecuba  at  this  sight !  His  people  could  scarce  restrain  the  old 
king  from  rushing  forth.  He  threw  himself  in  the  dust  and  be- 
sought them  each  by  name  to  give  him  way.     Hecuba's  distress 

vas  not  less  violent.     The  citizens  stood  round  them  weeping. 

The  sound  of  the  mourning  reached  the  ears  of  Andromache,  the 
wife  of  Hector,  as  she  sat  among  her  maidens  at  work,  and  antici- 
pating evil  she  went  forth  to  the  wall.  When  she  saw  the  sight 
there  presented  she  would  have  thrown  herself  headlong  from 
the  wall,  but  fainted  and  fell  into  the  arms  of  her  maidens.  Re- 
covering, she  bewailed  her  fate,  picturing  to  herself  her  country 
ruined,  herself  a  captive,  and  her  son  dependent  for  his  bread 
on  the  charity  of  strangers. 

When  Achilles  and  the  Greeks  had  taken  their  revenge  on  the 
killer  of  Patroclus  they  busied  themselves  in  paying  due  funeral 
rites  to  their  friend.  A  pile  was  erected,  and  the  body  burned 
with  due  solemnity  ;  and  then  ensued  games  of  strength  and  skill, 
chariot  races,  wrestling,  boxing,  and  archery.  Then  the  chiefs 
sat  down  to  the  funeral  banquet,  and  after  that  retired  to  rest. 
But  Achilles  neither  partook  of  the  feast  nor  of  sleep.  Cutting 
off  a  lock  of  his  hair  he  placed  it  in  the  dead  hand  of  Patroclus, 

saying : — 

**  And  now,  since  I  no  more 

Shall  see  my  native  land,  the  land  I  love, 

Let  the  slain  hero  bear  these  locks  away." — Iliad  (Bryant). 

The  recollection  of  his  lost  friend  kept  him  awake,  remember- 
ing their  companionship  in  toil  and  dangers,  in  battle  or  on  the 
perilous  deep.  Before  the  earliest  dawn  he  left  his  tent,  and 
joining  to  his  chariot  his  swift  steeds,  he  faster  ^d  Hector's  body 
to  be  dragged  behind.  Twice  he  dragged  him  round  the  tomb 
of  Patroclus,  leaving  him  at  length  stretched  in  the  dust.  But 
Apollo  would  not  permit  the  body  to  be  torn  or  disfigured  with 
all  this  abuse,  but  preserved  it  free  from  all  taint  or  defilement. 

While  Achilles  indulged  his  wrath  in  thus  disgracing  brave 
Hector,  Jupiter  in  pity  summoned  Thetis  to  his  presence.  He 
told  her  to  go  to  her  son  and  prevail  on  him  to  restore  the  body 
of  Hector  *^o  his  friends.     Then  Jupiter  sent  Iris  to  King  Priarn

Iris  delivered  her  message,  and  Priam  immediately  prepared 
to  obey.  He  opened  his  treasuries  and  took  out  rich  garments 
and  cloths,  with  ten  talents  in  gold  and  two  splendid  tripods,  and 
a  golden  cup  of  matchless  workmanship.  Then  he  called  to  hii 
sons,  and  bade  them  draw  forth  his  litter  and  place  in  it  the  va- 
rious articles  designed  for  a  ransom  to  Achilles.  When  all  was 
ready,  the  old  king  with  a  single  companion  as  aged  as  himself, 
Ihe  herald  Idaeus,  drove  forth  from  the  gates,  parting  there  with 
Hecuba  his  queen  and  all  his  friends^  who  lamented  him  as 
going  to  certain  death. 

But  Jupiter,  beholding  with  compassion  the  venerable  king, 
sent  Mercury  to  be  his  guide  and  protector.  Mercury,  assuming 
the  form  of  a  young  warrior,  presented  himself  to  the  aged 
couple  ;  and,  while  at  the  sight  of  him,  they  hesitated  whether  to 
fly  or  yield,  the  god  approached,  and,  grasping  Priam's  hand, 
offered  to  be  their  guide  to  Achilles'  tent.  Priam  gladly  ac- 
cepted his  offered  service,  and  he,  mounting  the  carriage,  as- 
sumed the  reins  and  soon  conveyed  them  to  the  tent  of  Achilles. 
Mercury's  wand  put  to  sleep  all  the  guards,  and  without  hinder- 
ance  he  introduced  Priam  into  the  tent  where  Achilles  sat,  at- 
tended by  two  of  his  warriors.  The  old  king  threw  himself  at 
the  feet  of  Achilles,  and  kissed  those  terrible  hands  which  had 
destroyed  so  many  of  his  sons. 

"Think  of  thy  father,  an  old  man  hke  me, 
God-like  Achilles  ;  on  the  dreary  verge 
Of  closing  life  he  stands,  and  even  now 
Has  none  to  shield  his  age 
From  war  and  disaster." — Iliad  (Bryant). 

**  Perhaps  even  now  some  neighbor  chief  oppresses  him,  and 
there  is  none  at  hand  to  succor  him  in  his  distress.  Yet  doubt 
less  knowing  that  Achilles  lives  he  still  rejoices,  hoping  that  one 
day  he  shall  see  thy  face  again.  But  no  comfort  cheers  me,

Achilles  was  not  only  a  brave  man  upon  the  field  of  battle,  but 
merciful  to  the  unfortunate  as  well.  These  words  moved  him 
until  he  wept,  remembering,  as  he  did,  by  turns,  his  absent  father 
and  his  lost  friend.  Touched  with  pity  by  the  sight  of  Priam's 
silver  locks  and  beard,  and  reaching  out  his  hand,  he  raised  him 
from  the  earth  and  said  : 

•  *  The  gods  ordain  the  lot 

Of  man  to  suffer.  Beside  Jove's  threshold 
stand 

Two  casks  of  gifts  for  men  —  one  cask 
contains 

The  evil,  one  the  good,  and  he  to  whom 

The  Thunderer  gives  them  mingled,  some- 
times falls 

Into  misfortune,  and  sometimes  crowned 

With  blessings.  But  the  man  to  whom  he 
gives 

The  evil  only,  stands  a  mark  exposed 

To  wrong  —  alike  unloved  by  gods  and 
men."  — Iliad  (Bryant). 

**  I  know,  Priam,  that  thou  hast 
reached  this  place  conducted  by 
some  god,  for  without  aid  divine  no 
mortal,  even  in  his  prime  of  youth, 
had  dared  the  attempt.  I  grant  thy 
request,  moved  thereto  by  the  evi- 
dent will  of  Jove."  So  saying  he 
arose,  and  went  forth  with  his  two 
friends,  and  unloaded  of  its  charge 
the  litter,  leaving  two  mantles  and 
a  robe  for  the  covering  of  the  body, 
which  they  placed  on  the  litter,  and 
spread  the  garments  over  it,  that 
not  unveiled  it  should  be  borne  back  Mercury 

to  Troy.      Then  Achilles  dismissed     (National  Museum,  Florence), 
the  old  king  with   his  attendants, 

having  first  pledged  himself  to  allow  a  truce  of  twelve  days  foi 
the  funeral  solemnities. 

As  the  litter  approached  the  city  and  was  descried  from  the 
walls,  the  people  poured  forth  to  gaze  once  more  on  the  face  of 
cheir  hero.     Foremost  of  all,  the  mother  and  the  wife  of  Hectoi

came,  and  at  the  sight  of  the  lifeless  body  renewed  their  lamenta- 
tions. The  people  all  wept  with  them,  and  to  the  going  down 
of  the  sun  there  was  no  pause  or  abatement  of  their  grief. 

The  next  day,  preparations  were  made  for  the  funeral  solemni' 
ties.  For  nine.days  the  people  brought  wood  and  built  the  pile, 
and  on  the  tenth  they  placed  the  body  on  the  summit  and  applied 
the  torch,  while  all  Troy,  thronging  forth,  encompassed  the 
pile.  When  it  had  completely  burned,  they  quenched  the  cin- 
ders with  wine,  collected  the  bones  and  placed  them  in  a  golden 
urn,  which  they  buried  in  the  earth,  and  reared  a  pile  of  stonea 
over  the  spot.

And  peaceful  slept  the  mighty  Hector's  shade.*'— PoPE.

CHAPTER  XXVIII. 

The  Fall  of  Troy — Return  of  the  Greeks — Ag-a-mem'» 
non,  O-res'tes  and  E-lec'tra. 

The  Fall  of  Troy. 

The  story  of  the  Iliad  ends  with  the  death  of  Hector,  and  it 
is  from  the  Odyssey  and  later  poems  that  we  learn  the  fate  of 
the  other  heroes.  After  the  death  of  Hector,  Troy  did  not  im- 
mediately fall,  but  receiving  aid  from  new  allies,  still  continued 
its  resistance.  One  of  these  allies  was  Memnon,  the  ^Ethiopian 
prince,  whose  story  we  have  already  told.  Another  was  Pen- 
thesilea,  queen  of  the  Amazons,  who  came  with  a  band  of  female 
warriors.  All  the  authorities  attest  their  valor  and  the  fearful 
effect  of  their  war-cry.  Penthesilea  slew  many  of  the  bravest 
warriors,  but  was  at  last  slain  by  Achilles.  But  when  the  hero 
bent  over  his  fallen  foe,  and  contemplated  her  beauty,  youth  and 
valor,  he  bitterly  regretted  his  victory.  Thersites,  an  insolent 
brawler  and  demagogue,  ridiculed  his  grief,  and  was  in  conse- 
quence slain  by  the  hero. 

Achilles  by  chance  had  seen  Polyxena,  daughter  of  King  Priam, 
perhaps  on  occasion  of  the  truce  which  was  allowed  the  Trojans 
for  the  burial  of  Hector.  He  was  captivated  with  her  charms, 
and  to  win  her  in  marriage  agreed  to  use  his  influence  with  the 
Greeks  to  grant  peace  to  Troy. 

*•  And  mirth  was  in  the  halls  of  Troy 
Before  her  towers  and  temples  fell ; 
High  pealed  the  choral  hymns  of  joy, 
Melodious  to  the  golden  shell. 
The  weary  hand  reposed  from  slaughter. 
The  eye  forgot  the  tear  it  shed, 
This  day  King  Priam's  lovely  daughter 
Shall  great  Pelides  wed." 
!  — Schiller's  Cassandra  (Hempd) 

While  in  the  temple  of  Apollo,  negotiating  the  marriage,  Paris 
discharged  at  him  a  poisoned  arrow,  which,  guided  by  the  god, 


286 


STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 


wounded  Achilles  in  the  heel,  the  only  vulnerable  part  about 
him  ;  for  Thetis,  his  mother,  had  dipped  him  when  an  infant  in 
the  river  Styx,  which  made  every  part  of  him  invulnerable  ex- 
cept the  heel  by  which  she  held  him.^ 

The  body  of  Achilles,  so  treacherously  slain,  was  rescued  by 
Ajax  and  Ulysses.  Thetis  directed .  the  Greeks  to  bestow  her 
son's  armor  on  the  hero  who  of  all  the  survivors  should  be  judged 

most  deserving  of  it.  Ajax  and 
Ulysses  were  the  only  claimants ; 
a  select  number  of  the  other  chiefs 
were  appointed  to  award  the  prize. 
It  was  awarded  to  Ulysses,  thus 
placing  wisdom  before  valor; 
whereupon  Ajax  slew  himself. 
On  the  spot  where  his  blood  sank 
into  the  earth  a  flower  sprang  up, 
called  the  hyacinth,  bearing  on 
its  leaves  the  first  two  letters  of 
the  name  of  Ajax — Ai,  the  Greek 
for  *Mvoe.**  Thus  Ajax  is  a 
claimant  with  the  boy  Hyacin- 
thus  for  the  honor  of  giving  birth 
to  this  flower.  There  is  a  species 
of  larkspur  which  represents  the 
hyacinth  of  the  poets  in  preserv- 
ing the  memory  of  this  event, 
the   Delphinium   Ajacis — Ajax's 

Ajax  (Vatican,  Rome).  ^      n 

It  was  now  discovered  that  Troy  could  not  be  taken  but  by  the 
aid  of  the  arrows  of  Hercules.  They  were  in  possession  of  Phil- 
octetes,  the  friend  who  had  been  with  Hercules  at  the  last  and 
lighted  his  funeral  pyre.  Philoctetes  had  joined  the  Grecian 
expedition  against  Troy,  but  had  accidentally  wounded  his  foot 
with  one  of  the  poisoned  arrows,  and  the  smell  from  his  wound 
proved  so  offensive  that  his  companions  carried  him  to  the  isle 
of  Lemnos,  and  left  him  there. 

*  The  story  of  the  invulnerability  of  Achilles  is  not  found  in  Homer,  and  is 
inconsistent  with  his  account.  For  how  could  Achilles  require  the  aid  of  cele»' 
tial  armor  if  he  were  invulnerable  ? 


THE  FALL  OF  TROY,  287 

••  The  tenth  sad  year  now  rolls  its  course 
Since  here,  with  wretchedness  and  famine  pierced, 
I  waste  away  and  feed  ray  rankling  wound." 

— Sophocles  (Philoctetes). 

!  Diomedes  was  now  sent  to  induce  him  to  rejoin  the  army.  He 
succeeded.  Philoctetes  was  cured  of  his  wound  by  Machaon, 
and  Paris  was  the  first  victim  of  the  fatal  arrows.  In  his  distres. 
Paris  bethought  him  of  one  whom  in  his  prosperity  he  had  for- 
gotten. This  was  the  nymph  CEnone,  whom  he  had  married 
when  a  youth,  and  had  abandoned  for  the  fatal  beauty  Helen. 
CEnone,  remembering  the  wrongs  she  had  suffered,  refused  to 
heal  the  wound,  and  Paris  went  back  to  Troy  and  died.  CEnone 
quickly  repented,  and  hastened  after  him  with  remedies,  but 
came  too  late,  and  in  her  grief  hung  herself. 

** Hither  came  at  noon 

Mournful  CEnone,  wandering  forlorn 

Of  Paris,  once  her  playmate  on  the  hills. 

Her  cheek  had  lost  the  rose,  and  round  her  neck 

Floated  her  hair,  or  seemed  to  float  in  rest. 

She,  leaning  on  a  fragment  twined  with  vine, 

Sang  to  the  stillness,  till  the  mountain- shade 

Sloped  downward  to  her  seat  from  the  upper  cliff." — TENNYSON, 

There  was  in  Troy  a  celebrated  statue  of  Minerva  called  the 
Palladium.  It  was  said  to  have  fallen  from  heaven,  and  the  be- 
lief was  that  the  city  could  not  be  taken  so  long  as  this  statue  re' 
mained  within  it.  Ulysses  and  Diomed  entered  the  city  in  dis- 
guise and  succeeded  in  obtaining  the  Palladium,  which  they 
carried  off  to  the  Grecian  camp. 

But  Troy  still  held  out,  and  the  Greeks  began  to  despair  of 
ever  subduing  it  by  force,  and  by  advice  of  Ulysses  resolved  to 
resort  to  stratagem.  They  pretended  to  be  making  preparations 
to  abandon  the  siege,  and  a  portion  of  the  ships  were  withdrawn 
and  lay  hid  behind  a  neighboring  island.  The  Greeks  then  con- 
structed an  immense  wooden  horse,  which  they  gave  out  was  in^ 
tended  as  a  propitiatory  offering  to  Minerva,  but  in  fact  was  filled 
with  armed  men.  The  remaining  Greeks  then  betook  them- 
selves to  their  ships  and  sailed  away,  as  if  for  a  final  departure. 
The  Trojans,  seeing  the  encampment  broken  up  and  the  fleet 
gone,  concluded  that  the  enemy  had  abandoned  the  siege.     The 


2SS  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 

gates  were  thrown  open,  and  the  whole  population  issued  forth, 
rejoicing  at  the  long-prohibited  liberty  of  passing  freely  over  the 
scene  of  the  late  encampment.  The  great  horse  was  the  chief 
object  of  curiosity.  All  wondered  what  it  could  be  for.  Some 
recommended  to  take  it  into  the  city  as  a  trophy  ;  others  felt 
afraid  of  it. 

While  they  hesitate,  Laocoon,  the  priest  of  Neptune,  exclaims, 
"  What  madness,  citizens,  is  this !  Have  you  not  learned 
enough  of  Grecian  fraud  to  be  on  your  guard  against  it  ?  For 
my  part,  I  fear  the  Greeks,  even  when  they  offer  gifts."* 

*'  What  madness,  citizens, 
Is  this  ?     Believe  ye  then  our  foes  are  gone  ? 

Either  the  Greeks 
Within  this  wooden  fabric  are  concealed, 
Or  it  is  framed  to  bear  against  our  walls. 

I  fear  the  Greeks, 
Even  when  they  bring  us  gifts.*' — Virgil,  Book  II  (Cranch). 

So  saying,  he  threw  his  lance  at  the  horse's  side.  It  struck, 
and  a  hollow  sound  reverberated  like  a  groan.  Then,  perhaps, 
the  people  might  have  taken  his  advice  and  destroyed  the  fatal 
horse  and  all  its  contents ;  but  just  at  that  moment  a  group  of 
people  appeared  dragging  forward  one  who  seemed  a  prisoner 
and  a  Greek.  Stupefied  with  terror  he  was  brought  before  the 
chiefs,  who  reassured  him,  promising  that  his  life  should  be 
spared  on  condition  of  his  returning  true  answers  to  the  questions 
asked  him.  He  informed  them  that  he  was  a  Greek,  Sinon  by 
name,  and  that  in  consequence  of  the  malice  of  Ulysses  he  had 
been  left  behind  by  his  countrymen  at  their  departure.  With 
regard  to  the  wooden  horse,  he  told  them  that  it  was  a  propitia- 
tory offering  to  Minerva,  and  made  so  huge  for  the  express  pur- 
pose of  preventing  its  being  carried  within  the  city  ;  for  Calchas 
the  prophet  had  told  them  that  if  the  Trojans  took  possession 
of  it,  they  would  assuredly  triumph  over  the  Greeks.  This  lan- 
guage turned  the  tide  of  the  people's  feelings,  and  they  began 
to  think  how  they  might  best  secure  the  monstrous  horse  and 
the  favorable  auguries  connected  with  it,  when  suddenly  a 
prodigy  occurred  which  left  no  room  to  doubt.     There  appeared

advancing  over  the  sea  two  immense  serpents.    They  came  upon 

the  land,  and  the  crowd  fled  in  all  directions.     The  serpents 

advanced  directly  to  the  spot  where  Laocoon  stood  with  his  two 

sons. 

**  Two  snakes 

Came  gliding  on  the  deep  with  rings  immense, 

Pressing  upon  the  sea,  and  side  by  side 

Toward  the  shore  they  move  with  necks  erect 

And  bloody  crests  that  tower  above  the  waves  ; 

A  noise  of  foaming  brine  is  heard, 

They  reach  the  shore,  their  burning  eyes  suffused 

With  blood  and  fire,  and  lick  their  hissing  mouths 

With  quivering  tongues." — Virgil,  Book  II  (Cranch). 

They  first  attacked  the  children,  winding  round  their  bodies 
and  breathing  their  pestilential  breath  in  their  faces.  The  father, 
attempting  to  rescue  them,  is  next  seized  and  involved  in  the 
serpents*  coils.  He  struggles  to  tear  them  away,  but  they  over- 
power all  his  efforts  and  strangle  him  and  the  children  in  their 

poisonous  folds. 

"Onward  it  moves, 
And  threatening  glides  into  the  city's  midst." — Virgil. 

This  e  /ent  was  regarded  as  a  clear  indication  of  the  displeas- 
ure of  the  gods  at  Laocoon's  irreverent  treatment  of  the  wooden 
horse,  which  they  no  longer  hesitated  to  regard  as  a  sacred  ob- 
ject and  prepared  to  introduce  with  due  solemnity  into  the  city. 
This  was  done  with  songs  and  triumphal  acclamations,  and  the 
day  closed  with  festivity. 

In  the  night  the  armed  men  who  were  enclosed  in  the  body 
of  the  horse,  being  let  out  by  the  traitor  Sinon,  opened  the 
gates  of  the  city  to  their  friends,  who  had  returned  under  cover 
of  darkness.  The  city,  sunk  in  sleep  and  wine,  fell  an  easy 
prey  to  the  invaders. 

King  Priam  lived  to  see  the  downfall  of  his  kingdom,  and  was 
'slain  at  last  on  the  fatal  night  when  the  Greeks  took  the  city. 
He  had  armed  himself  and  was  about  to  mingle  with  the  com- 
batants, but  was  prevailed  on  by  Hecuba,  his  aged  queen,  to  take 
refuge  with  herself  and  his  daughters  as  a  suppliant  at  the  altar 
of  Jupiter.  While  there,  his  youngest  son  Polites,  pursued  by 
Pyrrhus,  the  son  of  Achilles,  rushed  in  wounded,  and  expired  at 
the  feet  of  his  father;  whereupon  Priam,  overcome  with  indigna-

tion,  hurled  his  spear  with  feeble  hand  against  Pyrrhus,*  and  waii 
forthwith  slain  by  him. 

••  He  raised  his  sword,  and  to  the  hilt 
Buried  it  in  his  side." — Virgil. 

Queen  Hecuba  and  her  daughter  Cassandra  were  carried  cap' 
tives  to  Greece.  Cassandra  had  been  loved  by  Apollo,  and  he 
gave  her  the  gift  of  prophecy ;  but  afterwards  offended  with  her, 
he  rendered  the  gift  unavailing  by  ordaining  that  her  predictions 
should  never  be  beheved.  Polyxena,  another  daughter,  who  had 
been  loved  by  Achilles,  was  demanded  by  the  ghost  of  that  war- 
fior,  and  was  sacrificed  by  the  Greeks  upon  his  tomb. 

*•  The  Greeks  with  one  consent 
Resolve  that  on  the  tomb  of  Peleus'  soq 
Thou  shalt  be  sacrificed." — Sophocles. 

Men-e-la'us  and  Hel'en. 

Our  readers  will  be  anxious  to  know  the  fate  of  Heren,  the 
fair  but  guilty  occasion  of  so  much  slaughter.  On  the  fall  of 
Troy  Men-e-la'us  recovered  possession  of  his  wife,  who  had 
not  ceased  to  love  him,  though  she  had  yielded  to  the  might  of 
Venus  and  deserted  him  for  another.  After  the  death  of  Paris 
she  aided  the  Greeks  secretly  on  several  occasions,  and  in  par- 
ticular when  Ulysses  and  Diomedes  entered  the  city  in  disguise  to 
carry  off  the  Palladium.  She  saw  and  recognized  Ulysses,  but 
kept  the  secret,  and  even  assisted  them  in  obtaining  the  image. 
Thus  she  became  reconciled  to  her  husband,  and  they  were 
among  the  first  to  leave  the  shores  of  Troy  for  their  native  land. 
But  having  incurred  the  displeasure  of  the  gods,  they  were  driven 
by  storms  from  shore  to  shore  of  the  Mediterranean,  visiting 
Cyprus,  Phoenicia  and  Egypt.  In  Egypt  they  were  kindly  treated 
and  presented  with  rich  gifts,  of  which  Helenas  share  was  a  golden 
spindle  and  a  basket  on  wheels.  The  basket  was  to  hold  the  wool 
and  spools  for  the  queen* s  work. 

Menelaus  and  Helen  at  length  arrived  in  safety  at  Sparta,  re- 
sumed their  royal  dignity,  and  lived  and  reigned  in  splendor.

But  the  glory  of  the  olden  Trojan  days  had  gone  forever. 

**  The  son  of  Atreus,  king  of  men, 
The  muster  of  the  host  surveyed  ; 
How  dwindled  from  the  thousands,  when 
Along  Scamander  first  arrayed." — Schiller  (Hempel). 

When  Telemachus,  the  son  of  Ulysses,  arrived  at  Sparta,  in 
search  of  his  father,  he  found  Menelaus  and  Helen  celebrating 
the  marriage  of  their  daughter  Hermione  to  Neoptolemus,  son 
,of  Achilles. 

Ag-a-mem'non,  O-res'tes  and  F-lec'tra. 

Ag-a-mem'non,  the  general-in  chief  of  the  Greeks,  the 
brother  of  Menelaus,  and  who  had  been  drawn  into  the  quarrel 
to  avenge  his  brother's  wrongs,  not  his  own,  was  not  so  fortunate 
in  the  issue.  During  his  absence  his  wife  Clytemnestra  had  been 
false  to  him,  and  when  his  return  was  expected  she,  with  her 
paramour,  ^gisthus,  laid  a  plan  for  his  destruction,  and  at  the 
banquet  given  to  celebrate  his  return  murdered  him. 


<<  < 


^gisthus,  bent  upon  my  death, 
Plotted  against  me  with  my  guilty  wife. 
And  bade  me  to  his  house,  and  slew  me  there. 
Even  at  the  banquet.'  " — Homer  (Bryant's  tr.). 

It  was  intended  by  the  conspirators  to  slay  his  son  O-res'tes 
also,  a  lad  not  yet  old  enough  to  be  an  object  of  apprehension, 
but  from  whom,  if  he  should  be  suffered  to  grow  up,  there  might 
be  danger.  E-lec'tra,  the  sister  of  Orestes,  saved  her  brother's 
life  by  sending  him  secretly  away  to  his  uncle  Strophius,  King 
of  Phocis.  In  the  palace  of  Strophius  Orestes  grew  up  with  the 
King's  son  Pylades,  and  formed  with  him  that  ardent  friendship 
which  has  become  proverbial.  Electra  frequently  reminded  her 
brother  by  messengers  of  the  duty  of  avenging  his  father's  death, 
and  when  grown  up  he  consulted  the  oracle  of  Delphi,  which 
confirmed  him  in  his  design.  He  therefore  repaired  in  disguise 
to  Argos,  pretending  to  be  a  messenger  from  Strophius,  who  had 
come  to  announce  the  death  of  Orestes,  and  brought  the  ashes 
of  the  deceased  in  a  funeral  urn.  After  visiting  his  father's 
tomb  and  sacrificing  upon  it,  according  to  the  rites  of  the  ancients, 
he  made  himself  known  to  his  sister  Electra,  and  soon  after  slev 
both  ./Egisthus  and  Clytemnestra.

iSTOBIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES. 


**  The  accurst  ^gisthus 
Him  first  I  slew,  nor  sheathed  my  vengeful  sword 
Till  I  had  stained  it  with  maternal  gore.'* 

— Euripides  (Orestes). 

This  revolting  act,  the  slaughter  of  a  mother  by  her  son, 
though  alleviated  by  the  guilt  of  the  victim  and  the  express  com- 
mand of  the  gods,  did  not  fail  to  awaken  in  the  breasts  of  the 

ancients  the  same  abhor 
rence  that  it  does  in  ours. 
The  Eumenides,  avenging 
deities,  seized  upon  Ores- 
tes and  drove  him  frantic 
from  land  to  land.  Pylades 
accompanied  him  in  his 
wanderings  and  watched 
over  him.  At  length,  in 
answer  to  a  second  appeal 
to  the  oracle,  he  was  di- 
rected to  go  to  Tauris  in 
Scythia,  and  to  bring 
thence  a  statue  of  Diana 
which  was  believed  to 
have  fallen  from  heaven. 
Accordingly  Orestes  and 
Pylades  went  to  Tauris, 
where  the  barbarous  peo- 
ple were  accustomed  to 
sacrifice  to  the  goddess 
all  strangers  who  fell  into 
their  hands.  The  two 
friends  were  seized  and 
carried  bound  to  the  tem-

pie  to  be  made  victims.  But  the  priestess  of  Diana  was  no  other 
than  Iphigenia,  the  sister  of  Orestes,  who,  our  readers  will  re- 
member, was  snatched  away  by  Diana  at  the  moment  when  she 
was  about  to  be  sacrificed.  Ascertaining  from  the  prisoners  who 
they  were,  Iphigenia  disclosed  herself  to  them,  and  the  three 
made  their  escape  with  the  statue  of  fhe  goddess,  and  returned 
to  Mycenat.

But  Orestes  was  not  yet  relieved  from  the  vengeance  of  the 

Erinnyes. 

**  Methought 
I  saw  three  hideous  maids  arise  whose  looks 
Resemble  night." 

At  length  he  took  refuge  with  Minerva  at  Athens.  The  goddess 
afforded  him  protection,  and  appointed  the  court  of  Areopagus. 
to  decide  his  fate.  The  Erinnyes  brought  forward  their  accusa 
tion,  and  Orestes  made  the  command  of  the  Delphic  oracle  his 
excuse.  When  the  court  voted  and  the  voices  were  equally 
divided,  Orestes  was  acquitted  by  the  command  of  Minerva. 

•*  O  thou  who  never  yet  of  human  wrong 
Left  the  unbalanced  scale,  great  Nemesis  I 
Thou  who  didst  call  the  Furies  from  the  abyss, 
And  round  Orestes  bade  them  howl  and  hiss. 
For  that  unnatural  retribution, — ^just. 
Had  it  but  been  from  hands  less  near, — in  this. 
Thy  former  realm,  I  call  thee  from  the  dust  I** — Byron. 

One  of  the  most  pathetic  scenes  in  the  ancient  drama  is  that 
in  which  Sophocles  represents  the  meeting  of  Orestes  and  Elcctra 
on  his  return  from  Phocis.  Orestes,  mistaking  Electra  for  one 
of  the  domestics,  and  desirous  of  keeping  his  arrival  a  secret  till 
the  hour  of  vengeance  should  arrive,  produces  the  urn  in  which 
his  ashes  are  supposed  to  rest.  Electra,  believing  him  to  be 
really  dead,  takes  the  urn,  and,  embracing  it,  pours  forth  her 
grief  in  language  full  of  tenderness  and  despair. 

**  Thou  sad  memorial,  now  the  sole  remains 
Of  what  was  once  Orestes." — Sophocles  (Electra). 

It  is  said  that  on  one  occasion  the  city  of  Athens  was  at  the 
mercy  of  her  Spartan  foes,  and  it  was  proposed  to  destroy  it,  but 
the  thought  was  rejected  upon  the  accidental  quotation,  by  sonw 
one,  of  a  chorus  of  Euripides. 

•*  The  repeated  air 
Of  sad  Electra*s  poet  had  the  power 
To  save  the  Athenian  walls  from  ruin  bare.*'— «MlLTMf.

Return  of  U-lys'ses, 

The  romantic  poem  of  the  Odyssey  is  now  to  engage  oui 
attention.     It  narrates  the  wanderings  of  U-lys'ses  (Odysseus, 
in  the  Greek  language)  in  his  return  from  Troy  to  his  own  king 
lom,  Ithaca. 

From  Trov  the  vessels  first  made  land  at  Ismarus.  city  of  tb^ 


A  Reading  from  Homer  (.Alma  radema> 

Cicuuians,  where,  in  a  skirmish  with  the  inhabitants,  Ulysses 
lost  six  men  from  each  ship. 

**  Six  brave  companions  from  each  ship  we  lost ; 

The  rest  escape  in  haste  and  quit  the  coast." — HOMER  (Pope.) 

Sailing  thence,  they  were  overtaken  by  a  storm  which  drove 
them  for  nine  days  along  the  sea  till  they  reached  the  country 
of  the  Lotus-eaters.  Here,  after  watering,  Ulysses  sent  three 
of  his  men  to  discover  who  the  inhabitants  were.  These  men, 
on  commg  among  the  Lotus-eaters,  were  kindly  entertained  bj»

them,  and  were  given  some  of  their  own  food,  the  lotus-plant, 

to  eat.     The  effect  of  this  food  was  such  that  those  who  partook 

of  it  lost  all  thoughts  of  home  and  wished  to  remain  in  that 

country. 

'**  How  sweet  it  were,  hearing  the  downward  stream. 
With  half- shut  eyes  ever  to  seem 
Falling  asleep  in  a  half-dream  1 
,  To  dream  and  dream,  like  yonder  amber  light 

Which  will  not  leave  the  myrrh-bush  on  the  height  | 

To  hear  each  others'  whispered  speech ; 

Eating  the  Lotos,  day  by  day. 

To  watch  the  crisping  ripples  on  the  beach. 

And  tender  curving  lines  of  creamy  spray ; 

To  lend  our  hearts  and  spirits  wholly 

To  the  influence  of  mild-minded  melancholy ; 

To  muse  and  brood  and  live  again  in  memory. 

With  those  old  faces  of  our  infancy 

Heaped  over  with  a  mound  of  grass, 

Twohandfuls  of  white  dust,  shut  in  an  urn  of  brass.** 

—Tennyson. 

It  was  by  main  force  that  Ulysses  dragged  these  men  away, 

and  he  was  even  obliged  to  tie  them  under  the  benches  of  his 

ship. 

**  Whoever  tasted  once  of  that  sweet  food 
Wished  not  to  see  his  native  country  more. 
Nor  give  his  friends  the  knowledge  of  his  fate. 
And  then  my  messengers  desired  to  dwell 
Among  the  Lotus-eaters,  and  to  feed 
Upon  the  lotus,  never  to  return." — HoMER  (Bryant's  tr.). 

They  next  arrived  at  the  country  of  the  Cy-clo'pes.  The 
Cyclopes  were  giants,  who  inhabited  an  island  of  which  they 
were  the  only  possessors.  The  name  means  *' round  eye,'*  and 
these  giants  were  so  called  because  they  had  but  one  eye,  and 
that  placed  in  the  middle  of  the  forehead.  They  dwelt  in  caves 
and  fed  on  the  wild  productions  of  the  island  and  on  what  their 
flocks  yielded,  for  they  were  shepherds. 

**  A  single  ball  of  sight  was  fix'd 
In  their  mid-forehead  : — hence  the  Cyclopes'  name  t 
For  that  one  circular  eye  was  broad  infix' d 
In  the  mid-forehead  : — strength  was  theirs,  and  force, 
And  craft  of  curious  toil." — Hesiod  (Elton's  tr.). 

Ulyss  ^  left  the  main  body  of  his  ships  at  anchor,  and  with

one  vessel  went  to  the  Cyclopes'  island  to  explore  for  supplies 
He  landed  with  his  companions,  carrying  with  them  a  jar  of 
wine  for  a  present,  and  coming  to  a  large  cave  they  entered  it, 
and  finding  no  one  within,  examined  its  contents.  They  found  it 
stored  with  the  riches  of  the  flock,  quantities  of  cheese,  pails  and 
bowls  of  milk,  lambs  and  kids  in  their  pens,  all  in  nice  order. 
Presently  arrived  the  master  of  the  cave,  Polyphemus,  bearing 
m  immense  bundle  of  firewood,  which  he  threw  down  before 
the  cavern's  mouth. 

**  Near  half  a  forest  on  his  back  he  bore.*' 

He  then  drove  into  the  cave  the  sheep  and  goats  to  be  milked, 
and,  entering,  rolled  to  the  cave's  mouth  an  enormous  rock,  that 
twenty  oxen  could  not  draw.  Next  he  sat  down  and  milked  his 
«wes,  preparing  a  part  for  cheese,  and  setting  the  rest  aside  for 
his  customary  drinko  Then  turning  round  his  great  eye  he  dis- 
cerned the  strangers,  and  growled  out  to  them,  demanding  who 
they  were,  and  where  from.  Ulysses  replied  most  humbly,  stat- 
ing that  they  were  Greeks,  from  the  great  expedition  that  had 
lately  won  so  much  glory  in  the  conquest  of  Troy ;  that  they 
were  now  on  their  way  home,  and  finished  by  imploring  his  hos- 
pitality in  the  name  of  the  gods.  Polyphemus  deigned  no  an- 
swer, but  reaching  out  his  hand  seized  two  of  the  Greeks,  whom 
he  hurled  against  the  side  of  the  cave,  and  dashed  out  their 
brains.  He  proceeded  to  devour  them  with  great  relish,  and 
having  made  a  hearty  meal,  stretched  himself  out  on  the  floor  to 
sleep.  Ulysses  was  tempted  to  seize  the  opportunity  and  plunge 
his  sword  into  him  as  he  slept,  but  recollected  that  it  would  only 
expose  them  all  to  certain  destruction,  as  the  rock  with  which 
the  giant  had  closed  up  the  door  was  far  beyond  their  power  to 
remove,  and  they  would  therefore  be  in  hopeless  imprisonment. 
Next  morning  the  giant  seized  two  more  of  the  Greeks,  and  de- 
spatched them  in  the  same  manner  as  their  companions,  feasting 
on  their  flesh  till  no  fragment  was  left.  He  then  moved  away 
the  rock  from  the  door,  drove  out  his  flocks^  and  went  out,  care- 
fully replacing  the  barrier  after  him- 

»♦  Then  pleased  and  whistHnp  drives  the  flocks  before. 
Removes  the  rocky  mountain  from  the  door. 
And  shuts  again." — HoMER  (Pope). 


RETURN  OF  ULYSSES,  297 

When  he  was  gone,  Ulysses  planned  how  he  might  take  ven- 
geance for  his  murdered  friends  and  effect  his  escape,  with  his 
surviving  companions.  He  made  his  men  prepare  a  massive  bar 
of  wood,  cut  by  the  Cyclops  for  a  staff,  which  they  found  in  the 
cave.  They  sharpened  the  end  of  it  and  seasoned  it  in  the  fire, 
and  hid  it  under  the  straw  on  the  cavern  floor.  Then  four  of 
the  boldest  were  selected,  with  whom  Ulysses  joined  himself  as 
a  fifth.  The  Cyclops  came  home  at  evening,  rolled  away  the 
stone  and  drove  in  his  flock  as  usual.  After  milking  them  and 
making  his  arrangements  as  before,  he  seized  two  more  of  Ulysses' 
companions  and  dashed  their  brains  out,  and  made  his  evening 
meal  upon  them  as  he  had  on  the  others.  After  he  had  supped, 
Ulysses,  approaching  him,  handed  him  a  bowl  of  wine,  saying, 
**  Cyclops,  this  is  wine  ;  taste  and  drink  after  thy  meal  of  man's 
flesh.'*  He  took  and  drank  it,  and  was  hugely  delighted  with 
it,  and  called  for  more.  Ulysses  supplied  him  once  and  again, 
which  pleased  the  giant  so  much  that  he  promised  him  as  a  favor 
that  he  should  be  the  last  of  the  party  devoured.  He  asked  his 
name,  to  which  Ulysses  replied,  **  My  name  is  Noman." 

After  his  supper  the  giant  lay  down  to  repose,  and  was  soon 
sound  asleep.  Then  Ulysses  with  his  four  select  friends  thrust 
the  end  of  the  stake  into  the  fire  till  it  was  all  one  burning  coal ; 
then  poising  it  exactly  above  the  giant's  only  eye,  they  buried  it 
deeply  into  the  socket,  twirling  it  round  as  a  carpenter  does  his 
auger.  The  howling  monster  with  his  outcry  filled  the  cavern, 
and  Ulysses  with  his  aids  nimbly  got  out  of  his  way  and  concealed 
themselves  in  the  cave.  He,  bellowing,  called  aloud  on  all  the 
Cyclopes  dwelling  in  the  caves  around  him,  far  and  near.  They 
on  his  cry  flocked  round  the  den,  and  inquired  what  grievous 
hurt  had  caused  him  to  sound  such  an  alarm  and  break  their 
slumbers.  He  replied,  **0  friends,  I  die,  and  Noman  gives  the 
blow."  They  answered,  **  If  no  man  hurts  thee  it  is  the  stroke 
of  Jove,  and  thou  must  bear  it."  So  saying,  they  left  him 
groaning. 

•*  If  no  man  hurts  thee,  but  the  hand  divine 
Inflicts  disease,  it  fits  thee  to  resign." — Homer  (Pope). 

Next  morning  the  Cyclops  rolled  away  the  stone  to  let  his  ^ocV 
out  to  pasture,  but  planted  himself  in  the  door  of  the  cave  to  fed

of  all  as  they  went  out,  that  Ulysses  and  his  men  should  not  es 
tape  with  them.  But  Ulysses  had  made  his  men  harness  the 
rams  of  the  flock  three  abreast,  with  osiers  which  they  found  on 
the  floor  of  the  cave.  To  the  middle  ram  of  the  three  one  of  the 
Greeks  suspended  himself,  so  protected  by  the  exterior  rams  on 
either  side.  As  they  passed,  the  giant  felt  of  the  animals*  backs 
and  sides,  but  never  thought  of  their  bellies ;  so  the  men  all 
passed  safe,  Ulysses  himself  being  on  the  last  one  that  passed. 

**  The  master  ram  at  last  approached  the  gate 
Charged  with  his  wool  and  with  Ulysses*  fate ; 
The  giant  spoke,  and  through  the  hollow  rock 
Dismissed  the  ram,  the  father  of  the  flock." 

— Homer  (Pope). 

When  they  had  got  a  few  paces  from  the  cavern,  Ulysses  and 
his  friends  released  themselves  from  their  rams,  and  drove  a  good 
part  of  the  flock  down  to  the  shore  to  their  boat.  They  put 
them  aboard  with  all  haste,  then  pushed  off  from  the  shore,  and 
when  Sit  a  safe  distance  Ulysses  shouted  out : 

**  Cyclops,  if  any  man  of  mortal  birth 
Note  thine  unseemly  blindness,  and  inquire 
The  occasion,  tell  hira  that  Laertes'  son, 
Ulysses,  the  destroyer  of  walled  towns, 
Whose  home  is  Ithaca,  put  out  thine  eye.'* 

— Homer  (Bryant's  tr.). 

The  Cyclops,  hearing  this,  seized  a  rock  that  projected  from  the 
side  of  the  mountain,  and  rending  it  from  its  bed  he  lifted  it 
high  in  the  air,  then  exerting  all  his  force,  hurled  it  in  the  direc- 
tion of  the  voice.  Down  came  the  mass,  just  clearing  the  ves- 
sel's stern.  The  ocean,  at  the  plunge  of  the  huge  rock,  heaved 
the  ship  towards  the  land,  so  that  it  barely  escaped  bein^ 
swamped  by  the  waves. 

*•  Old  ocean  shook,  and  back  his  surges  flew,*' 

When  they  had  with  the  utmost  difficulty  pulled  off  shore, 
Ulysses  was  about  to  hail  the  giant  again,  but  his  friends  be- 
sought him  not  to  do  so.  He  could  not  forbear,  however,  let- 
ling  the  giant  know  that  they  had  escaped  his  missile,  but  waited

till  they  had  reached  a  safer  distance  than  before.  The  giant 
answered  them  with  curses,  but  Ulysses  and  his  friends  plied 
their  oars  vigorously,  and  soon  regained  their  companions. 

Ulysses  next  arrived  at  the  island  of  ^olus.  To  this  mon- 
arch Jupiter  had  intrusted  the  government  of  the  winds,  to  send 
them  forth  or  retain  them  at  his  will.  He  treated  Ulysses  hos- 
pitably, and  at  his  departure  gave  him,  tied  up  in  a  leather  bag 
with  a  silver  string,  such  winds  as  might  be  hurtful  and  danger, 
ous,  commanding  fair  winds  to  blow  the  barks  towards  their 
country.  Nine  days  they  sped  before  the  wind,  and  all  that 
time  Ulysses  had  stood  at  the  helm,  without  sleep.  At  last, 
quite  exhausted,  he  lay  down  to  sleep.  While  he  slept,  the 
crew  conferred  together  about  the  mysterious  bag,  and  concluded 
it  must  contain  treasures  given  by  the  hospitable  King  ^olus 
to  their  commander.  Tempted  to  secure  some  portion  for  them- 
selves they  loosed  the  string,  when  immediately  the  winds  rushed 
forth. 

**  The  thongs  unbound, 
The  gushing  tempest  sweeps  the  ocean  round. 
Snatched  in  the  whirl." — Homer  (Pope). 

The  ships  were  driven  far  from  their  course,  and  back  again 
to  the  island  they  had  just  left,  ^olus  was  so  indignant  at 
their  folly  that  he  refused  to  assist  them  further,  and  they  were 
obliged  to  labor  over  their  course  once  more  by  means  of  their 
oars. 

The  Lses-try-go'ni-ans. 

Their  next  adventure  was  with  the  barbarous  tribe  of  Lses-try- 
go^ni-ans.  The  vessels  all  pushed  into  the  harbor,  tempted  by 
the  secure  appearance  of  the  cove,  completely  land-locked  ;  only 
Ulysses  moored  his  vessel  without.  As  soon  as  the  Laestrygo- 
lians  found  the  ships  completely  in  their  power  they  attacked 
them,  heaving  huge  stones  which  broke  and  overturned  them, 
and  with  their  spears  despatched  the  seamen  as  they  struggled  in 
the  water.  All  the  vessels  with  their  crews  were  destroyed,  ex- 
cept Ulysses'  own  ship,  which  had  remained  outside,  and  finding 
no  safety  but  in  flight,  he  exhorted  his  men  to  ply  their  oars 
vigorously,  and  they  escaped. 

With  grief  for  their  slain  companions  mixed  with  joy  at  theil

own  escape,  they  pursued  their  way  till  they  arrived  at  the 
/Eaean  isle,  where  Circe  dwelt,  the  daughter  of  the  sun.  Land- 
ing here,  Ulysses  climbed  a  hill,  and  gazing  round,  saw  no  signs 
of  habitation  except  in  one  spot  at  the  centre  of  the  island,  where 
he  perceived  a  palace  embowered  with  trees.  He  sent  forward 
one-half  of  his  crew,  under  the  command  of  Eurylochus,  to  see 
what  prospect  of  hospitality  they  might  find.  As  they  approached 
the  palace,  they  found  themselves  surrounded  by  lions,  tigers  and 
wolves,  not  fierce,  but  tamed  by  Circe's  art,  for  she  was  a  power- 
ful magician.  All  these  animals  had  once  been  men,  but  had 
been  changed  by  Circe's  enchantments  into  the  forms  of  beasts.

The  sounds  of  soft  music  were  heard  from  within,  and  a  sweet 
female  voice  singing.  Eurylochus  called  aloud,  and  the  goddess 
came  forth  and  invited  them  in  ;  they  all  gladly  entered  except 
Eurylochus,  who  suspected  danger.  The  goddess  conducted  hei 
guests  to  a  seat,  and  had  them  served  with  wine  and  other  deli- 
cacies. When  they  had  feasted  heartily,  she  touched  them  one 
by  one  with  her  wand,  and  they  became  immediately  changed 
into  swine,  in  *'head,  body,  voice  and  bristles^"  yet  with  their

Eurylochus  hurried  back  to  the  ship  and  told  the  tale.  Ulysses 
thereupon  determined  to  go  himself,  and  try  if  by  any  means  he 
n:ight  deliver  his  companions.  As  he  strode  onward  alone,  he

cury,  and  informed  Ulysses  of  the  arts  of  Circe,  and  of  the  dan- 
ger of  approaching  her.  As  Ulysses  was  not  to  be  dissuaded 
from  his  attempt,  Mercury  provided  him  with  a  sprig  of  the 
plant  Moly,  of  wonderful  power  to  resist  sorceries,  and  instructed 
him  how  to  act.  Ulysses  proceeded,  and  reaching  the  palace 
was  courteously  received  by  Circe,  who  entertained  him  as  she 
had  done  his  companions,  and  after  he  had  eaten  and  drank, 
touched  him  with  her  wand,  saying,  **  Hence,  seek  the  sty  and 
wallow  with  thy  friends."  But  he,  instead  of  obeying,  drew  his 
sword  and  rushed  upon  her  with  fury  in  his  countenance.  She 
fell  on  her  knees  and  begged  for  mercy.  He  dictated  a  solemn 
oath  that  she  would  release  his  companions  and  practice  no  lur-

tertaining  them.  She  was  as  good  as  her  word.  The  men  were 
restored  to  their  shapes,  the  rest  of  the  crew  summoned  from  the 
shore,  and  the  whole  magnificently  entertained  day  after  day,  till 
Ulysses  seemed  to  have  forgotten  his  native  land,  and  to  have 
reconciled  himself  to  an  inglorious  life  of  ease  and  pleasure.

departure,  and  instructed  them  how  to  pass  safely  by  the  coast 
of  the  Sirens.  The  Sirens  were  sea-nymphs  who  had  the  power 
of  charming  by  their  song  all  who  heard  them,  so  that  the  un- 
happy mariners  were  irresistibly  impelled  to  cast  themselves  into 
the  sea  to  their  destruction.  Circe  directed  Ulysses  to  fill  the 
ears  of  his  seamen  with  wax,  so  that  they  should  not  hear  the 
strain ;  and  to  cause  himself  to  be  bound  to  the  mast,  and  his 
people  to  be  strictly  enjoined,  whatever  he  might  say  or  do,  by 
no  means  to  release  him  till  they  should  have  passed  the  Sirens' 
island.  Ulysses  obeyed  these  directions.  He  filled  the  ears  of 
his  people  with  wax,  and  suffered  them  to  bind  him  with  cords 
firmly  to  the  mast.  As  they  approached  the  Sirens*  island  the 
sea  was  calm,  and  over  the  waters  came  the  notes  of  music  so 
ravishing  and  attractive  that  Ulysses  struggled  to  get  loose,  and 
by  cries  and  signs  to  his  people  begged  to  be  released  ;  but.  they^

And  bound  me  limb  by  limb  with  fold  on  fold." 

— Homer  ^Pope). 

They  held  on  their  course,  and  the  music  grew  fainter  till  it 
ceased  to  be  heard,  when  with  joy  Ulysses  gave  his  companions 
the  signal  to  unseal  their  ears,  and  they  relieved  him  from  his 
bonds. 

Scyl'la   and  Cha-ryb'dis. 

Ulysses  had  been  warned  by  Circe  of  the  two  monsters  ScyVla 
and  Cha-ryb'dis.  We  have  already  met  with  Scylla  in  the 
story  of  Glaucus,  and  remember  that  she  was  once  a  beautiful 
maiden,  and  was  changed  into  a  snaky  monster  by  Circe.  She 
dwelt  in  a  cave  high  up  on  the  cliff,  from  whence  she  was  accus- 
tomed to  thrust  forth  her  long  necks  (for  she  had  six  heads),  and 
in  each  of  her  mouths  to  seize  one  of  the  crew  of  every  vessel 
passing  within  reach. 

**  No  mariner  can  boast 
That  he  has  passed  by  Scylla  with  a  crew 
Unharmed  ;  she  snatches  from  the  deck  and  bears 
Away  in  each  grim  mouth  a  living  man." 

— Homer  (Bryant's  tr.). 

The  other  terror,  Charybdis,  was  a  gulf,  nearly  on  a  level  with 
the  water.  Thrice  each  day  the  water  rushed  into  a  frightful 
chasm,  and  thrice  was  disgorged. 


*<  And  dire  Charybdis  rolls  her  thundering  wave." 

Any  vessel  coming  near  the  whirlpool  when  the  tide  was  rush- 
ing in  must  inevitably  be  ingulfed ;  not  Neptune  himself  could 
save  it.* 

On  approaching  the  haunt  of  the  dread  monsters,  Ulysses  kept 
strict  watch  to  discover  them.  The  roar  of  the  waters  as  Cha- 
rybdis ingulfed   them    gave  warning  at  a  distance,  but  Scylla

could  nowhere  be  discerned.  While  Ulysses  and  his  men  watched 
with  anxious  eyes  the  dreadful  whirlpool,  they  were  not  equally 
on  their  guard  from  the  attack  of  Scylla,  and  the  monster,  dart- 
ing forth  her  snaky  heads,  caught  six  of  his  men,  and  bore  them 
away,  ehrieking,  to  her  den.  It  was  the  saddest  sight  Ulysses  had 
yet  seen ;  to  behold  his  friends  thus  sacrificed  and  hear  their 
cries,  unable  to  afford  them  any  assistance. 

Circe  had  warned  him  of  another  danger.  After  passing  Scylla 
and  Charybdis,  the  next  land  he  would  make  was  Thrinakia,  an 
island  whereon  were  pastured  the  cattle  of  Hyperion,  the  Sun, 
tended  by  his  daughters,  Lampetia  and  Phaethusa.  These  flocks 
must  not  be  violated,  whatever  the  wants  of  the  voyagers  might 
be.  If  this  injunction  were  transgressed,  destruction  was  sure  to 
fall  on  the  offenders. 

Ulysses  would  willingly  have  passed  the  island  of  the  Sun 
without  stopping,  but  his  companions  so  urgently  pleaded  for 
the  rest  and  refreshment  that  would  be  derived  from  anchoring 
?nd  passing  the  night  on  shore,  that  Ulysses  yielded.  He  bound 
tliem,  however,  with  an  oath  that  they  would  not  touch  one  of 
tl\e  animals  of  the  sacred  flocks  and  herds,  but  content  them- 
selves with  what  provision  they  yet  had  left  of  the  supply  which 
Circe  had  put  on  board.  So  long  as  this  supply  lasted  the  people 
kept  their  oath,  but  contrary  winds  detained  them  at  the  island 
for  a  month,  and  after  consuming  all  their  stock  of  provisions, 
they  were  forced  to  rely  upon  the  birds  and  fishes  they  could 
catch.  Famine  pressed  them,  and  at  length  one  day,  in  the  ab- 
sence of  Ulysses,  they  slew  some  of  the  cattle,  vainly  attempting 
to  make  amends  for  the  deed  by  offering  from  them  a  portion  to 
the  offended  powers.  Ulysses,  on  his  return  to  the  shore,  was 
horror-struck  at  perceiving  what  they  had  done,  and  the  more 
>o  on  account  of  the  portentous  signs  which  followed.  The  skins 
crept  on  the  ground,  and  the  joints  of  meat  lowed  on  the  spits 
while  roasting. 

**  The  sacred  oxen  of  the  Sun,  whose  flesh 
Destined  to  utter  a  tremendous  voice,

The  wind  becoming  fair,  they  sailed  from  the  island.  They 
had  not  gone  far  when  the  weather  changed,  and  a  storm  of

their  mast,  which  in  its  fall  killed  the  pilot.  At  last  the  vessel 
itself  went  to  pieces.     The  keel  and  mast  floating  side  by  side.

Ulysses  formed  of  them  a  raft,  to  which  he  clung,  and,  the  wind 
changing,  the  waves  bore  him  to  Calypso's  island.  All  the  rest 
of  the  crew  perished.

entertained  him  magnificently,  became  enamoured  of  him,  and 
wished  to  retain  him  forever,  conferring  on  him  immortality. 
But  he  persisted  in  his  resolution  to  return  to  his  country  and 
his  wife  and  son.  Calypso  at  last  received  the  command  of  Jove 
to  dismiss  him.  Mercury  brought  the  message  to  her,  and  found 
her  in  her  grotto,  which  is  thus  described  by  Homer  ;^— 

**  A  garden  vine,  luxuriant  on  all  sides, 
Mantled  the  spacious  cavern,  cluster-hung 
Profuse  ;  four  fountains  of  serenest  lymph, 
Their  sinuous  course  pursuing  side  by  side, 
Strayed  all  around,  and  everywhere  appeared 
Meadows  of  softest  verdure,  purpled  o'er 
With  violets  ;  it  was  a  scene  to  fill  ,  - 

A  god  from  heaven  with  wonder  and  delight;" 

Calypso  with  much  reluctance  proceeded  to  obey  the  com- 
mands of  Jupiter.  She  supplied  Ulysses  with  the  means  of  con- 
structing a  raft,  provisioned  it  well  for  him,  and  gave  him  a 
favoring  gale.  He  sped  on  his  course  prosperously  for  many 
days,  till  at  length,  when  in  sight  of  land,  a  storm  arose  that 
broke  his  mast  and  threatened  to  rend  the  raft  asunder.  In  this 
crisis  he  was  seen  by  a  compassionate  sea-nymph,  who  in  the 
form  of  a  cormorant  alighted  on  the  raft  and  presented  him  a 
girdle,  directing  him  to  bind  it  beneath  his  breast,  and  if  he 
should  be  compelled  to  trust  himself  to  the  waves  it  would  buoy 
him  up,  and  enable  him  by  swimming  to  reach  the  land, 

Te-lem'a-chus. 

Fenelon,  in  his  romance  of  Te-lem'a-chus,  has  given  us  the 
adventures  of  the  son  of  Ulysses  in  search  of  his  father.  Among 
other  places  at  which  he  arrived,  following  on  his  father's  foot- 
steps, was  Calypso's  isle,  and,  as  in  the  former  case,  the  goddess 
tried  every  art  to  keep  him  with  her,  and  offered  to  share  her 
immortality  with  him.  But  Minerva,  who  in  the  .shape  of 
Mentor  accompanied  him  and  governed  all  his  movements,  made 
him  repel  her  allurements,  and  when  no  other  means  of  escape 
could  be  found,  the  two  friends  leaped  from  a  cliff  into  the  sea 
and  swam  to  a  vessel  which  lay  becalmed  off  shore.     Byron 


TELEMACHUS,  307 

alludes  to  this  leap  of  Telemachus  and  Mentor  in  the  following 
stanza : — 

"  But  not  in  silence  pass  Calypso's  isles, 
The  sister  tenants  of  the  middle  deep  ; 
There  for  the  weary  slill  a  haven  smiles, 
Though  the  fair  goddess  long  has  ceased  to  weep, 
And  o'er  her  cliffs  a  fruitless  watch  to  keep 
For  him  who  dared  prefer  a  mortal  bride. 
Here  too  his  boy  essayed  the  dreadful  leap, 
Stern  Mentor  urged  from  high  to  yonder  tide  ; 
"While  thus  of  both  bereft  the  nymph- queen  doubly  sighed."

CHAPTER  XXX. 
The  Phse-a'ci-ans — Fate  of  the  Suitorc 

The  Phae-a'ci-ans. 

Ulysses  clung  to  the  raft  while  any  of  its  timbers  kept  lu* 
gether,  and  when  it  no  longer  yielded  him  support,  binding  the 
girdle  around  him,  he  swam.  Minerva  smoothed  the  billowa 
before  him,  and  sent  him  a  wind  that  rolled  the  waves  towards 
the  shore.  The  surf  beat  high  on  the  rocks  and  seemed  to  for- 
bid approach ;  but  at  length,  finding  calm  water  at  the  mouth 
of  a  gentle  stream,  he  landed,  spent  with  toil,  breathless  and 
speechless,  and  almost  dead.  After  some  time,  reviving,  he  kissed 
the  soil,  rejoicing,  yet  at  a  loss  what  course  to  take.  At  a  short 
distance  he  perceived  a  wood,  to  which  he  turned  his  steps. 
There,  finding  a  covert  sheltered  by  intermingling  branches 
alike  from  the  sun  and  the  rain,  he  collected  a  pile  of  leaves  and 
formed  a  bed,  on  which  he  stretched  himself,  and  heaping  the 
leaves  over  him,  fell  asleep. 

The  land  where  he  was  thrown  was  Scheria,  the  country  of 
the  Phae-a'ci-ans.  These  people  dwelt  originally  near  the 
Cyclopes ;  but  being  oppressed  by  that  savage  race,  they  migra- 
ted to  the  isle  of  Scheria,  under  the  conduct  of  Nausithoiis, 
their  king.  They  were,  the  poet  tells  us,  a  people  akin  to  the 
gods,  who  appeared  manifestly  and  feasted  among  them  when 
they  offered  sacrifices,  and  did  not  conceal  themselves  from  soli» 
tary  wayfarers  when  they  met  them.

from  gain-seeking  man,  no  enemy  ever  approached  their  shores, 
and  they  did  not  even  require  to  make  use  of  bows  and  quivers. 
Their  chief  employment  was  navigation.  Their  ships,  which 
went  with  the  velocity  of  birds,  were  endued  with  intelligence; 
they  knew  every  port  and  needed  no  pilot.

Alcinoiis,  the  son  of  Nausithoiis,  was  now  their  king,  a  wise 
and  just  sovereign,  beloved  by  his  people. 

Now  it  happened  that  the  very  night  on  which  Ulysses  was 
cast  ashore  on  the  Phaeacian  island,  and  while  he  lay  sleeping  on 
his  bed  of  leaves,  Nausicaa,  the  daughter  of  the  king,  had  a 
dream,  sent  by  Minerva,  reminding  her  that  her  wedding-day 
was  not  far  distant,  and  that  it  would  be  but  a  prudent  prepara- 
tion for  that  event  to  have  a  general  washing  of  the  clothes  of 
the  family.  This  was  no  slight  affair,  for  the  fountains  were  at 
some  distance  and  the  garments  must  be  carried  thither.  On 
awaking,  the  princess  hastened  to  her  parents  to  tell  them  what 
was  on  her  mind — not  alluding  to  her  wedding-day,  but  finding 
other  reasons  equally  good.  Her  father  readily  assented,  and 
ordered  the  grooms  to  furnish  forth  a  wagon  for  the  purpose. 
The  clothes  were  put  therein,  and  the  queen -mother  placed  in 
the  wagon  likewise  an  abundant  supply  of  food  and  wine.  The 
princess  took  her  seat  and  plied  the  lash,  her  attendant  virgins 
following  her  on  foot.  Arrived  at  the  river-side,  they  turned 
out  the  mules  to  graze,  and  unlading  the  carriage,  bore  the  gar- 
ments down  to  the  water,  and  working  with  cheerfulness  and 
alacrity,  soon  despatched  their  labor.  Then,  having  spread  the 
garments  on  the  shore  to  dry,  and  having  themselves  bathed, 
they  sat  down  to  enjoy  their  meal ;  after  which  they  rose  and 
amused  themselves  with  a  game  of  ball,  the  princess  singing  to 
them  while  they  played.  But  when  they  had  refolded  the  ap« 
pare!  and  were  about  to  resume  their  way  to  the  town,  Minerva 
caused  the  ball  thrown  by  the  princess  to  fall  into  the  w^ater* 
•vhereat  they  all  screamed,  and  Ulysses  awaked  at  the  sound. 


3IO  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES. 

Now  we  must  picture  to  ourselves  Ulysses,  a  shipwrecked 
mariner,  but  a  few  hours  escaped  from  the  waves,  and  utterly 
destitute  of  clothing,  awaking  and  discovering  that  only  a  few 
bushes  were  interposed  between  him  and  a  group  of  young 
maidens,  whom  by  their  deportment  and  attire  he  discovered  to 
be  not  mere  peasant  girls,  but  of  a  higher  class.  Sadly  needing 
help,  how  could  hh  yet  venture,  naked  as  he  was,  to  aiscover 
himself  and  make  his  wants  known?  It  certainly  was  a  case 
worthy  of  the  interposition  of  his  patron  goddess  Minerva,  who 
never  failed  him  at  a  crisis.  Breaking  off  a  leafy  branch  from  a 
tree,  he  held  it  before  him  and  stepped  out  from  the  thicket. 
The  virgins  at  sight  of  him  fled  in  all  directions,  Nausicaa  alone 
excepted,  for  Minerva  aided  and  endowed  her  with  courage  and 
discernment.  Ulysses,  standing  respectfully  aloof,  told  his  sad 
case  and  besought  the  fair  object  (whether  queen  or  goddess  he 
professed  he  knew  not)  for  food  and  clothing.  The  princess  re- 
plied courteously,  promising  present  relief  and  her  father's  hos- 
pitality when  he  should  become  acquainted  with  the  facts.  She 
called  back  her  scattered  maidens,  chiding  their  alarm,  and  re- 
minding them  that  the  Phaeacians  had  no  enemies  to  fear.  This 
man,  she  told  them,  was  an  unhappy  wanderer,  whom  it  was  a 
duty  to  cherish,  for  the  poor  and  stranger  are  from  Jove. 

«*  'Tis  ours  this  son  of  sorrow  to  relieve, 
Cheer  the  sad  heart,  nor  let  affliction  grieve  ; 
By  Jove  the  stranger  and  the  poor  are  sent. 
And  what  to  those  we  give  to  Jove  is  lent.'* 

— Homer  (Pope). 

She  bade  them  bring  food  and  clothing,  for  some  of  her 
brothers'  garments  were  among  the  contents  of  the  wagon. 
When  this  was  done,  and  Ulysses,  retiring  to  a  sheltered  place, 
had  washed  his  body  free  from  the  sea-foam,  clothed  and  re- 
freshed himself  with  food,  Pallas  dilated  his  form  and  diffused 
grace  over  his  ample  chest  and  manly  brows. 

The  princess,  seeing  him,  was  filled  with  admiration,  and  scru- 
pled not  to  say  to  her  damsels  that  she  wished  the  gods  would 
send  her  such  a  husband.  To  Ulysses  she  recommended  that 
he  should  repair  to  the  city,  following  herself  and  train  so  far  as 
the  way  lay  through  the  fields ;  but  when  they  should  approach 


TBE  PH^A CIANS.  3 1 1 

the  city  she  desired  that  he  would  no  longer  be  seen  in  her  com« 
pany,  for  she  feared  the  remarks  which  rude  and  vulgar  people 
might  make  on  seeing  her  return  accompanied  by  such  a  gallant 
stranger — to  avoid  which  she  directed  him  to  stop  at  a  grove 
adjoining  the  city,  in  which  were  a  farm  and  garden  belonging 
to  the  king.  After  allowing  time  for  the  princess  and  her  com- 
panions to  reach  the  city,  he  was  then  to  pursue  his  way  thither, 
and  would  be  easily  guided,  by  anyone  whom  he  might  meet,  to 
the  royal  abode. 

Ulysses  obeyed  the  directions,  and  in  due  time  proceeded  to 
the  city,  on  approaching  which  he  met  a  young  woman  bearing 
a  pitcher  forth  for  water.  It  was  Minerva,  who  had  assumed  that 
form.  Ulysses  accosted  her,  and  desired  to  be  directed  to  the 
palace  of  Alcinous  the  king.  The  maiden  replied  respectfully, 
offering  to  be  his  guide  ;  for  the  palace,  she  informed  him,  stood 
near  her  father's  dwelling.  Under  the  guidance  of  the  goddess, 
and  by  her  power  enveloped  in  a  cloud  which  shielded  him  from 
observation,  Ulysses  passed  among  the  busy  crowd,  and  with 
wonder  observed  their  harbor,  their  shi')s,  their  forum  (the  re- 
sort of  heroes),  and  their  battlements,  till  they  came  to  the  palace, 
where  the  goddess,  having  first  given  him  some  information  of 
the  country,  king  and  people  he  was  about  to  meet,  left  him. 
Ulysses,  before  entering  the  court-yard  of  the  palace,  stood  and 
surveyed  the  scene.  Its  splendor  astonished  him.  Brazen  walls 
stretched  from  the  entrance  to  the  interior  house,  of  which  the 
doors  were  gold,  the  door-posts  silver,  the  lintels  silver  orna- 
mented with  gold.  On  either  side  were  figures  of  mastiffs 
wrought  in  gold  and  silver,  standing  in  rows,  as  if  to  guard  the 
approach.  Along  the  walls  were  seats  spread  through  all  their 
length,  with  mantles  of  finest  texture,  the  work  of  Phaeacian 
maidens.  On  these  seats  the  princes  sat  and  feasted,  while 
golden  statues  of  graceful  youths  held  in  their  hands  lighted 
torches,  which  shed  radiance  over  the  scene.  Full  fifty  female 
menials  served  in  household  offices,  some  employed  to  grind  the 
corn,  others  to  wind  off  the  purple  wool  or  ply  the  loom ;  for 
\he  Phaeacian  women  as  far  exceeded  all  other  women  in  house- 
hold  arts  as  the  mariners  of  that  country  did  the  rest  of  mankind 
in  the  management  of  ship*".  Without  the  court  a  spacious  garden

granate,  pear,  apple,  fig,  and  olive.  Neither  winter's  cold  noi 
summer's  drought  arrested  their  growth,  but  they  flourished  in 
constant  succession,  some  budding  while  others  were  maturing. 
The  vineyard  was  equally  prolific.  In  one  quarter  you  might 
see  the  vines,  some  in  blossom,  some  loaded  with  ripe  grapes, 
and  in  another  observe  the  vintagers  treading  the  wine-press. 

**  To  Pallas*  sacred  shades,  the  holy  ground. 
We  bend  our  way." — Homer. 

On  the  garden's  borders  flowers  of  all  hues  bloomed  all  the 
year  round,  arranged  with  neatest  art.  In  the  midst  two  foun- 
tains poured  forth  their  waters,  one  flowing  by  artificial  channels 
over  all  the  garden,  the  other  conducted  through  the  court-yard 
of  the  palace,  whence  every  citizen  might  draw  his  supplies. 

Ulysses  stood  gazing  in  admiration,  unobserved  himself,  for 
the  cloud  which  Minerva  spread  around  him  still  shielded  him. 
At  length,  having  sufficiently  observed  the  scene,  he  advanced 
with  rapid  step  into  the  hall  where  the  chiefs  and  senators  were 
assembled,  pouring  libation  to  Mercury,  whose  worship  followed 
the  evening  meal.  Just  then  Minerva  dissolved  the  cloud  and 
disclosed  him  to  the  assembled  chiefs.  Advancing  to  the  place 
where  the  queen  sat,  he  knelt  at  her  feet  and  implored  her  favor 
and  assistance  to  enable  him  to  return  to  his  native  country. 
Then  withdrawing,  he  seated  himself  in  the  manner  of  suppli- 
ants, at  the  hearth-side. 

For  a  time  none  spoke.  At  last  an  aged  statesman,  addressing 
the  king,  said,  **  It  is  not  fit  that  a  stranger  who  asks  our  hospi- 
tality should  be  kept  waiting  in  suppliant  guise,  none  welcoming 
him.  Let  him  therefore  be  led  to  a  seat  among  us  and  supplied 
with  food  and  wine.'*  At  these  words  the  king,  rising,  gave  his 
"land  to  Ulysses  and  led  him  to  a  seat,  displacing  thence  his  own 
'»on  to  make  room  for  the  stranger. 

**  His  sage  advice  the  listening  king  obeys. 

He  stretched  his  hand  the  prudent  chief  to  raise. 

And  from  his  seat  his  son  removed." — Homer  (Pope). 

Food  and  wine  were  set  before  him,  and  he  ate  and  refreshed 
himself 

The  king  then  dismissed  his  guests,  notifying  them  that  the 


THE  PH.EA  CIANS.  3 1 3 

next  day  he  would  call  them  to  council  to  consider  what  had 
best  be  done  for  th"^  stranger. 

When  the  guests  had  departed  and  Ulysses  was  left  alone  with 
the  king  and  queen,  the  queen  asked  him  who  he  was  and  whence 
he  came,  and  (recognizing  the  clothes  which  he  wore  as  those 
which  her  maidens  and  herself  had  made)  from  whom  he  re- 
ceived  those  garments.  He  told  them  of  his  residence  in  Ca- 
lypso's isle  and  his  departure  thence  ;  of  the  wreck  of  his  raft, 
his  escape  by  swimming,  and  of  the  relief  afforded  by  the  princess. 
The  parents  heard  approvingly,  and  the  king  promised  to  furnish 
a  ship  in  which  his  guest  might  return  to  his  own  land. 

The  next  day  the  assembled  chiefs  confirmed  the  promise  of 
the  king.  A  bark  was  prepared  and  a  crew  of  stout  rowers  se- 
lected, and  all  betook  themselves  to  the  palace,  where  a  bounte- 
ous repast  was  provided.  After  the  feast  the  king  proposed  that 
the  young  men  should  show  their  guest  their  proficiency  in  manly 
sports,  and  all  went  forth  to  the  arena  for  games  of  running, 
wrestling,  and  other  exercises.  After  all  had  done  their  best, 
Ulysses,  being  challenged  to  show  what  he  could  do,  at  first  de- 
clined, but  being  taunted  by  one  of  the  youths,  seized  a  quoit  of 
weight  far  heavier  than  any  the  Phaeacians  had  thrown,  and  sent 
it  farther  than  the  utmost  throw  of  theirs. 

**No  more  I  waive 
To  prove  the  hero— slander  stings  the  brave." — Homer. 

All  were  astonished,  and  viewed  their  guest  with  greatly  in- 
creased respect. 

After  the  games  they  returned  to  the  hall,  and  the  herald  led 
in  Demodocus,  the  blind  bard, — 

**  Dear  to  the  Muse, 
Who  yet  appointed  him  both  good  and  ill, 
Took  from  him  sight,  but  gave  him  strains  divine." — Homer. 

He  took  for  his  theme  the  Wooden  Horse,  by  means  of  which 
the  Greeks  found  entrance  into  Troy.  Apollo  inspired  him,  and 
he  sang  so  feelingly  the  terrors  and  the  exploits  of  that  eventful 
time  that  all  were  delighted,  but  Ulysses  was  moved  to  tears. 

•'  And  as  he  sang  of  war  and  death 
The  Chieftain  wept." — Homer.

Observing  which,  Alcinous,  when  the  song  was  done,  demanded 
of  him  why,  at  the  mention  of  Troy,  his  sorrows  awaked.  Had 
he  lost  there  a  father  or  brother,  or  any  dear  friend  ?  Ulysses 
replied  by  announcing  himself  by  his  true  name,  and  at  their  re- 
quest recounted  the  adventures  which  had  befallen  him  since  his 
departure  from  Troy.  This  narrative  raised  the  sympathy  and 
admiration  of  the  Phaeacians  for  their  guest  to  the  highest  pitch. 
The  king  proposed  that  all  the  chiefs  should  present  him  with 
a  gift,  himself  setting  the  example.  They  obeyed,  and  vied 
with  one  another  in  loading  the  illustrious  stranger  with  costly 
gifts. 

The  next  day  Ulysses  set  sail  in  the  Phaeacian  vessel,  and  in  a 
short  time  arrived  safe  at  Ithaca,  his  own  island.  When  the  ves- 
sel touched  the  strand  he  was  asleep.  The  mariners,  without 
waking  him,  carried  him  on  shore,  and  landed  with  him  the 
chest  containing  his  presents,  and  then  sailed  away. 

Neptune  was  so  displeased  at  the  conduct  of  the  Phaeacians  in 
thus  rescuing  Ulysses  from  his  hands  that  on  the  return  of  the 
vessel  to  port  he  transformed  it  into  a  rock,  right  opposite  the 
mouth  of  the  harbor. 

**  He  drew  near 
And  smote  it  with  his  open  palm,  and  made 
The  ship  a  rock,  fast  rooted  in  the  bed 
Of  the  deep  sea,"  — Homer  (Bryant's  tr.). 

Lord  Carlisle  thus  speaks  of  Corfu,  which  he  considers  to  be 
the  ancient  Phaeacian  island  : 

**The  sites  explain  the  Odyssey.  The  temple  of  the  sea-god 
could  not  have  been  more  fitly  placed,  upon  a  grassy  platform 
of  the  most  elastic  turf,  on  the  brow  of  a  crag  commanding  har- 
bor, and  channel,  and  ocean.  Just  at  the  entrance  of  the  inner 
harbor  there  is  a  picturesque  rock  with  a  small  convent  perched 
upon  it,  which  by  one  legend  is  the  transformed  pinnace  of 
Ulysses. 

**  Almost  the  only  river  in  the  island  is  just  at  the  proper 
distance  from  the  probable  site  of  the  city  and  palace  of  the 
king  to  justify  the  princess  Nausicaa  having  had  resort  to  her 
chariot  and  to  luncheon  when  she  went  with  the  maidens  of  the 
court  to  wash  their  garments. '  *

"To  gain  his  home  all  oceans  he  explored, 

Here  Scylla  frowned  and  there  Charybdis  roared ; 

Horror  on  sea — and  horror  on  land  — 

In  hell's  dark  boat  he  sought  the  spectre  land, 

Till  borne — a  slumberer — to  his  native  spot, 

He  woke — and,  sorrowing,  knew  his  country  not." 

— Schiller  (Hempel). 

Fate  of  the  Suitors. 

Ulysses  had  now  been  away  from  Ithaca  for  twenty  years,  and 
when  he  awoke  he  did  not  recognize  his  native  land.  Minerva 
appeared  to  him  in  the  form  of  a  young  shepherd,  informed  him 
where  he  was,  and  told  him  the  state  of  things  at  his  palace. 
More  than  a  hundred  nobles  of  Ithaca  and  of  the  neighboring 
islands  had  been  for  years  suing  for  the  hand  of  Penelope,  his 
wife,  imagining  him  dead,  and  lording  it  over  his  palace  and 
people  as  if  they  were  owners  of  both.  That  he  might  be  able 
to  take  vengeance  upon  them,  it  was  important  that  he  should 
not  be  recognized.  Minerva  accordingly  metamorphosed  him 
into  an  unsightly  beggar. 


« 


Propped  on  a  staff,  a  beggar  old  and  bare.** 


As  such  he  was  kindly  received  by  Eumaeus,  the  swine-herd, 
a  faithful  servant  of  his  house. 

Telemachus,  his  son,  was  absent  in  quest  of  his  father.  He 
had  gone  to  the  courts  of  the  other  kings,  who  had  returned 
from  the  Trojan  expedition.  While  on  the  search,  he  received 
counsel  from  Minerva  to  return  home.  He  arrived,  and  sought 
Eumaeus  to  learn  something  of  the  state  of  affairs  at  the  palace 
before  presenting  himself  among  the  suitors.  Finding  a  stranger 
with  Eumaeus,  he  treated  him  courteously,  though  in' the  garb 
of  a  beggar,  and  promised  him  assistance.  Eumaeus  was  sent 
to  the  palace  to  inform  Penelope  privately  of  her  son's  arrival, 
for  caution  was  necessary  with  regard  to  the  suitors,  who,  as 
Telemachus  had  learned,  were  plotting  to  intercept  and  kill 
him.  When  Eumaeus  was  gone,  Minerva  presented  herself  to 
Ulysses,  and  directed  him  to  make  himself  known  to  his  son. 
At  the  same  time  she  touched  him,  removed  at  once  from  him 
the  appearance  of  age  and  penury,  and  gave  him  the  aspect  of 
vigorous  manhood  that  belonged  to  him.     Telemachus  viewed 


3l6  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES 

him  with  astonishment,  and  at  first  thought  he  must  be  more 

than  mortal.     But  Ulysses  announced  himself  as  his  father,  and 

accounted  for  the   change  of  appearance  by  explaining  that  it 

was  Minerva's  doing. 

**  Then  threw  Telemachus 
His  arms  around  his  father' s  neck  and  wept. 
Desire  intense  of  lamentation  seized 
On  both  ;  soft  murmurs  uttering,  each  indulged 
His  grief." — HoMER. 

The  father  and  son  took  counsel  together  how  they  should 
get  the  better  of  the  suitors  and  punish  them  for  their  outrages. 
It  was  arranged  that  Telemachus  should  proceed  to  the  palace 
and  mingle  with  the  suitors  as  formerly  ;  that  Ulysses  should  also 
go  as  a  beggar,  a  character  which  in  the  rude  old  times  had  dif- 
ferent privileges  from  what  we  concede  to  it  now.  As  traveller 
and  story-teller,  the  beggar  was  admitted  in  the  halls  of  chief- 
tains, and  often  treated  like  a  guest — though  sometimes,  also, 
no  doubt,  with  contumely.  Ulysses  charged  his  son  not  to  be- 
tray, by  any  display  of  unusual  interest  in  him,  that  he  knew 
him  to  be  other  than  he  seemed,  and  even  if  he  saw  him  insulted 
or  beaten,  not  to  interpose  otherwise  than  he  might  do  for  any 
stranger.  At  the  palace  they  found  the  usual  scene  of  feasting 
and  riot  going  on.  The  suitors  pretended  to  receive  Telemachus 
with  joy  at  his  return,  though  secretly  mortified  at  the  failure  of 
their  plots  to  take  his  life.  The  old  beggar  was  permitted  to 
enter,  and  provided  with  a  portion  from  the  table.  A  touching 
incident  occurred  as  Ulysses  entered  the  court-yard  of  the  palace. 
An  old  dog  lay  in  the  yard  almost  dead  with  age,  and  seeing  a 
stranger  enter,  raised  his  head,  with  ears  erect.  It  was  Argus, 
Ulysses'  own  dog,  that  he  had  in  other  days  often  led  to  the 
chase. 

**  Soon  as  he  perceived 
Long  lost  Ulysses  nigh,  down  fell  his  ears 
Clapped  close,  and  with  his  tail  glad  sign  he  gave 
Of  gratulation,  impotent  to  rise, 
And  to  approach  his  master  as  of  old. 
Ulysses,  noting  him,  wiped  off  a  tear 
Unmarked." — Homer. 

As  Ulysses  sat  eating  his  portion  in  the  hall,  the  suitors  soon 
began  to  exhibit  their  insolence  to  him.     When  he  mildly  re- 


FA  TE  OF  THE  SUITORS.  3 1 7 

monstrated,  one  of  them  raised  a  stool,  and  with  it  ^ave  him  a 
blow.  Telemachus  had  hard  work  to  restrain  his  indignation  at 
seeing  his  father  so  treated  in  his  own  hall,  but  remembering 
his  father's  injunctions,  said  no  more  than  what  became  him  as 
master  of  the  house,  though  young  and  protector  of  his  guests. 

Penelope  had  protracted  her  decision  in  favor  of  either  of  her 
suitors  so  long  that  there  seemed  to  be  no  further  pretence  for 
delay.  The  continued  absence  of  her  husband  seemed  to  prove 
that  his  return  was  no  longer  to  be  expected.  Meanwhile,  her 
son  had  grown  up,  and  was  able  to  manage  his  own  affairs.  She 
therefore  consented  to  submit  the  question  of  her  choice  to  a 
trial  of  skill  among  the  suitors.  The  test  selected  was  shooting 
with  the  bow.  Twelve  rings  were  arranged  in  a  line,  and  he 
whose  arrow  was  sent  through  the  whole  twelve  was  to  have  the 
queen  for  his  prize. 

*'  Who  now  can  bend  Ulysses'  bow  and  wing 
The  well-aimed  arrow  thro'  the  distant  ring 
Shall  end  the  strife." — Homer  (Pope). 

A.  bow  that  one  of  his  brother  heroes  had  given  to  Ulysses  in 
former  times  was  brought  from  the  armory,  and  with  its  quiver 
full  of  arrows  was  laid  in  the  hall.  Telemachus  had  taken  care 
that  all  other  weapons  should  be  removed,  under  pretence  that 
in  the  heat  of  competition  there  was  danger,  in  some  rash  mo- 
ment, of  putting  them  to  an  improper  use. 

All  things  being  prepared  for  the  trial,  the  first  thing  to  be 
done  was  to  bend  the  bow  in  order  to  attach  the  string.  Telem- 
achus endeavored  to  do  it,  but  found  all  his  efforts  fruitless,  and 
modestly  confessing  that  he  had  attempted  a  task  beyond  his 
stiength,  he  yielded  the  bow  to  another.  He  tried  it  with  no 
better  success,  and,  amidst  the  laughter  and  jeers  of  his  com- 
panions, gave  it  up.  Another  tried  it,  and  another ;  they  rubbed 
vhe  bow  with  tallow,  but  all  to  no  purpose  ;  it  would  not  bend. 
Then  spoke  Ulysses,  humbly  suggesting  that  he  should  be  per- 
mitted to  try ;  for,  said  he, 

**  Though  old  and  poor,  I  once  bore  arms  j 
Nor  is  the  bow  yet  strange  to  me." — HoMER. 

The  suitors  hooted  with  derision,  and  commanded  to  turn  him 


y  8  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES 

out  of  the  hall  for  his  insolence.  But  Telemachus  spoke  up  for 
him,  and  merely  to  gratify  the  old  man,  bade  him  try.  Ulysses 
took  the  bow  and  handled  it  with  the  hand  of  a  master.  With 
ease  he  adjusted  the  cord  to  its  notch ;  then  fitting  an  arrow  to 
the  bow,  he  drew  the  string  and  sped  the  arrow  unerring  through 
the  rings. 

Without  allowing  them  time  to  express  their  astonishment  he 
said,  **Now  for  another  mark  !"  and  aimed  direct  at  the  most 
insolent  one  of  the  suitors.  The  arrow  pierced  through  his  throat 
and  he  fell  dead.  Telemachus,  Eumaeus  and  another  faithful 
follower,  well  armed,  now  sprang  to  the  side  of  Ulysses.  The 
suitors,  in  amazement,  looked  round  for  arms,  but  found  none ; 
neither  was  there  any  way  of  escape,  for  Eumaeus  had  secured 
the  door.  Ulysses  left  them  not  long  in  uncertainty ;  he  an- 
nounced himself  as  the  long-lost  chief,  whose  house  they  had  in* 
vaded,  whose  substance  they  had  squandered,  whose  wife  and 
son  they  had  persecuted  for  ten  long  years,  and  told  them  he 
meant  to  have  ample  vengeance. 

**  Then  grimly  frowning  with  a  dreadful  look 
That  withered  all  their  hearts,  Ulysses  spoke : 
*  Dogs,  ye  have  had  your  day.'  " — Homer  (Pope). 

All  were  slain,  and  Ulysses  was  left  master  of  his  palace,  and 
possessor  of  his  kingdom  and  his  wife. 

**Come,  my  friends, 
'Tis  not  too  late  to  seek  a  newer  world. 
Push  off,  and  sitting  well  in  order  smite 
The  sounding  furrows ;  for  my  purpose  holds 
To  sail  beyond  the  sunset,  and  the  baths 
Of  all  the  western  stars,  until  I  die. 
It  may  be  that  the  gulfs  will  wash  us  down  ; 
It  may  be  we  shall  touch  the  Happy  Isles, 
And  see  the  great  Achilles  whom  we  knew." — Tennysc??

Adventures  of  iE-ne'as — The  Har'pies— Di'do — Pal-i-

Adventures  of  ^-ne'as. 

We  have  followed  one  of  the  Grecian  heroes,  Ulysses,  in  his 
wanderings,  on  his  return  home  from  Troy,  and  now  we  propose 
to  share  the  fortunes  of  the  remnant  of  the  conquered  people, 
under  their  chief  ^-ne'as,  in  their  search  for  a  new  home, 
after  the  ruin  of  their  native  city.  On  that  fatal  night  when  the 
wooden  horse  disgorged  its  contents  of  armed  men,  and  the  cap- 
ture and  conflagration  of  the  city  were  the  result,  ^neas  made 
his  escape  from  the  scene  of  destruction,  with  his  father,  and  his 
wife  and  young  son.  The  father,  Anchises,  was  too  old  to  walk 
with  the  speed  required,  and  ^neas  took  him  upon  his  shoulders. 

**  Come  then,  dear  father  !  on  my  shoulders  I 
Will  bear  thee,  nor  think  the  task  severe." 

— Virgil  (Cranch). 

Thus  burdened,  leading  his  son,  and  followed  by  his  wife,  he 
made  the  best  of  his  way  out  of  the  burning  city ;  but,  in  the 
confusion,  his  wife  was  swept  away  and  lost. 

On  arriving  at  the  place  of  rendezvous,  numerous  fugitives 
of  both  sexes  were  found,  who  put  themselves  under  the  guid- 
ance of  ^neas.  Some  months  were  spent  in  preparation,  and 
at  length  they  embarked.  They  first  landed  on  the  neighboring 
shores  of  Thrace,  and  were  preparing  to  build  a  city,  but  ^neas 
was  deterred  by  a  prodigy.  Preparing  to  offer  sacrifice,  he  tore 
some  twigs  from  one  of  the  bushes.  To  his  dismay  the  wounded 
part  dropped  blood. 

**  A  groan 
Grievous  to  hear  came  from  beneath  the  mound." — ^VlRGlL. 

When  he  repeated  the  act,  a  voice  from  the  ground  cried  out 
to  him,  "  Spare  me,  ^neas ;  I  am  your  kinsman,  Polydore,  here 


320  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 

murdered  with  many  arrows,  from  which  a  bush  has  grown,  nour- 
ished with  my  blood."  These  words  recalled  to  the  recollection 
of  ^neas  that  Polydore  was  a  young  prince  of  Troy,  whom  his 
father  had  sent  with  ample  treasures  to  the  neighboring  land  of 
Thrace,  to  be  there  brought  up,  at  a  distance  from  the  horrors 
of  war.  The  king  to  whom  he  was  sent  had  murdered  him  and 
seized  his  treasures,  ^neas  and  his  companions,  considering 
the  land  accursed  by  the  stain  of  such  a  crime,  hastened  away. 

They  next  landed  on  the  island  of  Delos,  which  was  once  a 
floating  island,  till  Jupiter  fastened  it  by  adamantine  chains  to 
the  bottom  of  the  sea.  Apollo  and  Diana  were  born  there,  and 
the  island  was  sacred  to  Apollo.  Here  ^neas  consulted  the 
oracle  of  Apollo,  and  received  an  answer,  ambiguous  as  usual, — 
**Seek  your  ancient  mother;  there  the  race  of  ^neas  shall 
dwell,  and  reduce  all  other  nations  to  their  sway. ' ' 

**  There  shall  ^^neas'  house,  renewed 
For  ages,  rule  a  world  subdued." 

— Virgil  (Conington's  tr.). 

The  Trojans  heard  with  joy,  and  immediately  began  to  ask 
one  another,  ''Where  is  the  spot  intended  by  the  oracle?" 
Anchises  remembered  that  there  was  a  tradition  that  their  fore- 
fathers came  from  Crete,  and  thither  they  resolved  to  steer. 
They  arrived  at  Crete  and  began  to  build  their  city,  but  sickness 
broke  out  among  them,  and  the  fields  that  they  had  planted 
failed  to  yield  a  crop.  In  this  gloomy  aspect  of  affairs  ^neas 
was  warned  in  a  dream  to  leave  the  country  and  seek  a  western 
land,  called  Hesperia,  whence  Dardanus,  the  true  founder  of  the 
Trojan  race,  had  originally  migrated.  To  Hesperia,  now  called 
Italy,  therefore,  they  directed  their  future  course,  and  not  till 
after  many  adventures,  and  the  lapse  of  time  sufficient  to  carry  a 
modern  navigator  several  times  round  the  world,  did  they  arrive 
there. 

The  Har'pies. 

Their  first  landing  was  at  the  island  of  the  Har'pies.  These 
were  disgusting  birds,  with  the  heads  of  maidens,  with  long  clawf 
and  faces  pale  with  hunger. 

*♦  Crooked  claws  for  hands, 
And  faces  with  perpetual  hunger  pale." — ViRGiL. 


THE  HARPIES.  32 1 

They  "vs-ere  sent  by  the  gods  to  torment  a  certain  Phineus, 
^hom  Jupiter  had  deprived  of  his  sight,  in  punishment  of  his 
cruelty ;  and  whenever  a  meal  was  placed  before  him,  the  Har- 
pies darted  down  from  the  air  and  carried  it  off.  They  were 
driven  away  from  Phineus  by  the  heroes  of  the  Argonautic  ex- 
pedition, and  took  refuge  in  the  island  where  ^neas  now  found 
them. 

When  they  entered  the  port  the  Trojans  saw  herds  of  cattle 
roaming  over  the  plain.  They  slew  as  many  as  they  wished,  and 
prepared  for  a  feast.  But  no  sooner  had  they  seated  themselves 
at  the  table  than  a  horrible  clamor  was  heard  in  the  air,  and  a 
flock  of  these  odious  harpies  came  rushing  down  upon  them, 
seizing  in  their  talons  the  meat  from  the  dishes,  and  flying  away 
with  it.  ^neas  and  his  companions  drew  their  swords  and 
dealt  vigorous  blows  among  the  monsters,  but  to  no  purpose, 
for  they  were  so  nimble  it  was  almost  impossible  to  hit  them, 
and  their  feathers  were  like  armor,  impenetrable  to  steel.  One 
of  them,  perched  on  a  neighboring  cliff,  screamed  out,  **Is  it 
thus,  Trojans,  you  treat  us  innocent  birds — first  slaughter  our 
cattle,  and  then  make  war  on  ourselves  ?'  *  She  then  predicted 
dire  sufferings  to  them  in  their  future  course,  and,  having  vented 
her  wrath,  flew  away.  The  Trojans  made  haste  to  leave  the 
country,  and  next  found  themselves  coasting  along  the  shore  of 
Epirus.  Here  they  landed,  and,  to  their  astonishment,  learned 
that  certain  Trojan  exiles,  who  had  been  carried  there  as  prison- 
.-srs,  had  become  rulers  of  the  country.  Andromache,  the  widow 
of  Hector,  became  the  wife  of  one  of  the  victorious  Grecian 
chiefs,  to  whom  she  bore  a  son.  Her  husband  dying,  she  was 
left  regent  of  the  country,  as  guardian  of  her  son,  and  had  mar- 
ried a  fellow-captive,  Helenus,  of  the  royal  race  of  Troy.  Hele- 
nus  and  Andromache  treated  the  exiles  with  the  utmost  hospi* 
tality,  and  dismissed  them  loaded  with  gifts. 

**  In  the  palace  halls 
They  pour  the  wine  and  drink 
From  cups  of  gold." — ViRGlL. 

From  hence  ^neas  coasted  along  the  shore  of  Sicily,  and 
passed  the  country  of  the  Cyclopes.  Here  they  were  hailed 
from  the  shore  by  a  miserable  object,  whom  by  his  garments 


322  STORIES  OF  OODS  AND  HEROES, 

tattered  as  they  were,  they  perceived  to  be  a  Greek.  He  told 
them  he  was  one  of  Ulysses's  companions,  left  behind  by  that 
chief  in  his  hurried  departure.  He  related  the  story  of  Ulysses's 
adventure  with  Polyphemus,  and  besought  them  to  take  him  off 
with  them,  as  he  had  no  means  of  sustaining  his  existence,  where 
'he  was,  but  wild  berries  and  roots,  and  lived  in  constant  fear  of 
the  Cyclopes.  While  he  spoke  Polyphemus  made  his  appear- 
ance; a  terrible  monster,  shapeless,  vast,  whose  only  eye  had 
been  put  out.^  He  walked  with  cautious  steps,  feeling  his  way 
with  a  staff,  down  to  the  sea -side,  to  wash  his  eye-socket  in  the 
waves.  When  he  reached  the  water  he  waded  out  towards 
them,  and  his  immense  height  enabled  him  to  advance  far  into 
the  sea,  so  that  the  Trojans,  in  terror,  took  to  their  oars  to  get 
out  of  his  way.  Hearing  the  oars,  Polyphemus  shouted  after 
them,  so  that  the  shores  resounded,  and  at  the  noise  the  other 
Cyclopes  came  forth  from  their  caves  and  woods,  and  lined  the 
shore,  like  a  row  of  lofty  pine  trees.  The  Trojans  plied  their 
oars,  and  soon  left  them  out  of  sight. 

.^neas  had  been  cautioned  by  Helenus  to  avoid  the  strait 
guarded  by  the  monsters  Scylla  and  Charybdis. 

**  The  whirlpool  sucks  the  waters  down. 
Then  spouts  them  forth  again, 
Lashing  the  very  stars." — ViRGlL. 

There  Ulysses,  the  reader  will  remember,  had  lost  six  of  his 
men,  seized  by  Scylla,  while  the  navigators  were  wholly  intent 
upon  avoiding  Charybdis.  ^neas,  following  the  advice  of 
Helenus,  shunned  the  dangerous  pass  and  coasted  along  the 
island  of  Sicily. 

Juno,  seeing  the  Trojans  speeding  their  way  prosperously  to^ 
wards  their  destined  shore,  felt  her  old  grudge  against  them  re- 
vive, for  she  could  not  forget  the  slight  that  Paris  had  put  upon 
her  in  awarding  the  prize  of  beauty  to  another.  In  heavenly 
minds  can  such  resentments  dwell  !*  Accordingly  she  hastened 
to  ^olus,  the  ruler  of  the  winds, — the  same  who  supplied  Ulysses 
with  favoring  gales,  giving  him  the  contrary  ones  tied  up  in  a 
bag,    .^olus  obeyed  the  goddess  and  sent  forth  his  sons,  Boreas,

Typhon,  and  the  other  winds,  to  toss  the  ocean.  A  teirible 
storm  ensued,  and  the  Trojan  ships  were  driven  out  of  their 
course  towards  the  coast  of  Africa.  They  were  in  imminent  dan- 
ger of  being  wrecked,  and  were  separated,  so  that  ^neas  thought 
that  all  were  lost  except  his  own. 

At  this  crisis,  Neptune,  hearing  the  storm  raging,  and  knowing 
that  he  had  given  no  orders  for  one,  raised  his  head  above  the 
Braves,  and  saw  the  fleet  of  ^neas  driving  before  the  gale. 
Knowing  the  hostility  of  Juno,  he  was  at  no  loss  to  account  for 
it,  but  his  anger  was  not  the  less  at  this  interference  in  his  prov- 
ince. He  called  the  winds,  and  dismissed  them  with  a  severe 
reprimand. 

**  *  Back  to  your  master  instant  flee, 
And  tell  him,  not  to  him  but  me 
The  imperial  trident  of  the  sea 
Fell  by  the  lot's  award.'  " 

— Virgil  (Comington's  tr. ). 

He  then  soothed  the  waves,  and  brushed  away  the  clouds  from 
before  the  face  of  the  sun.  Some  of  the  ships  which  had  got  on 
the  rocks  he  pried  off  with  his  own  trident,  while  Triton  and  a 
sea-nymph,  putting  their  shoulders  under  others,  set  them  afloat 
again.  The  Trojans,  when  the  sea  became  calm,  sought  the 
nearest  shore,  which  was  the  coast  of  Carthage,  where  ^neas 
was  so  happy  as  to  find  that  one  by  one  the  ships  all  arrived 
safe,  though  badly  shaken. 

Di'do. 

Carthage,  where  the  exiles  had  now  arrived,  was  a  spot  on  the 
coast  of  Africa  opposite  Sicily,  where  at  that  time  a  Tyrian  colony 
under  Di'do,  their  queen,  were  laying  the  foundations  of  a  state 
destined  in  later  ages  to  be  the  rival  of  Rome  itself.  Dido  wa.s 
the  daughter  of  Belus,  king  of  Tyre,  and  sister  of  Pygmalion, 
who  succeeded  his  father  on  the  throne.  Her  husband  was 
Sichaeus,  a  man  of  immense  wealth,  but  Pygmalion,  who  coveted 
his  treasures,  caused  him  to  be  put  to  death.  Dido,  with  a 
numerous  body  of  friends  and  followers,  both  men  and  women, 
succeeded  in  eff"ecting  their  escape  from  Tyre  in  several  vessels, 
carrying  with  them  the  treasures  of  Sichaeus.  On  arriving  at  the 
8pot  which  ihcy  selected  as  the  seat  of  their  future  home,  they 


324  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES 

asked  of  the  natives  only  so  much  land  as  they  could  enclose  with 
a  bull's  hide.  AVhen  this  was  readily  granted,  she  caused  the 
hide  to  be  cut  into  strips,  and  with  them  enclosed  a  spot  on  which 
she  built  a  citadel,  and  called  it  Byrsa  (a  hide).  Around  this  fort 
the  city  of  Carthage  rose,  and  soon  became  a  powerful  and  flour- 
ishing place. 

Such  was  the  state  of  affairs  when  -^neas  with  his  Trojans 
arrived  there.  Dido  received  the  illustrious  exiles  with  friend- 
liness and  hospitality.  **  Not  unacquainted  with  distress,"  she 
said,  *'  I  have  learned  to  succcor  the  unfortunate. '  '*  The  queen's 
hospitality  displayed  itself  in  festivities,  at  which  games  of  strength 
and  skill  were  exhibited.  The  strangers  contended  for  the  palm 
with  her  own  subjects,  on  equal  terms.     The  queen  consented. 

*  *  Draw  up 
Your  ships.     Trojans  and  Tyrians  from  me* 
Shall  no  distinction  know," — Virgil  (Cranch). 

At  the  feast  which  followed  the  games  ^neas  gave,  at  her  re- 
quest, a  recital  of  the  closing  events  of  the  Trojan  history  and  his 
own  adventures  after  the  fall  of  the  city.  Dido  was  charmed  with 
his  discourse  and  filled  with  admiration  of  his  exploits.  She  con- 
ceived an  ardent  passion  for  him,  and  he  for  his  part  seemed  well 
content  to  accept  the  fortunate  chance  which  appeared  to  offer 
him  at  once  a  happy  termination  of  his  wanderings,  a  home,  a 
kingdom,  and  a  bride.  Months  rolled  away  in  the  enjoyment 
of  pleasant  intercourse,  and  it  seemed  as  if  Italy  and  the  empire 
destined  to  be  founded  on  its  shores  were  alike  forgotten — seeing 
which,  Jupiter  despatched  Mercury  with  a  message  to  ^neas, 
recalling  him  to  a  sense  of  his  high  destiny,  and  commanding  him 
to  resume  his  voyage. 

^neas  parted  from  Dido,  though  she  tried  every  allurement 
and  persuasion  to  detain  him.  The  blow  to  her  affection  and 
her  pride  was  too  much  for  her  to  endure,  and  when  she  found 
that  he  was  gone  she  mounted  a  funeral  pile  which  she  had  caused 
to  be  prepared,  and  having  stabbed  herself  was  consumed  with 
the  pile.  The  flames  rising  over  the  city  were  seen  by  the  de- 
parting Trojans,  and  though  the  cause  was  unknown,  gave  to 
^neas  some  intimation  of  the  fatal  event.

PALINURUS,  325 

•*  These  flames  the  cruel  Trojan  on  the  sea 
Shall  drink  in  with  his  eyes." — Virgil  (Cranch). 

Pal-i-nu'rus. 

After  touching  at  the  island  of  Sicily,  where  Acestes,  a  prince 
of  Trojan  lineage,  bore  sway,  who  gave  them  a  hospitable  recep- 
tion, the  Trojans  re-embarked  and  held  on  their  course  for  Italy. 
Venus  now  interceded  with  Neptune  to  allow  her  son  at  last  tc 
attain  the  wished-for  goal  and  find  an  end  of  his  perils  on  the 
deep.  Neptune  consented,  stipulating  only  for  one  life  as  a  ran- 
som for  the  rest.  The  victim  was  Pal-i-nu'rus,  the  pilot.  As 
he  sat  watching  the  stars,  with  his  hand  on  the  helm,  Somnus, 
sent  by  Neptune,  approached  in  the  guise  of  Phorbas  and  said, 
**  Palinurus,  the  breeze  is  fair,  the  water  smooth,  and  the  ship 
sails  steadily  on  her  course.  Lie  down  awhile  and  take  needful 
rest.  I  will  stand  at  the  helm  in  your  place. ' '  Palinurus  replied, 
**  Tell  me  not  of  smooth  seas  or  favoring  winds, — me  who  have 
seen  so  much  of  their  treachery.  Shall  I  trust  ^neas  to  the 
chances  of  the  weather  and  the  winds  ?' ' 

**  And  clinging  to  the  helm 
Held  fast,  and  fixed  his  eyes  upon  the  stars." — ViRGiL  (Cranch). 

r 

But  Somnus  waved  over  him  a  branch  moistened  with  Lethaean 
dew,  and  his  eyes  closed  in  spite  of  all  his  efforts.  Then  Somnus 
pushed  him  overboard  and  he  fell ;  but,  keeping  his  hold  upon 
the  helm,  it  came  away  with  him.  Neptune  was  mindful  of  his 
promise,  and  kept  the  ship  on  her  track  without  helm  or  pilot, 
till  ^neas  discovered  his  loss,  and,  sorrowing  deeply  for  his 
faithful  steersman,  took  charge  of  the  ship  himself. 

The  ships  at  last  reached  the  shores  of  Italy,  and  joyfully  did 
the  adventurers  leap  to  land. 

*•  And  Italy  rings  first 
Achates'  voice,  and  Italy  with  shouts 
Of  joy  the  comrades  greet." — ^NEID  (Cranch). 

While  his  people  were  employed  in  making  their  encampment 
^neas  sought  the  abode  of  the  Sibyl.  It  was  a  cave  connected 
with  a  temple  and  grove,  sacred  to  Apollo  and  Diana.  While 
/Eneas  contemplated  the  scene,  the  Sibyl  accosted  him.     She 


326  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES 

seemed  to  know  his  errand,  and  under  the  influence  of  the  deitj 
of  the  place  burst  forth  in  a  prophetic  strain,  giving  dark  inti- 
mations of  labors  and  perils  through  which  he  was  destined  to 
make  his  way  to  final  success.  She  closed  with  the  encouraging 
words  which  have  become  proverbial :  *  *  Yield  not  to  disasters, 
but  press  onward  the  more  bravely. ' '  *  ^neas  replied  that  he 
had  prepared  himself  for  whatever  might  await  him.  He  had 
but  one  request  to  make.  Having  been  directed  in  a  dream  to 
seek  the  abode  of  the  dead  in  order  to  confer  with  his  father, 
Anchises,  to  receive  from  him  a  revelation  of  his  future  fortunes 
and  those  of  his  race,  he  asked  her  assistance  to  enable  him  to 
accomplish  the  task.     The  Sibyl  replied, 

**  To  the  shades  you  go  a  down-hill,  easy  way;* 
But  to  return  and  re-enjoy  the  day, 
This  is  a  work,  a  labor  !" — ^VlRGlL. 

She  instructed  him  to  seek  in  the  forest  a  tree  on  which  grew  a 
golden  branch.  This  branch  was  to  be  plucked  off  and  borne 
as  a  gift  to  Proserpine,  and  if  fate  was  propitious  it  would  yield 
to  the  hand  and  quit  its  parent  trunk,  but  otherwise  no  force 
could  rend  it  away.     If  torn  away,  another  would  succeed.^ 

^neas  followed  the  directions  of  the  Sibyl.  His  mother, 
Venus,  sent  two  of  her  doves  to  fly  before  him  and  show  him  the 
way,  and  by  their  assistance  he  found  the  tree,  plucked  the 
branch,  and  hastened  back  with  it  to  the  Sibyl. 

*'  With  eager  hand 
^neas  grasps  and  breaks  the  lingering  branch, 
And  to  the  Sybil's  dwelling  bears  it  off." — Virgil  (Cranch).

CHAPTER  XXXII. 
The  Infernal  Regions— The  Sib'ylc 

The  Infernal  Regions. 

As  at  the  commencement  of  our  series  we  have  given  the 
pagan  account  of  the  creation  of  the  world,  so,  as  we  approach 
its  conclusion,  we  present  a  view  of  the  regions  of  the  dead,  de- 
picted by  one  of  their  most  en- 
lightened poets,  who  drew  his 
doctrines  from  their  most  es- 
teemed philosophers.  The  re- 
gion where  Virgil  locates  the 
entrance  into  this  abode  is,  per- 
haps, the  most  strikingly  adapted 
to  excite  ideas  of  the  terrific  and 
preternatural  of  any  on  the  face 
of  the  earth.  It  is  the  volcanic 
region  near  Vesuvius,  where  the 
whole  country  is  cleft  with 
chasms  from  which  sulphurous 
flames  arise,  while  the  ground  is 
shaken  with  pent-up  vapors,  and 
mysterious  sounds  issue  from  the 
bowls  of  the  earth.  The  lake 
Avemus  is  supposed  to  fill  the 
crater  of  an  extinct  volcano.  It 
\s  circular,  half  a  mile  wide  and 

/ery  deep,  surrounded  by  high  banks,  which  in  Virgil's  time 
were  covered  with  a  gloomy  forest.  Mephitic  vapors  rise  from 
its  waters,  so  that  no  life  is  found  on  its  banks,  and  no  birds  fly 
over  it.  Here,  according  to  the  poet,  was  the  cave  which  aff'orded 
access  to  the  infernal  regions,  and  here  .^neas  off*ered  sacrifices 
to  the  infernal  deities,  Proserpine,  Hecate,  and  the  Furies.  Then 
4  roaring  was  heard  in  the  earth,  the  woods  on  the  hill-tops  were

shaken,  and  the  howling  of  dogs  announced  the  approach  of  th6 
deities.  **  Now,"  said  the  Sib'yl,  "summon  up  your  courage, 
for  you  will  need  it. ' '  She  descended  into  the  cave,  and  ^neas 
followed.  Pluto  sat  upon  his  throne,  and  by  him  were  the  three 
Fates,  with  their  thread  and  shears.  One  spun  the  thread  of  life 
and  another  twisted  its  bright  and  dark  lines  together,  and  an 
other  severed  it  at  will. 

**  Twist  ye,  twine  ye  !  even  so, 
Mingle  shades  of  joy  and  woe, 
Hope,  and  fear,  and  peace,  and  strife. 
In  the  thread  of  human  life." — ScOTT. 

Before  the  threshold  of  hell  they  passed  through  a  group  of 
beings  who  are  enumerated  as  Griefs  and  avenging  Cares,  pale 
Diseases  and  melancholy  Age,  Fear  and  Hunger  that  tempt  to 
crime.  Toil,  Poverty  and  Death,  forms  horrible  to  view.  The 
Furies  spread  their  couches  there,  and  Discord,  whose  hair  was 
of  vipers  tied  up  with  a  bloody  fillet.  Here  also  were  the  mon- 
sters, Briareus  with  his  hundred  arms.  Hydras  hissing,  and  Chi- 
maeras  breathing  fire,  ^neas  shuddered  at  the  sight,  drew  his 
sv;ord  and  would  have  struck,  but  the  Sibyl  restrained  him.  They 
then  came  to  the  black  river  Cocytus,  where  they  found  the  ferry- 
man, Charon,  old  and  squalid,  but  strong  and  vigorous,  who  was 
receiving  passengers  of  all  kinds  into  his  boat,  magnanimous 
hero^iS,  boys  and  unmarried  girls,  as  numerous  as  the  leaves  that 
fall  at  autumn,  or  the  flocks  that  fly  southward  at  the  approach 
of  winter.  They  stood  pressing  for  a  passage  and  longing  to 
touch  the  opposite  shore.  But  the  stern  ferryman  took  in  only 
such  as  he  chose,  driving  the  rest  back,  ^neas,  wondering  at 
the  sight,  asked  the  Sibyl,  **  Why  this  discrimination?'*  She 
answered : 

•*  No  one  may  pass 
Those  dreadful  waves  until  his  bones  repose 
Within  a  quiet  grave.     A  hundred  years 
They  wander,  flitting  all  around  these  shores, 
Until  at  last  they  cross  the  wished-for  lake." 

— iENElD  (Cranch). 

.^neas  grieved  at  recollecting  some  of  his  own  companions 
who  had  perished  in  the  storm.     At  that  moment  he  beheld

site  shore.  But  the  Sibyl  rebuked  him  for  the  wish  thus  to  trans- 
gress  the  laws  of  Pluto,  but  consoled  him  by  informing  him  that 
the  people  of  the  shore  where  his  body  had  been  wafted  by  the 
waves  should  be  stirred  up  by  prodigies  to  give  it  due  burial, 
and  that  the  promontory  should  bear  the  name  of  Cape  Palinurus, 
which  it  does  to  this  day.  Leaving  Palinurus  consoled  by  these 
words,  they  approached  the  boat.  Charon,  fixing  his  eyes  sternly 
upon  the  advancing  warrior,  demanded  by  Avhat  right  he,  living 
and  armed,  approached  that  shore.  To  which  the  Sibyl  replied 
that  they  would  commit  no  violence,  that  Eneas' s  only  object 
was  to  see  his  father,  and  finally  exhibited  the  golden  branch,  at 
sight  of  which  Charon's  wrath  relaxed,  and  he  made  haste  to  turn 
his  bark  to  the  shore  and  receive  them  on  board.  The  boat, 
adapted  only  to  the  light  freight  of  bodiless  spirits,  groaned  under 
the  weight  of  the  hero.  They  were  soon  conveyed  to  the  oppo- 
site shore.  There  they  were  encountered  by  the  three -headed 
dog  Cerberus,  w^ith  his  necks  bristling  with  snakes.  He  barked 
with  all  his  three  throats  till  the  Sibyl  threw  him  a  medicated 
cake,  which  he  eagerly  devoured,  and  then  stretched  himself  out 
in  his  den  and  fell  asleep,  ^neas  and  the  Sibyl  sprang  to  land. 
The  first  sound  that  struck  their  ears  was  the  wailing  of  young 
children  who  had  died  on  the  threshold  of  life,  and  near  to  these 
were  they  who  had  perished  under  false  charges.  Minos  presides 
over  them  as  judge,  and  examines  the  deeds  of  each. 

**  Minos  shakes  them  ;  he  calls 
The  silent  multitude,  and  learns  from  each 
The  story  of  his  life  and  crimes." — iENEiD  (Cranch). 

The  next  class  was  of  those  who  had  died  by  their  own  hand, 
hating  life  and  seeking  refuge  in  death.  O,  how  willingly  would 
they  now  endure  poverty,  labor,  and  any  other  infliction,  if  they 
might  but  return  to  life  !  Next  were  situated  the  regions  of  sad- 
ness, divided  off  into  retired  paths,  leading  through  groves  of 
myrtle.  Here  roamed  those  who  had  fallen  victims  to  unre- 
quited love,  not  freed  from  pain  even  by  death  itself  Among 
these,  ^neas  thought  he  descried  the  form  of  Dido,  with  a  wound 
still  recent.  In  the  dim  light  he  was  for  a  moment  uncertain, 
but  approaching,  perceived  it  was  indeed  herself  Tears  fell 
from  his  eyes,  and  he  addressed  her  in  the  accents  of  love.    **  Un-

happy  Dido  !  was  then  the  rumor  true  that  you  had  perished  ? 
and  was  I,  alas  !  the  cause  ?  1  call  the  gods  to  witness  that  my 
departure  from  you  was  reluctant,  and  in  obedience  to  the  com 
mands  of  Jove  ;  nor  could  1  believe  that  my  absence  would  have 
cost  you  so  dear.  Stop,  I  beseech  you,  and  refuse  me  not  a  last 
farewell."  She  stood  for  a  moment  with  averted  countenance 
and  eyes  fixed  on  the  ground,  and  then  silently  passed  on,  as  in 
sensible  to  his  pleadings  as  a  rock,  ^neas  followed  for  some 
distance ;  then,  with  a  heavy  heart,  rejoined  his  companion  ana 
resumed  his  route. 

They  next  entered  the  fields  where  roam  the  heroes  who  had 
fallen  in  battle.  Here  they  saw  many  shades  of  Grecian  and 
Trojan  warriors.  The  Trojans  thronged  around  him,  and  could 
not  be  satisfied  with  the  sight.  They  asked  the  cause  of  his 
coming,  and  plied  him  with  innumerable  questions.  But  the 
Greeks,  at  the  sight  of  his  armor  glittering  through  the  murky 
atmosphere,  recognized  the  hero,  and,  filled  with  terror,  turned 
their  backs  and  fled,  as  they  used  to  do  on  the  plains  of  Troy. 

**  This  way  for  us 
Into  Elysium,  while  the  left  way  sends 
The  wicked  to  their  punishment." — /Eneid. 

^neas  would  have  lingered  long  with  his  Trojan  friends,  but 
the  Sibyl  hurried  him  away.  They  next  came  to  a  place  where 
the  road  divided,  the  one  leading  to  Elysium,  the  other  to  the 
regions  of  the  condemned,  ^neas  beheld  on  one  side  the  walls 
of  a  mighty  city,  around  which  Phlegethon  rolled  its  fiery 
waters.  Before  him  was  the  gate  of  adamant  that  neither  gods 
nor  men  can  break  through.  An  iron  tower  stood  by  the  gate, 
on  which  Tisiphone,  the  avenging  Fury,  kept  guard.  From  the 
city  were  heard  groans,  and  the  sound  of  the  scourge,  the  creak- 
ing of  iron,  and  the  clanking  of  chains,  ^neas,  horror-struck, 
inquired  of  his  guide  what  crimes  were  those  whose  punishments 
produced  the  sounds  he  heard  ?  The  Sibyl  answered,  **  Here  is 
the  judgment-hall  of  Rhadahianthus,  who  brings  to  light  crimes 
done  in  life,  which  the  perpetrator  vainly  thought  impenetrably 
hid.  Tisiphone  applies  her  whip  of  scorpions,  and  delivers  the 
offender  over  to  her  sister  Furies."  At  this  moment,  with  horrid 
rlang,  the  brazen  gates  unfolded,  and  ^neas  saw  within  a  Hydraj,

with  fifty  heads,  guarding  the  entrance.  The  Sibyl  told  him  that 
the  gulf  of  Tartarus  descended  deep,  so  that  its  recesses  were  as 
far  beneath  their  feet  as  heaven  was  high  above  their  heads.  In 
the  bottom  of  this  pit  the  Titan  race,  who  warred  against  the 
gods,  lie  prostrate ;  Salmoneus,  also,  who  presumed  to  vie  with 
Jupiter,  and  built  a  bridge  of  brass  over  which  he  drove  his 
chariot,  that  the  sound  might  resemble  thunder,  launching  flaming 
brands  at  his  people  in  imitation  of  lightning,  till  Jupiter  struck 
him  with  a  real  thunderbolt,  and  taught  him  the  diff"erence 
between  mortal  weapons  and  divine.  Here  also  is  Tityus,  the 
giant,  whose  form  is  so  immense  that  as  he  lies  he  stretches  over 
nine  acres,  while  a  vulture  preys  upon  his  liver,  which  as  fast  as 
it  is  devoured  grows  again,  so  that  his  punishment  will  have  no 
end. 

^neas  saw  groups  seated  at  tables  loaded  with  dainties,  while 
near  by  stood  a  Fury,  who  snatched  away  the  viands  from  their 
lips  as  fast  as  they  prepared  to  taste  them. 

'*  And  beside  them  sits 
The  queen  of  Furies,  and  forbids  to  touch 
The  food."— Virgil. 

Others  beheld  suspended  over  their  heads  huge  rocks,  threat- 
ening to  fall,  keeping  them  in  a  state  of  constant  alarm.  These 
were  they  who  had  hated  their  brothers,  or  struck  their  parents,  or 
defrauded  the  friends  who  trusted  them,  or  who,  having  grown 
rich,  kept  their  money  to  themselves  and  gave  no  share  to  others — 
the  last  being  the  most  numerous  class.  Here  also  were  those 
who  had  violated  the  marriage-vow,  or  fought  in  a  bad  cause,  or 
failed  in  fidelity  to  their  employers.  Here  was  one  who  had  sold 
his  country  for  gold ;  another  who  perverted  the  laws,  making 
them  say  one  thing  to-day  and  another  to-morrow. 

Ixion  was  there,  fastened  to  the  circumference  of  a  wheel  cease- 
lessly revolving. 

**  Proud  Ixion,  doom'd  to  feel 
The  tortures  of  the  eternal  wheel." 

— Sophocles  (Francklin'str.). 

And  Sisyphus,  whose  task  was  to  roll  a  hugh  stone  up  to  a  hill-

by  some  sudden  force,  rushed  again  headlong  down  to  the  plain.

Again  he  toiled  at  it,  while  the  sweat  bathed  all  his  weary  limbsi 
but  all  to  no  effect. 

"  With  many  a  weary  step  and  many  a  groan, 
Up  the  high  hill  he  heaves  a  huge  round  stone." 

— Homer  (Pope's  tr.). 

There  was  Tantalus,  who  stood  in  a  pool,  his  chin  level  with 
the  water,  yet  he  was  parched  with  thirst,  and  found  nothing  to 
assuage  it ;  for  when  he  bowed  his  hoary  head,  eager  to  quaff, 
the  water  fled  away,  leaving  the  ground  at  his  feet  all  dry.  Tall 
trees  laden  with  fruit  stooped  their  heads  to  him — pears,  pome- 
granates, apples,  and  luscious  figs ;  but  when,  with  a  sudden 
grasp,  he  tried  to  seize  them,  winds  whirled  them  high  above  his 

reach. 

*•  The  fruit  he  strives  to  seize,  but  blasts  arise, 
Toss  it  on  high,  and  whirl  it  to  the  skies." 

— Homer  fPope'str. ). 

The  Sibyl  now  warned  ^neas  that  it  was  time  to  turn  from 
these  melancholy  regions  and  seek  the  city  of  the  blessed.  They 
passed  through  a  middle  tract  of  darkness  and  came  upon  the 
Elysian  fields,  the  groves  where  the  happy  reside.  They  breathed 
a  freer  air,  and  saw  all  objects  clothed  in  a  purple  light.  The 
region  has  a  sun  and  stars  of  its  own.  The  inhabitants  were  en- 
joying themselves  in  various  ways — some  in  sports  on  the  grassy 
turf,  in  games  of  strength  or  skill ;  others  dancing  or  singing. 
Orpheus  struck  the  chords  of  his  lyre,  and  called  forth  ravishing 
sounds.  Here  yEneas  saw  the  founders  of  the  Trojan  state, 
magnanimous  heroes,  who  lived  in  happier  times.  He  gazed 
with  admiration  on  the  war-chariots  and  glittering  arms  now  re- 
posing in  disuse.  Spears  stood  fixed  in  the  ground,  and  the 
horses,  unharnessed,  roamed  over  the  plain.  The  same  pride 
in  splendid  armor  and  generous  steeds  which  the  old  heroes  felt 
in  life  accompanied  them  here.  He  saw  another  group  feast- 
ing and  listening  to  the  strains  of  music.  They  were  in  a  laurel 
grove,  whence  the  great  river  Po  has  its  origin,  and  flows  out 
among  men.  Here  dwelt  those  who  fell  by  wounds  received  in 
their  country's  cause ;  holy  priests,  also,  and  poets  who  have  ut- 
tered thoughts  worthy  of  Apollo,  and  others  who  have  contribu- 
ted to  cheer  and  adorn  life  by  their  discoveries  in  the  useful  arts,

mankind. 

«•  Patriots  who  perished  for  their  country's  rights, 
Or  nobly  triumphed  in  the  fields  of  light ; 
There  holy  priests  and  sacred  poets  stood, 
Who  sang  with  all  the  raptures  of  a  god : 
Worthies  whose  lives  by  useful  arts  refined. 
With  those  who  leave  a  deathless  name  behind. 
Friends  of  the  world  and  fathers  of  mankind." — Virgil. 

The7  wore  snow-white  fillets  about  their  brows.  The  Sibyl  ad 
dressed  a  group  of  these,  and  inquired  where  Anchises  was  to 
be  found.  They  were  directed  where  to  seek  him,  and  soon 
found  him  in  a  verdant  valley,  where  he  was  contemplating  the 
ranks  of  his  posterity,  their  destinies  and  worthy  deeds  to  be 
achieved  in  coming  times.  When  he  recognized  ^neas  ap- 
proaching, he  stretched  out  both  hands  to  him,  while  tears 
flowed  freely.  **Have  you  come  at  last,'*  said  he,  "long  ex- 
pected, and  do  I  behold  you  after  such  perils  past  ?  O,  my  son, 
how  have  I  trembled  for  you  as  I  have  watched  your  career  !*' 
To  which  ^neas  replied,  "  O,  father  1  your  image  was  always 
before  me  to  guide  and  guard  me.**  Then  he  endeavored  to 
enfold  his  father  in  his  embrace,  but  his  arms  enclosed  only  an 
unsubstantial  image, 

**  And  vanished  like  a  winged  dream  away.** 

.^neas  perceived  before  him  a  spacious  valley,  with  ti-ees 
gently  waving  to  the  wind — ^a  tranquil  landscape — through  wUicla 
the  river  Lethe  flowed. 

•*  Her  wat'ry  labyrinth,  whereof  who  drinks 
Forthwith  his  fonner  state  and  being  forgets— 
Forgets  both  joy  and  grief,  pleasure  and  pain."'^MlLTON. 

A-long  the  banks  of  the  stream  wandered  a  countless  multitude, 
numerous  as  insects  in  the  summer  air.  ^neas,  with  surprise, 
mquired  who  were  these.  Anchises  answered,  "They  are 
souls  to  which  bodies  are  to  be  given  in  due  time.  Meanwhile 
rhey  dwell  on  Lethe's  bank,  and  drink  oblivion  of  their  former 
lives."  **0,  father  !'*  said  yEneae,  **is  it  possible  that  any 
can  be  so  in  love  with  life  as^  to  wish  tc  leave  these  tranquil  seats

for  the  upper  world  ?"  Anchises  replied  by  explaining  the  plan 
of  creation.  The  Creator,  he  told  him,  originally  made  the 
material  of  which  souls  are  composed  of  the  four  elements — fire, 
air,  earth,  and  water ;  all  which,  when  united,  took  the  form  of 
the  most  excellent  part,  fire,  and  became  flame.  This  material 
was  scattered  like  seed  among  the  heavenly  bodies,  the  sun. 
moon  and  stars. 

**  The  heavens,  the  earth,  the  flowing  sea. 
By  one  interior  spirit  are  sustained  ; 
One  mind  quickens  the  mass  entire. 
And  minghng,  stirs  the  mighty  frame." — ^NEID. 

Of  this  seed  the  inferior  gods  created  man  and  all  other  ani- 
mals, mingling  it  with  various  proportions  of  earth,  by  which  its 
purity  was  alloyed  and  reduced.  Thus  the  more  earth  predomi- 
nates in  the  composition,  the  less  pure  is  the  individual ;  and 
we  see  men  and  women  with  their  full-grown  bodies  have  not 
the  purity  of  childhood.  So,  in  proportion  to  the  time  which  the 
union  of  body  and  soul  has  lasted,  is  the  impurity  contracted  by 
the  spiritual  part.  This  impurity  must  be  purged  away  after 
death,  which  is  done  by  ventilating  the  souls  in  the  current  of 
winds,  or  merging  them  in  water,  or  burning  out  their  impurities 
by  fire.  Some  few,  of  whom  Anchises  intimates  that  he  is  one, 
are  admitted  at  once  to  Elysium,  there  to  remain.  But  the  rest, 
after  the  impurities  of  earth  are  purged  away,  are  sent  back  to 
Mfe  endowed  with  new  bodies,  having  had  the  remembrance  of 
their  fonner  lives  effectually  washed  away  by  the  waters  of  Lethe. 
Some,  however,  there  still  are,  so  thoroughly  corrupted  that  they 
are  not  fit  to  be  intrusted  with  human  bodies,  and  these  are  made 
into  brute  animals. 

"  Our  ills  do  not  depart  when  lifers 
Last  ray  has  fled.     We  all  endure 
Our  ghostly  retribution." — Virgil. 

This  is  what  the  ancients  called  Metempsychosis,  or  the  trans- 
migration of  souls — a  doctrine  which  is  still  held  by  the  natives 
of  India,  who  scruple  to  destroy  the  life  even  of  the  most  insig- 
nificant animal,  not  knowiiv  but  it  may  be  one  of  their  relations 
Hi  an  altered  form. 


ELYSIUM.  337 

Anchises,  having  explained  so  much,  proceeded  to  point  out 
to  yi^neas  individuals  of  his  race  who  were  hereafter  to  be  born» 
and  to  relate  to  him  the  exploits  they  should  perform  in  the 
world.  After  this  he  reverted  to  the  present,  and  told  his  son 
of  the  events  that  remained  to  him  to  be  accomplished  before 
the  complete  establishment  of  himself  and  his  followers  in  Italy, 

**  Anchises  showed  ^^neas,  in  long  line, 
The  illustrious  shades  of  those  who  were  to  shine 
One  day  the  glory  of  the  Italian  shore." 

— ^TOMAS  DE  IrIARTE. 

Wars  were  to  be  waged,  battles  fought,  a  bride  to  be  won,  and 
hi  the  result  a  Trojan  state  founded,  from  which  should  rise  the 
Roman  power,  to  be  in  time  the  sovereign  of  the  world. 

^neas  and  the  Sibyl  then  took  leave  of  Anchises,  and  re- 
turned by  some  short  route,  which  the  poet  does  not  explain,  to 
the  upper  world. 

E-lys'i-um, 

Virgil,  we  have  seen,  places  his  E-lys'i-um  under  the  earth, 
and  assigns  it  for  a  residence  to  the  spirits  of  the  blessed.  But 
in  Homer  Elysium  forms  no  part  of  the  realms  of  the  dead.  He 
places  it  on  the  west  of  the  earth,  near  Ocean,  and  describes 
it  as  a  happy  land,  where  there  is  neither  snow,  nor  cold,  nor 
rain,  and  always  fanned  by  the  delightful  breezes  of  Zephyrus. 
Hither  favored  heroes  pass  without  dying,  and  live  happy  under 
the  rule  of  Rhadamanthus. 

**  And  every  bird  that  singeth  sweet. 
Throstle,  and  merle,  and  nightingale, 
Brings  blossoms  from  the  dewy  vale, 
Lily,  and  rose,  and  asphodel. 
With  these  doth  each  guest  twine  his  crown 
And  wreathe  his  cup  and  lay  him  down 
Beside  some  friend  he  loveth  well." — Andrew  Lang. 

The  Elysium  of  Hesiod  and  Pindar  is  in  the  Isles  of  the 
Blessed,  or  Fortunate  Islands,  in  the  Western  Ocean.  From 
<  hese  sprang  the  legend  of  the  happy  island  Atlantis.  This  bliss- 
i'jJ   region  may  have  bee;\  jvholly  imaginary,  but  possibly  may

have  sprung  from  the  reports  of  some  storm -driven  mariners  who 
bad  caught  a  glimpse  of  the  coast  of  America. 

**  Like  those  Hesperian  gardens  famed  of  old, 
Fortunate  fields  and  groves  and  flowery  vales, 
Thrice  happy  isles." — Milton. 

The  Sib'yl. 

As  ^neas  and  the  Sib'yl  pursued  their  way  back  to  earth,  he 
said  to  her,  **  Whether  thou  be  a  goddess  or  a  mortal  beloved  of 
the  gods,  by  me  thou  shalt  always  be  held  in  reverence.  When 
I  reach  the  upper  air  I  will  cause  a  temple  to  be  built  to  thy 
honor,  and  will  myself  bring  offerings."  **  I  am  no  goddess," 
said  the  Sibyl ;  **  I  have  no  claim  to  sacrifice  or  offering.  I  am 
mortal ;  yet  if  I  could  have  accepted  the  love  of  Apollo  I  might 
have  been  immortal.  He  promised  me  the  fulfilment  of  my 
wish  if  I  would  consent  to  be  his.  I  took  a  handful  of  sand, 
and  holding  it  forth  said,  *  Grant  me  to  see  as  many  birthday?  as 
there  are  sand-grains  in  my  hand.* 

**  For  constant  youth  I  asked  hira  not. 
Hence  age  has  come,  while  yet  my  death  is  far  away.** 

I  have  lived  seven  hundred  years,  and  to  equal  the  number  of 
the  sand-grains  I  have  still  to  see  three  hundred  springs  and 
three  hundred  harvests.  My  body  shrinks  up  as  years  increase, 
and  in  time  I  shall  be  lost  to  sight ;  but  my  voice  will  remain, 
and  future  ages  will  respect  my  sayings." 

These  concluding  words  of  the  Sibyl  alluded  to  her  prophetic 
power.  In  her  cave  she  was  accustomed  to  inscribe  on  leaves 
gathered  from  the  trees  the  names  and  fates  of  individuals.  The 
leaves  thus  inscribed  were  arranged  in  order  within  the  cave,  and 
might  be  consulted  by  her  votaries.  But  if  perchance  at  the 
opening  of  the  door  the  wind  rushed  in  and  dispersed  the  leaves, 
the  Sibyl  gave  no  aid  to  restoring  them  again,  and  the  oracle 
was  irreparably  lost. 

**  Do  not  write 
Tby  prophecies  on  leaves,  lest,  blown  about, 
They  fly,  the  sport  of  fitful  winds." — ViRGiL. 

The  following  legend  of  the  Sibyl  is  fixed  at  a  later  date.     Id

the  reign  of  one  of  the  Tarquins  there  appeared  before  the  king 
a  woman  who  offered  him  nine  books  for  sale.  The  king  refused 
to  purchase  them,  whereupon  the  woman  went  away  and  burned 
three  of  the  books,  and  returning  offered  the  remaining  books 
for  the  same  price  she  had  asked  for  the  nine.  The  king  again 
rejected  them  ;  but  when  the  woman,  after  burning  three  booka 
more,  returned  and  asked  for  the  three  remaining  the  same  price 
which  she  had  before  asked  for  the  nine,  his  curiosity  was  ex 
cited,  and  he  purchased  the  books. 

"As  worldly  schemes  resemWe  Sibyl's  leaves, 
The  good  man's  days  to  Sibyl's  books  compare, 
The  price  still  rising  as  in  number  less." — YoUNG. 

They  were  found  to  contain  the  destinies  of  the  RomM 
state.  They  were  kept  in 
the  temple  of  Jupiter  Cap- 
itolinus,  preserved  in  a 
stone  chest,  and  allowed  to 
be  inspected  only  by  es- 
pecial officers  appointed  for 
that  duty,  who  on  great  oc- 
casions consulted  them  and 
interpreted  their  oracles  to 
the  people. 

There  were  numerous 
Sibyls;  but  the  Cumaean 
Sibyl,  of  whom  Ovid  and 
Virgil  write,  is  the  most  cele- 
brated. Ovid's  story  of 
her  life  protracted  to  one 
thousand  years  may  be  in- 
tended to  represent  the  vari- 
ous Sibyls  as  being  only  re- 
appearances of  one  and  the  ^  O-U  I   Ik*    A       »    /c-  ^

^NEAS,  having  parted  from  the  Sibyl  and  rejoined  his  fleet, 
coasted  along  the  shores  of  Italy  and  cast  anchor  in  the  mouth 
of  the  Tiber.  The  poet  Virgil,  having  brought  his  hero  to  this 
spot,  the  destined  termination  of  his  wanderings,  invokes  his 
Muse  to  tell  him  the  situation  of  things  at  that  eventful  moment. 
Latinus,  third  in  descent  from  Saturn,  ruled  the  country.  He 
was  now  old  and  had  no  male  descendant,  but  had  one  charming 
daughter,  Lavinia,  who  was  sought  in  marriage  by  many  neigh- 
boring chiefs,  one  of  whom,  Turnus,  king  of  the  Rutulians,  was 
favored  by  the  wishes  of  her  parents.  But  Latinus  had  been 
warned  in  a  dream  by  his  father,  Faunus,  that  the  destined  hus- 
band of  Lavinia  should  come  from  a  foreign  land.  From  that 
union  should  spring  a  race  destined  to  subdue  the  world. 

Our  readers  will  remember  that  in  the  conflict  with  the  Har- 
pies, one  of  those  half-human  birds  had  threatened  the  Trojans 
with  dire  sufferings.  In  particular  she  predicted  that  before 
their  wanderings  ceased  they  should  be  pressed  by  hunger  to 
devour  their  tables.  This  portent  now  came  true ;  for  as  they 
took  their  scanty  meal,  seated  on  the  grass,  the  men  placed  their 
hard  biscuit  on  their  laps,  and  put  thereon  whatever  their  glean ' 
ings  in  the  woods  supplied.  Having  despatched  the  latter  they 
finished  by  eating  the  crusts.  Seeing  which,  the  boy  lulus  said, 
playfully,  **  See,  we  are  eating  our  tables.'*  ^neas  caught  the 
words  and  accepted  the  omen.  **  All  hail,  promised  land  !"  he 
exclaimed;  "this  is  our  home,  this  our  country!"  He  then 
took  measures  to  find  out  who  were  the  present  inhabitants  of  the 
land,  and  who  their  rulers.  A  hundred  chosen  men  were  sent 
to  the  village  of  Latinus,   bearing  presents  and  a  request  foi

friendship  and  alliance.  They  went  and  were  favorably  received. 
Latinus  immediately  concluded  that  the  Trojan  hero  was  no 
other  than  the  promised  son  In-law  announced  by  the  oracle. 
He  cheerfully  granted  his  alliance,  and  sent  back  the  messengers 
mounted  on  steeds  from  his  stables,  and  loaded  with  gifts  and 
friendly  messages. 

Juno,  seeing  things  go  thus  prosperously  for  the  Trojans,  felt 
her  old  animosity  revive,  summoned  Alecto  from  Erebus,  anc 
sent  her  to  stir  up  discord.  The  Fury  first  took  possession  of 
the  queen,  Amata,  and  roused  her  to  oppose  in  every  way  the 
new  alliance. 

*'  Forthwith,  in  fell  Gorgonian  venom  steeped, 
Alecto  seeks  the  realms,  and  lays  her  siege 
Before  Amatas'  silent  chamber  door." 

— ^Virgil,  Book  vii.  (Cranch). 

Alecto  then  speeded  to  the  city  of  Turnus,  and,  assuming  the 
form  of  an  old  priestess,  informed  him  of  the  arrival  of  the  for 
eigners  and  of  the  attempt  of  their  prince  to  rob  him  of  his 
bride.  Next  she  turned  her  attention  to  the  camp  of  the  Tro- 
jans. There  she  saw  the  boy  lulus  and  his  companions  amusing 
themselves  with  hunting.  She  sharpened  the  scent  of  the  dogs, 
and  led  them  to  rouse  up  from  the  thicket  a  tame  stag,  the  fa 
vorite  of  Silvia,  the  daughter  of  Tyrrheus,  the  king's  herdsman. 
A  javelin  from  the  hand  of  lulus  wounded  the  animal,  and  he 
had  only  strength  left  to  run  homewards,  and  died  at  his  mis- 
tress's feet.  Her  cries  and  tears  roused  her  brothers  and  the 
herdsmen,  and  they,  seizing  whatever  weapons  came  to  hand, 
furiously  assaulted  the  hunting  party.  These  were  protected  by 
their  friends,  and  the  herdsmen  were  finally  driven  back  with 
the  loss  of  two  of  their  number. 

,  These  things  were  enough  to  rouse  the  storm  of  war,  and  the 
queen,  Turnus,  and  the  peasants,  all  urged  the  old  king  to  drive 
the  strangers  from  the  country. 

"  This  the  first  cause  of  troubles  proved,  and  lit 
The  flames  of  v/ar  within  the  peasants'  hearts." — ViRGiL  (Cranch). 

He  resisted  as  long  as  he  could,  but  finding  his  opposition  un- 
availing, finally  gave  way  and  retreated  to  his  retirement.

STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEBOES, 


Opening  the  Gates  of  Ja'nus. 

It  was  the  custom  of  the  country,  when  war  was  to  be  under- 
taken, for  the  chief  mag- 
istrate, clad  in  his  robes 
of  office,  with  solemn 
pomp  to  open  the  gates 
ofthetempleofja'nus, 
which  were  kept  shut  as 
long  as  peace  endured. 
His  people  now  urged 
the  old  king  to  perform 
that  solemn  office,  but 
he  refused  to  do  so. 
While  they  contested, 
Juno  herself,  descend- 
ing from  the  skies, 
smote  the  doors  with 
irresistible    force,    and 

burst  them  open. 
Janus. 

**  Then  the  queen  of  gods,  herself 
Descending  from  the  skies,  the  unwilling  gates 
Pushed  with  her  hand,  then  turned  the  hinges  back, 
And  open  burst  the  iron  gates  of  war." 

— Virgil,  Book  vii.  (Cranch). 

Immediately  the  whole  country  was  in  a  flame.     The  people 
rushed  from  every  side,  breathing  nothing  but  war. 

Turnus  was  recognized  by  all  as  leader  \  others  joined  as  allies, 
chief  of  whom  was  Mezentius,  a  brave  and  able  soldier,  but  of 
detestable  cruelty.  He  had  been  the  chief  of  one  of  the  neigh- 
boring cities,  but  his  people  drove  him  out.  With  him  was 
joined  his  son  Lausus,  a  generous  youth,  worthy  of  a  better  sire. 

Ca-mil'la. 

Ca-mil'la,  the  favorite  of  Diana,  a  huntress  and  warrior,  after 
the  fashion  of  the  Amazons,  came  with  her  band  of  mounted 
followers,  including  a  select  number  of  her  own  sex,  and  ranged 
herself  on  the  side  of  Turnus. 


EVANDER.  343 

•^  Last  comes  Camilla,  of  the  Volscian  race, 
Leading  a  band  of  riders  to  the  field." 

This  maiden  had  never  accustomed  her  fingers  to  the  distaff  of 
the  loom,  but  had  learned  to  endure  the  toils  of  war,  and  in 
speed  to  outstrip  the  wind.  It  seemed  as  if  she  might  run  over 
the  standing  corn  without  crushing  it,  or  over  the  surface  of  the 
water  without  dipping  her  feet.  Camilla's  history  had  been 
singular  from  the  beginning.  Her  father  Mctabus,  driven  from 
his  city  by  civil  discord,  carried  with  him  in  his  flight  his  infant 
daughter.  As  he  fled  through  the  woods,  his  enemies  in  hot 
pursuit,  he  reached  the  bank  of  the  river  Amazenus,  which, 
swelled  by  rains,  seemed  to  debar  a  passage.  He  paused  for  a 
moment,  then  decided  what  to  do.  He  tied  the  infant  to  his 
lance  with  wrappers  of  bark,  and,  poising  the  weapon  in  his  up- 
raised hand,  thus  addressed  Diana:  **  Goddess  of  the  woods,  I 
consecrate  this  maid  to  you;"  then  hurled  the  weapon,  with 
its  burden,  to  the  opposite  bank.  The  spear  flew  across  the 
roaring  water.  His  pursuers  were  already  upon  him,  but  he 
plunged  into  the  river  and  swam  across,  and  found  the  spear, 
with  the  infant,  safe  on  the  other  side.  Thenceforth  he  lived 
among  the  shepherds  and  brought  up  his  daughter  in  woodland 
arts.  While  a  child  she  was  taught  to  use  the  bow  and  throw  the 
javelin.  With  her  sling  she  could  bring  down  the  crane  or  the 
wild  swan.  Her  dress  was  a  tiger's  skin.  Many  mothers  sought 
her  for  a  daughter-in-law,  but  she  continued  faithful  to  Diana 
and  repelled  the  thought  of  marriage. 

E-van'der. 

Such  were  the  formidable  allies  that  ranged  themselves  against 
^neas.  It  was  night,  and  he  lay  stretched  in  sleep  on  the  bank 
of  the  river,  under  the  open  heavens, 

"  His  breast  disturbed  with  gloomy  thoughts  of  war." 

The  god  of  the  stream.  Father  Tiber,  seemed  to  raise  his  head 
above  the  willows  and  to  say,  **0  goddess-born,  destined  pos- 
sessor of  the  I^tin  realms,  this  is  the  promised  land,  here  is  to 
be  your  home,  here  shall  terminate  the  hostility  of  the  heavenly 
powers,  if  only  you  faithfully  persevere.     There  are  friends  not

far  distant.  Prepare  your  boats  and  row  up  my  stream ;  I  wil 
lead  you  to  E-van'der,  the  Arcadian  chief.  Pie  has  long  been 
at  strife  with  Turnus  and  the  Rutulians,  and  is  prepared  to  be- 
come an  ally  of  yours.  Rise  !  offer  your  vows  to  Juno,  and  de- 
precate her  anger.  When  you  have  achieved  your  victory,  then 
think  of  me. ' '  ^neas  woke  and  paid  immediate  obedience  to 
the  friendly  vision.  He  sacrificed  to  Juno,  and  invoked  the  god 
of  the  river  and  all  his  tributary  fountains  to  lend  their  aid. 
Then  for  the  first  time  a  vessel  filled  with  armed  warriors  floated 
on  the  stream  of  the  Tiber.  The  river  smoothed  its  waves,  and 
bade  its  current  flow  gently,  while,  impelled  by  the  vigorous 
strokes  of  the  rowers,  the  vessel  shot  rapidly  up  the  stream. 

About  the  middle  of  the  day  they  came  in  sight  of  the  scat- 
tered buildings  of  the  infant  town,  where  in  after  times  the  proud 
city  of  Rome  grew,  whose  glory  reached  the  skies. 

**  Then  swift 
They  turn  their  prows  and  near  the  city's  walls." 

By  chance  the  old  king,  Evander,  was  that  day  celebrating  an- 
nual solemnities  in  honor  of  Hercules  and  all  the  gods.  Pallas, 
his  son,  and  all  the  chiefs  of  the  little  commonwealth  stood  by. 
When  they  saw  the  tall  ship  gliding  onward  through  the  wood, 
they  were  alarmed  at  the  sight,  and  rose  from  the  tables.  But 
Pallas  forbade  the  solemnities  to  be  interrupted,  and  seizing  a 
weapon,  stepped  forward  to  the  river's  bank.  He  called  aloud, 
demanding  who  they  were,  and  what  their  object,  ^neas, 
holding  forth  an  olive-branch,  replied,  **  We  are  Trojans,  friends 
to  you  and  enemies  to  the  Rutulians.  We  seek  Evander,  and 
offer  to  join  our  arms  with  yours.**  Pallas,  in  amaze  at  the 
sound  of  so  great  a  name,  invited  them  to  land,  and  when  ^neas 
touched  the  shore  he  seized  his  hand,  and  held  it  long  in  friendly 
grasp.  Proceeding  through  the  wood  they  joined  the  king  and 
his  party,  and  were  most  favorably  received.  Seats  were  pro- 
vided for  them  at  the  tables,  and  the  repast  proceeded.

When  the  solemnities  were  ended  all  moved  towards  the  city 

*•  Burdened  with  old  age, 
The  king  moves  onward,  keeping  at  his  side 
iEneas  and  his  son." — Virgil,  Book  viii.  (Cranch). 


INFANT  ROME,  345 

/Eneas  with  delight  looked  and  listened,  observing  all  the  beau- 
ties of  the  scene,  and  learning  much  of  heroes  renowned  in  an- 
cient times.  Evander  said,  "These  extensive  groves  were  once 
inhabited  by  fauns  and  nymphs,  and  a  rude  race  of  men  who 
sprang  from  the  trees  themselves,  and  had  neither  laws  nor  social 
culture.  They  knew  not  how  to  yoke  the  cattle  nor  raise  a  har- 
vest, nor  provide  from  present  abundance  for  future  want,  but 
browsed  like  beasts  upon  the  leafy  boughs,  or  fed  voraciously 
on  their  hunted  prey.  Such  were  they  when  Saturn,  expelled 
from  Olympus  by  his  sons,  came  among  them  and  drew  together 
the  fierce  savages,  formed  them  into  society,  and  gave  them  laws. 
Such  peace  and  plenty  ensued  that  men  ever  since  have  called 
his  reign  the  golden  age ;  but  by  degrees  far  other  times  suc- 
ceeded, and  the  thirst  of  gold  and  the  thirst  of  blood  prevailed. 
The  land  was  a  prey  to  successive  tyrants,  till  fortune  and  resist- 
less destiny  brought  me  hither,  an  exile  from  my  native  land, 
Arcadia. ' ' 

Having  thus  said,  he  showed  him  the  Tarpeian  rock,  and  the 
rude  spot,  then  overgrown  with  bushes,  where  in  after  times  the 
Capitol  rose  in  all  its  magnificence.  He  next  pointed  to  some 
dismantled  walls,  and  said  : 

**  Yon  two  towns, 
With  ruined  walls,  thou  seest,  the  relics  old 
And  monuments  of  ancient  days.     This  one 
Was  reared  by  Janus,  that  by  Saturn  built^ 
Saturnia  and  Janiculum  their  names." — ViRGlL. 

Such  discourse  brought  them  to  the  cottage  of  poor  Evander, 
whence  they  saw  the  lowing  herds  roaming  over  the  plain 
where  now  the  proud  and  stately  Forum  stands.  They  entered, 
and  a  couch  was  spread  for  yEneas,  well  stuffed  with  leaves  and 
covered  with  the  skin  of  a  Libyan  bear. 

Next  morning,  awakened  by  the  dawn  and  the  shrill  song  of 
birds  beneath  the  eaves  of  his  low  mansion,  old  Evander  rose. 
Clad  in  a  tunic,  and  a  panther's  skin  thrown  over  his  shoulders, 
with  sandals  on  his  feet,  and  his  good  sword  girded  to  his  side, 
he  went  forth  to  seek  his  guest.  Two  mastiffs  followed  him, 
his  whole  retinue  and  body-guard.  He  found  the  hero  attended 
bv  his  faithful  Achates,  and,  Pallas  soon  joining  them,  the  old 
kmg  spoke  thus: 


346  STORIES  OF  QODS  AND  HEROES, 

**  Illustrious  Trojan,  it  is  but  little  .we  can  do  in  so  great  a 
cause.  Our  state  is  feeble,  hemmed  in  on  one  side  by  the  river, 
on  the  other  side  by  the  Rutulians.  But  I  propose  to  ally  you 
with  a  people  numerous  and  rich,  to  whom  fate  has  brought  you 
at  the  propitious  moment.  The  Etruscans  hold  the  country 
beyond  the  river.  Mezentius  was  their  king,  a  monster  of 
cruelty,  who  invented'  unheard-of  torments  to  gratify  his  veu' 
geance.  He  would  fasten  the  dead  to  the  living,  hand  to  hand 
and  face  to  face,  and  leave  the  wretched  victims  to  die  in  that 
dreadful  embrace.  At  length  the  people  cast  him  out,  him  and 
his  house.  They  burned  his  palace  and  slew  his  friends.  He 
escaped  and  took  refuge  with  Turnus,  who  protects  him  with 
arms.  The  Etruscans  demand  that  he  shall  be  given  up  to  de- 
served punishment,  and  would  ere  now  have  attempted  to  en- 
force their  demand ;  but  their  priests  restrain  them,  telling  them 
that  it  is  the  will  of  heaven  that  no  native  of  the  land  shall 
guide  them  to  victory,  and  that  their  destined  leader  must  come 
from  across  the  sea.  They  have  offered  the  crown  to  me,  but  I 
am  too  old  to  undertake  such  great  affairs,  and  my  son  is  native- 
born,  which  precludes  him  from  the  choice.  You,  equally  by 
birth  and  time  of  life,  and  fame  in  arms,  pointed  out  by  the 
gods,  have  but  to  appear  to  be  hailed  at  once  as  their  leader. 
With  you  I  will  join  Pallas,  my  son,  my  only  hope  and  com- 
fort. Under  you  he  shall  learn  the  art  of  war,  and  strive  to 
emulate  your  great  exploits." 

**  Pallas  himself  rode  in  the  midst, 
Conspicuous  with  his  scarf  and  shield  adorned 
With  painted  emblems.     Like  the  Morning  Star 
By  Venus  beloved  more  than  all  the  fires 
Of  heaven." — Virgil,  Book  viii.  (Cranch). 

Then  the  king  ordered  horses  to  be  furnished  for  the  Trojan 
chiefs,  and  ^neas,  with  a  chosen  band  of  followers  and  Pallas 
accompanying,  mounted  and  took  the  way  to  the  Etruscan  city,^ 
having  sent  back  the  rest  of  his  party  in  the  ships,     ^neas  and 

^  The  poet  here  inserts  a  famous  line  which  is  thought  to  imitate  in  its 
sound  the  galloping  of  horses.  Tt  may  be  thus  translated  :  "Then  struck  the 
aoofs  of  the  steeds  on  the  ground  with  a  four-footed  trampling." — See  .VrO' 
verbial  Expressions. 


mSUS  AND  EURTALUS.  347 

his  band  safely  arrived  at  the  Etruscan  camp,  and  were  received 
with  open  arms  by  Tarchon  and  his  countrymen. 

Ni'sus  and  Eu-ry'a-lus. 

In  the  meanwhile  Turnus  had  collected  his  bands  and  made 
all  necessary  preparations  for  the  war.  Juno  sent  Iris  to  him 
with  a  message  inciting  him  to  take  advantage  of  the  absence 
of  uEneas  and  surprise  the  Trojan  camp. 

**  Now  is  the  time  to  call 
For  chariots  and  for  steeds." — Virgil. 

Accordingly,  the  attempt  was  made,  but  the  Trojans  were 
found  on  their  guard,  and  having  received  strict  orders  from 
.^neas  not  to  fight  in  his  absence,  they  lay  still  in  their  intrench- 
ments,  and  resisted  all  the  efforts  of  the  Rutulians  to  draw  them 
into  the  field.  Night  coming  on,  the  army  of  Turnus,  in  high 
spirits  at  their  fancied  superiority,  feasted  and  enjoyed  them- 
selves, and  finally  stretched  themselves  on  the  field  and  slept 
secure. 

In  the  camp  of  the  Trojans  things  were  far  otherwise.  There 
all  was  watchfulness  and  anxiety,  and  impatience  for  ^neas's 
return.  Ni'sus  stood  guard  at  the  entrance  of  the  camp,  and 
Eu-ry'a-lus,  a  youth  distinguished  above  all  in  the  army  for 
graces  of  person  and  fine  qualities,  was  with  him.  These  two 
were  friends  and  brothers  in  arms. 

**  These  two  were  bound 
In  closest  ties  of  love,  and  side  by  side 
Had  rushed  together  to  the  battle-field." 

— Virgil  (Cranch). 

Nisus  said  to  his  friend,  *'  Do  you  perceive  what  confidence  and 
carelessness  the  enemy  display  ?  Their  lights  are  few  and  dim., 
and  the  men  seem  all  oppressed  with  wine  or  sleep.  You  know 
how  anxiously  our  chiefs  wish  to  send  to  ^neas,  and  to  get  in- 
telligence  from  him.  Now  I  am  strongly  moved  to  make  my 
way  through  the  enemy's  camp  and  to  go  in  search  of  our  chief. 
If  I  succeed,  the  glory  of  the  deed  will  be  reward  enough  for  me, 
and  if  they  judge  the  service  deserves  anything  more,  let  thenj 
pay  it  to  you." 

Euryaius,  all  on  fire  with  the  love  of  adventure,   replied, 


348  STORIES  OF  QODS  AND  HEROES, 

**  Would  you,  then,  Nisus,  refuse  to  share  your  enterprise  with 
me?  And  shall  I  let  you  go  into  such  danger  alone  ?  Not  so 
my  brave  father  brought  me  up,  nor  so  have  I  planned  for  my- 
self when  I  joined  the  standard  of  ^'Eneas,  and  resolved  to  hold 
my  life  cheap  in  comparison  with  honor."  Nisus  replied,  **I 
doubt  it  not,  my  friend ;  but  you  know  the  uncertain  event  of 
such  an  undertaking,  and  whatever  may  happen  to  me,  I  wish 
you  to  be  safe.  You  are  younger  than  I  and  have  more  of  life 
in  prospect.  Nor  can  I  be  the  cause  of  such  grief  to  your  mother, 
who  has  chosen  to  be  here  in  the  camp  with  you  rather  than  stay 
and  live  in  peace  with  the  other  matrons  in  Acestes'  city." 
Euryalus  replied,  "  Say  no  more.  In  vain  you  seek  arguments 
to  dissuade  me.  I  am  fixed  in  the  resolution  to  go  with  you. 
Let  us  lose  no  time."  They  called  the  guard,  and  committing 
the  watch  to  them,  sought  the  general's  tent.  They  found  the 
chief  officers  m  consultation,  deliberating  how  they  should  send 
notice  to  yEneas  of  their  situation.  The  offer  of  the  two  friends 
was  gladly  accepted,  themselves  loaded  with  praises  and  prom- 
ised  the  most  liberal  rewards  in  case  of  success.  lulus  especially 
addressed  Euryalus,  assuring  him  of  his  lasting  friendship.  Eu- 
ryalus replied,  **  I  have  but  one  boon  to  ask.  My  aged  mother 
is  with  me  in  the  camp.  For  me  she  left  the  Trojan  soil,  and 
would  not  stay  behind  with  the  other  matrons  at  the  city  of 
Acestes.  I  go  now  without  taking  leave  of  her.  I  could  not 
bear  her  tears,  nor  set  at  naught  her  entreaties. 

*•  I  have  a  mother  bom 
Of  Priam's  ancient  race,  who  came  with  me 
To  Italy.     Troy  could  not  hold  her  back. 
Nor  King  Acestes'  walls.     I  leave  her  now 
Without  one  farewell  kiss,  and  knowing  naught 
Of  this,  my  dangerous  venture." 

—Virgil,  Book  ix.  (CrancK). 

But  do  thou,  I  beseech  you,  comfort  her  in  her  distress.  Prom.- 
ise  me  that,  and  I  shall  go  more  boldly  into  whatever  dangers 
may  present  themselves."  lulus  and  the  other  chiefs  were 
moved  to  tears,  and  promised  to  do  all  his  request.  *'Your 
mother  shall  be  mine,"  said  lulus,  *'and  all  that  I  have  promised 
to  you  shall  be  made  good  to  her,  if  you  do  not  return  to  t» 
ceive  it," 


NISUS  AND  EURYALUS,  349 

The  two  friends  left  the  camp  and  phinged  at  once  into  the 
midst  of  the  enemy.  They  found  no  watch,  no  sentinels  posted, 
but  all  about  the  sleeping  soldiers  strewn  on  the  grass  and  among 
the  wagons.  The  laws  of  war  at  that  early  day  did  not  forbid  a 
brave  man  to  slay  a  sleeping  foe,  and  the  two  Trojans  slew,  as 
they  passed,  such  of  the  enemy  as  they  could  without  exciting 
ilarm. 

**  They  cross  the  trenches,  and  through  shades  of  night 
Toward  the  hostile  camps  pursue  their  way." — Virgil. 

In  one  tent  Euryalus  made  prize  of  a  helmet  brilliant  with 
gold  and  plumes.  They  had  passed  through  the  enemy's  ranks 
without  being  discovered,  but  now  suddenly  appeared  a  troop 
directly  in  front  of  them,  which,  under  Volscens,  their  leader, 
were  approaching  the  camp.  The  glittering  helmet  of  Euryalus 
caught  their  attention,  and  Volscens  hailed  the  two  and  de- 
manded who  and  whence  they  were.  They  made  no  answer, 
but  plunged  into  the  wood.  The  horsemen  scattered  in  all  direc- 
tions to  intercept  their  flight.  Nisus  had  eluded  pursuit  and  was 
out  of  danger,  but  Euryalus  being  missing,  he  turned  back  to 
seek  him.  He  again  entered  the  wood,  and  soon  came  within 
sound  of  voices.  Looking  through  the  thicket,  he  saw  the  whole 
band  surrounding  Euryalus  with  noisy  questions.  What  should 
he  do  ?  how  extricate  the  youth  ?  or  would  it  be  better  to  die 
with  him? 

Raising  his  eyes  to  the  moon,  which  now  shone  clear,  he  said, 
**  Goddess,  favor  my  effort  !"  and,  aiming  his  javelin  at  one  of 
the  leaders  of  the  troop,  struck  him  in  the  back  and  stretched 
him  on  the  plain  with  a  death-blow.  In  the  midst  of  their 
amazement  another  weapon  flew,  and  another  of  the  party  fell 
dead.  Volscens,  the  leader,  ignorant  whence  the  darts  came, 
rushed,  sword  in  hand,  upon  Euryalus.  *'You  shall  pay  the 
penalty  of  both,"  he  said,  and  would  have  plunged  the  sword 
into  his  bosom,  when  Nisus,  who  from  his  concealment  saw  the 
peril  of  his  friend,  rushed  forward,  exclaiming,  **  'Twas  I,  'twas 
I ;  turn  your  swords  against  me,  Rutulians  ;  I  did  it ;  he  only 
followed  me  as  a  friend."  While  he  spoke  the  sword  fell  and 
pierced  the  comely  bosom  of  Euryalus.  His  head  fell  over  on 
his  shoulder,  like  a  flower  cut    down  by  the  plough,      Nisus

rushed  upon  Volscens  and  plunged  his  sword  into  his  body,  and 
was  himself  slain  on  the  instant  by  numberless  blows. 

*  *  And  dying  dealt  a  death-blow  to  his  foe  ; 
Then  on  the  lifeless  body  of  his  friend 
He  throws  himself,  pierced  through  with  many  a  wound. 
And  there  at  last  in  placid  death  he  slept." — Virgil  (Cranch). 

Me-zen'ti-us. 

^neas,  with  his  Etrurian  allies,  arrived  on  the  scene  of  action 
m  time  to  rescue  his  beleaguered  camp  ;  and  now,  the  two  armies 
being  nearly  equal  in  strength,  the  war  began  in  good  earnest. 
We  cannot  find  space  for  all  the  details,  but  must  simply  record 
the  fate  of  the  principal  characters  whom  we  have  introduced  to 
our  readers.  The  tyrant  Me-zen'ti-us,  finding  himself  engaged 
against  his  revolted  subjects,  raged  like  a  wild  beast.  He  slew 
all  who  dared  to  withstand  him,  and  put  the  multitude  to  flight 
wherever  he  appeared.  At  last  he  encountered  ^neas,  and  the 
armies  stood  still  to  see  the  issue. 

**  Mezentius  stalks, 
Swelling  with  rage,  across  the  field, 
^neas,  in  the  long  battalion,  sees 
His  foe  and  goes  to  meet  him." — Virgil  (Cranch). 

Mezentius  threw  his  spear,  which,  striking  v^neas's  shield, 
glanced  off  and  hit  Author.  He  was  a  Grecian  by  birth,  who 
had  left  Argos,  his  native  city,  and  followed  Evander  into  Italy. 
The  poet  says  of  him  with  simple  pathos  which  has  made  the 
words  proverbial,  **  He  fell,  unhappy,  by  a  wound  intended  for 
another,  looked  up  to  the  skies,  and  dying  remembered  sweet 
Argos.  "^  ^>neas  now  in  turn  hurled  his  lance.  It  pierced  the 
shield  of  Mezentius,  and  wounded  him  in  the  thigh.  Lausus, 
his  son,  could  not  bear  the  sight,  but  rushed  forward  and  inter- 
posed himself,  while  the  followers  pressed  round  Mezentius  and 
bore  him  away.  ^>neas  held  his  sword  suspended  over  Lausus 
and  delayed  to  strike,  but  the  furious  youth  pressed  on,  and  he 
vas  compelled  to  deal  the  fatal  blow. 

**  The  sad  soul  left  its  mortal  frame. 
And  thro'  the  air  fled  to  the  realm  of  shades." — Virgil. 

'  Sec  Proverbial  Expression*. 


PALLAS,  CAMILLA,  TURNUS.  3  5 1 

^neas  bent  over  him  in  pity.  **  Hapless  youth,"  he  said, 
"what  can  I  do  for  you  worthy  of  your  praise?  Keep  those 
arms  in  which  you  glory,  and  fear  not  but  that  your  body  shall 
be  restored  to  your  friends,  and  have  due  funeral  honors."  So 
saying,  he  called  the  timid  followers  and  delivered  the  body  into 
their  hands. 

Mezentius  meanwhile  had  been  borne  to  the  river-side,  and 
washed  his  wound.  Soon  the  news  reached  him  of  Lausus's 
death,  and  rage  and  despair  supplied  the  place  of  strength.  He 
mounted  his  horse  and  dashed  into  the  thickest  of  the  fight, 
seeking  ^neas.  Having  found  him,  he  rode  round  him  in  a  cir- 
cle, throwing  one  javelin  after  another,  while  ^neas  stood 
fenced  with  his  shield,  turning  every  way  to  meet  them.  At  last, 
after  Mezentius  had  three  times  made  the  circuit,  ^neas  threw 
his  lance  directly  at  the  horse's  head.  It  pierced  his  temples  and 
he  fell,  while  a  shout  from  both  armies  rent  the  skies. 

•*  Where  is  the  fierce  Mezentius  now,  and  all 
The  wild  impetuous  force  that  filled  his  soul  ?" — Virgil. 

Mezentius  asked  no  mercy,  but  only  that  his  body  might  be 
spared  the  ^insults  of  his  revolted  subjects,  and  be  buried  in  the 
same  grave  with  his  son.  He  received  the  fatal  stroke  not  un- 
prepared, and  poured  out  his  life  and  his  blood  together. 

PaVlas,  Ca-mina,  Tur'nus. 

While  these  things  were  doing  in  one  part  of  the  field,  in  an- 
other  Tur'nus  encountered  the  youthful  Pal'las.  The  contest 
between  champions  so  unequally  matched  could  not  be  doubtful. 
Pallas  bore  himself  bravely,  but  fell  by  the  lance  of  Turnus.  The 
victor  almost  relented  when  he  saw  the  brave  youth  lying  dead 
at  his  feet,  and  spared  to  use  the  privilege  of  a  conqueror  in  de- 
spoiling him  of  his  arms.  The  belt  only,  adorned  with  studs 
and  carvings  of  gold,  he  took  and  clasped  round  his  own  body. 
The  rest  he  remitted  to  the  friends  of  the  slain. 

After  the  battle  there  was  a  cessation  of  arms  for  some  aays,  10 
allow  both  armies  to  bury  their  dead.  In  this  interval  ^neas 
challenged  Turnus  to  decide  the  contest  by  single  combat,  but 
Turnus  evaded  the  challenge.  Another  battle  ensued,  in  which 
Ca-miria,  the  virgin  warrior,  was  chiefly  conspicuous.     Hei

deeds  of  valor  surpassed  those  of  the  bravest  warriors,  and  many 
Trojans  and  Etruscans  fell  pierced  with  her  darts  or  struck  down 
by  her  battle-axe.  At  last  an  Etruscan  named  Aruns,  who  had 
watched  her  long,  seeking  for  some  advantage,  observed  hex

pursuing  a  flying  enemy  whose  splendid  armor  offered  a 
tempting  prize.  Intent  on  the  chase  she  observed  not  her  danv 
ger,  and  the  javelin  of  Aruns  struck  her  and  inflicted  a  fata^ 
wound.  She  fell,  and  breathed  her  last  in  the  arms  of  her  at- 
tendant maidens.

But  Diana,  who  beheld  her  fate,  suffered  not  her  slaughter  to  be

struck  by  a  secret  arrow,  launched  by  one  of  the  nymphs  of 
Diana's  train,  and  died  ignobly  and  unknown. 

At  length  the  final  conflict  took  place  between  ^neas  and 
»Tumus.  Turnus  had  avoided  the  contest  as  long  as  he  could, 
but  at  last,  impelled  by  the  ill-success  of  his  arms  and  by  the 
munnurs  of  his  followers,  he  braced  himself  to  the  conflict. 

"  The  trumpet  hoarse 
Rings  out  the  bloody  signal  for  the  war. 
Fired  with  martial  zeal, 
Turnus  himself  is  there." — Virgil  (Cranch).

Turnus,  on  the  other

having  been  expressly 
forbidden  by  Jupiter  to 
assist  him  any  longer. 
Turnus  threw  his  lance,

from  the  shield  of

Then  Turnus's  fortitude

the  cradle  of  Rome  itself. 

Rom'u-lus  and  Re'mus. 

Among  the  descendants  were  two  brothers,  Numitor  and 
Amulius.  Amulius  is  said  to  have  usurped  the  crown,  and  in 
prder  to  perpetuate  his  power  made  his  brother's  daughter, 
Rhea  Silvia,  a  vestal  virgin.  But  she  broke  her  vow  to  virginity 
and  became  by  Mars  the  mother  of  the  twins  Rom'u-lus  and 
Re'mus.  Rhea  was  buried  alive,  and  her  sons,  having  been 
placed  in  a  basket,  were  thrown  into  the  Tiber.  The  river  over- 
flowed its  banks  and  the  children  were  washed  ashore.  A  she- 
wolf  prowling  about  took  pity  upon  them,  carried  them  to  her 
den,  and  suckled  them  with  her  cubs.  Here  they  were  found  by 
a  herdsman,  who  took  them  home  and  brought  them  up  as  his 
own  sons.  Subsequently  they  learned  their  kingly  origin,  and 
avenged  themselves  upon  Numitor  by  driving  him  from  his 
throne.  Remus  was  slain,  and  Romulus  became  the  founder  of 
Rome.

Py-thag'o-ras. 

The  teachings  of  Anchises  to  JEnesiSy  respecting  the  nature 
of  the  human  soul,  were  in  conformity  with  the  doctrines  of  the 
Pythagoreans.  Py-thag'o-ras,  born  five  hundred  and  forty 
years  before  our  era,  was  a  native  of  the  island  of  Samos,  but 
passed  the  chief  portion  of  his  life  at  Crotona,  in  Italy.  He  is 
therefore  sometimes  called  **  the  Samian,"  and  sometimes  '*the 
philosopher  of  Crotona. ' '  When  young  he  travelled  extensively, 
and  it  is  said  visited  Egypt,  where  he  was  instructed  by  the 
priests  in  all  their  learning,  and  afterwards  journeyed  to  the 
East,  and  visited  the  Persian  and  Chaldean  Magi,  and  the  Brah- 
mins of  India. 

At  Crotona,  where  he  finally  established  himself,  his  extraor- 
dinary qualities  collected  round  him  a  great  number  of  disciples. 
The  inhabitants  were  notorious  for  luxury  and  licentiousness,  but 
the  good  effects  of  his  influence  were  soon  visible.  Sobriety  and 
temperance  succeeded.  Six  hundred  of  the  inhabitants  became 
his  disciples,  and  enrolled  themselves  in  a  society  to  aid  eacl 
other  in  the  pursuit  of  wisdom,  uniting  their  property  in  one 
common  stock,  for  the  benefit  of  the  whole.  They  were  re- 
quired to  practise  the  greatest  purity  and  simplicity  of  manners. 
The  first  lesson  they  learned  was  silence ;  for  a  time  they  were 
required  to  be  only  hearers.  He  (Pythagoras)  said  so.*  **  Ipse 
dixit**  was  to  be  held  by  them  as  sufficient,  without  any  proof. 

'  He  himself  said  it. 


PYTHAGORAS.  357 

•*Then  ask  me  not,  nor  seek  to  know 
Why  this  is  true,  or  that  is  so, 
For  truth  as  such  is  not  to  thee, 
Since  I  am  it,  and  it  is  me." — Klopp. 

It  was  only  the  advanced  pupils,  after  years  of  patient  submis* 
sion,  who  were  allowed  to  ask  questions  and  to  state  objections. 
One  of  his  greatest  contributions  to  humanity  was  the  inventiop 
of  the  lyre,  which  is  generally  ascribed  to  him. 

*'  As  great  Pythagoras  of  yore, 

Standing  beside  the  blacksmith's  door, 

And  hearing  the  hammers  as  they  smote 

The  anvils  with  a  different  note, 

Stole  from  the  varying  tones  that  hung 

Vibrant  on  every  iron  tongue, 

The  secret  of  the  somiding  wire, 

And  formed  the  seven-chorded  lyre." — LoNGFELLOW. 

Pythagoras  considered  nionbei's  as  the  essence  and  principle 
of  all  things,  and  attributed  to  them  a  real  and  distinct  exist- 
ence, so  that  in  his  view  they  were  the  elements  out  of  which 
the  universe  was  constructed.  How  he  conceived  this  process 
has  never  been  satisfactorily  explained.  He  traced  the  various 
forms  and  phenomena  of  the  world  to  numbers  as  their  basis  and 
essence.  The  monad,  or  unit,  he  regarded  as  the  source  of 
all  numbers.  The  number  Two  was  imperfect,  and  the  cause 
of  increase  and  division.  Tlwee  was  called  the  number  of  the 
whole,  because  it  had  a  beginning,  middle  and  end  ;  Four,  rep 
resenting  the  square,  is  in  the  highest  degree  perfect ;  and  Ten, 
as  it  contains  the  sum  of  the  four  prime  numbers,  comprehends 
all  musical  and  arithmetical  proportions,  and  denotes  the  system 
of  the  world. 

As  the  numbers  proceed  from  the  monad,  so  he  regarded  the 
pure  and  simple  essence  of  the  Deity  as  the  source  of  all  the 
forms  of  nature.  Gods,  demons  and  heroes  are  emanations  of 
the  Supreme ;  and  there  is  a  fourth  emanation,  the  human  soul. 
This  is  immortal,  and,  when  fi"eed  from  the  fetters  of  the  body, 
passes  to  the  habitation  ot  the  dead,  where  it  remains  till  it  re- 
turns to  the  world,  to  dwell  in  some  other  human  or  animal 
body,  and  at  last,  when  sufficiently  purified,  it  returns  to  tha 
source  from  which  it  proceeded.     This  doctrine  of  the  transmi* 


358  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 

gration  of  souls,  or  metempsychosis,  which  was  originally 
Egyptian,  and  connected  with  the  doctrine  of  reward  and  pun- 
ishment of  human  actions,  was  the  chief  cause  why  the  Pythag- 
oreans killed  no  animals.  Ovid  represents  Pythagoras  address- 
ing his  disciples  in  these  words  :  ' '  Souls  never  die,  but  always, 
on  quitting  one  abode,  pass  to  another.  I  myself  can  remember 
that  in  the  time  of  the  Trojan  war  I  was  Euphorbus,  the  son  of 
Panthus,  and  fell  by  the  spear  of  Menelaus.  Lately,  being  in 
the  temple  of  Juno  at  Argos,  I  recognized  my  shield  hung  up 
there  among  the  trophies.  All  things  change,  nothing  perishes. 
The  soul  passes  hither  and  thither,  occupying  now  this  body, 
now  that,  passing  from  the  body  of  a  beast  into  that  of  a  man, 
and  thence  to  a  beast's  again. 

**  Thou  almost  mak'st  me  waver  in  my  faith. 
To  hold  opinion  with  Pythagoras, 
That  souls  of  animals  infuse  themselves 
Into  the  trunks  of  men  ;  thy  currish  spirit 
Governed  a  wolf,  who,  hanged  for  human  slaughter. 
Infused  his  soul  in  thee ;  for  thy  desires 
Are  wolfish,  bloody,  starved  and  ravenous.'* 

^-Merchant  of  Venice. 

As  wax  is  stamped  with  certain  figures,  then  melted,  then  stamped 
anew  with  others,  yet  is  always  the  same  wax,  so  the  soul,  being 
always  the  same,  yet  wears  at  different  times  different  forms. 
Therefore,  if  the  love  of  kindred  is  not  extinct  in  your  bosoms, 
forbear,  I  entreat  you,  to  violate  the  life  of  those  who  may 
haply  be  your  own  relatives.** 

The  relation  of  the  notes  of  the  musical  scale  to  numbers, 
whereby  harmony  results  from  vibrations  in  equal  times,  and  dis- 
cord from  the  reverse,  led  Pythagoras  to  apply  the  word  *' har- 
mony "  to  the  visible  creation,  meaning  by  it  the  just  adaptatioo 
of  parts  to  each  other. 

**  Ring  out,  ye  crystal  spheres  1 
Once  bless  our  human  ears  ; 

(If  ye  have  power  to  charm  our  senses  so ;) 
And  let  your  silver  chime 
Move  in  melodious  time. 

And  let  the  base  of  Heaven's  deep  organ  blow ; 
And  with  your  ninefold  harmony 
Make  up  full  concert  with  the  m^ene  symphony." — MiLTON.

Syb'a-ris  and  Cro-to'na. 

Syb'a-ris,  a  neighboring  city  to  Cro-to'na,  was  as  cele- 
brated for  luxury  and  effeminacy  as  Crotona  for  the  reverse.  A 
war  arose  between  the  two  cities,  and  Sybaris  was  conquered  and 
destroyed.  Milo,  the  celebrated  athlete,  led  the  army  of  Cro- 
tona. Many  stories  are  told  of  Milo's  vast  strength,  such  as  his 
carrying  a  heifer  of  four  years  old  upon  his  shoulders,  and  after- 
wards eating  the  whole  of  it  in  a  single  day.  The  mode  of  his 
death  is  thus  related.  As  he  was  passing  through  a  forest  he  saw 
the  trunk  of  a  tree  which  had  been  partially  split  open  by  wood- 
cutters, and  attempted  to  rend  it  further,  but  the  wood  closed 
upon  his  hands  and  held  him  fast,  in  which  state  he  was  attacked 
and  devoured  by  wolves. 

E-gyp'tian  Mythology. 

E-gyp'tian  Mythology,  like  Egyptian  history,  is  largely 
speculative.  The  researches  are  too  recent  to  admit  of  definite 
conclusions.  Egypt,  unfortunately,  has  no  great  epic.  No  Homer, 
Virgil  nor  Ovid  ever  sang  her  gods  into  immortality.  Her  his- 
tory is  a  grave ;  her  literature  the  marks  of  a  hand  dead  and 
dust  for  a  nameless  age.  The  great  Sphinx,  with  his  stony  lips 
touched  by  the  finger  of  Silence,  was  but  a  fit  emblem  of  what 
the  ancient  Egyptians  thought  and  were.  But  the  secrets  were 
yet  to  be  revealed,  and  in  a  way  that  seems  almost  accidental. 

The  Ro-set'ta  Stone. 

During  the  conquest  of  Napoleon,  an  officer,  while  digging  an 
entrenchment  about  the  town  of  Rosetta,  found  a  stone  on  which 
was  an  inscription  in  three  languages — the  hieroglyphic,  demotic,* 
and  Greek.  The  Greek  was  a  translation  of  the  former  two. 
This  served  as  a  key  to  the  sealed  chambers  of  hieroglyphic 
literature  and  laid  bare  the  secrets  of  Egyptian  antiquity.  Such  is 
the  Ro-set'ta  Stone,  one  of  the  greatest  discoveries  of  the  nine- 
teenth century.^  Since  then  Egyptology  has  become  a  possible 
science.  The  monumental  inscriptions  are  read  with  compara- 
tive ease ;  the  tombs  of  the  Pharaohs  have  been  opened,  and  the

size  and  substance  according  to  the  fortune  of  the  deceased,  and

followed  the  ritual  until  it  came  to  judgment  in  the  hall  of  Two

a  crown  upon  his  head.  Before  Osiris  stood  forty -two  judges, 
each  summoned  from  a  different  city,  to  pronounce  sentence 
upon  some  particular  sin ;  there  also  stood  before  <"he  god  tb? 
human-headed  Amset,  the  ape-headed  Hapi,  the  jackal -headed 
Duamutef,  and  the  hawk-headed  Kebehsenuf.  These  had  charge 
of  the  viscera,  because  of  the  belief  that  it  was  not  the  soul  that 
sinned,  but  the  internal  organs.  The  deceased  was  received  by 
he  goddess  of  Truth.  He  then  proceeded  to  speak  in  his  own 
behalf  declaring  he  had  committed  none  of  the  forty-two  mor-

tal  sins.  The  denials  here  made  indicate  a  high  sense  of  moral- 
ity— **I  have  not  brought  any  to  hunger;"  '*  I  have  not  com- 
mitted wickedness;"  **I  have  not  taken  milk  from  the  mouths 
of  children  ;"  **  I  have  not  caused  any  to  weep  ;"  *'  I  have  not! 
added  to  the  weight  of  the  scales;"  **I  have  not  committed 
murder," 

The  truth  of  his  words  was  tested  by  weighing  his  heart  in  the 
scales  against  the  symbol  of  truth.  Horus  superintended  the 
weighing,  assisted  by  Aniibis  or  Thoth.  The  latter  acted  as 
scribe  of  the  gods,  and  recorded  the  proceedings.  If  the  dead 
was  found  to  be  righteous  he  received  back  his  heart  and  was  re- 
built into  a  man.     He  then  entered  the  boat  of  the  Sun,  and  was

giiided  by  good  spirits  to  the  home  of  the  blest.  From  other 
sources  it  would  seem  that  he  became  the  com])anion  of  Osiris 
for  three  thousand  years,  when  he  re-entered  his  old  body  and 
lived  on  earth  again.  This  process  was  continued  until  the  man 
was  absorbed  into  God.  As  to  the  disposition  of  the  wicked, 
the  same  uncertainty  seems  to  prevail ;  presumably  they  died  a 
second  death  and  ceased  to  be.  In  many  representations  the 
figure  of  a  female  hippopotamus  may  be  seen  in  the  judgment 
hall.  She  is  termed  the  **  devourer  of  the  under  world,"  and  is 
thought  to  be  present  for  the  purpose  of  destroying  those  who 
failed  to  pass  the  ordeal  of  judgment. 

Elsewhere  it  is  said  that  the  judges  of  the  dead  slay  the  wicked 
and  drink  their  blood.  This  was  a  point,  however,  on  which 
there  seems  to  have  been  no  uniformity  of  belief.^  The  Egyp- 
tian's idea  of  God  is  as  yet  but  imperfectly  understood.  Whether 
he  believed  in  the  one  Supreme  Deity  manifesting  Himself  in  a 
thousand  forms,  or  whether  each  form  was  a  distinct,  separate 
god,  remains  to  be  determined.  The  question  is  so  complex 
that  many  believe  there  were  three  orders  of  gods — one  for  the 
priests,  one  impersonating  human  powers,  and  one  embodying 
the  forms  and  forces  of  nature.  In  those  primitive  ages  men 
failed  to  think  of  spirit  independent  of  matter.  The  conse- 
quence was  a  belief  in  the  transmigration  of  souls,  and  animal 
worship  of  the  most  revolting  kind.  Almost  every  beast  and 
reptile  had  a  worshipper  somewhere  in  the  valley  of  the  Nile. 

Animals  were  held  sacred  because  they  were  thought  to  em- 
body some  deity,  or  manifest  certain  qualities  common  with  the 
gods. 

The  central  figure  in  this  particular*  form  of  worship  was  Apis, 
the  sacred  bull. 

A'pis. 

A' pis,  the  Bull  of  Memphis,  was  worshipped  with  the  great- 
est reverence  by  the  Egyptians.  He  was  supposed  to  be  the  in- 
carnation of  Osiris,  the  god  of  the  under  world.  The  individual 
animal  who  was  held  to  be  Apis  was  recognized  by  certain  signs. 
It  was  requisite  that  he  should  be  quite  black,  have  a  white 
square  mark  on  the  forehead,  another,  in  the  form  of  an  eagle,

on  his  back,  and  under  his  tongue  a  lump  somewhat  in  th«  shape 
of  a  scarabaius  or  beetle.  ^  As  soon  as  a  bull  thus  marked  was 
found  by  those  sent  in  search  of  him,  he  was  placed  in  a  building 
facing  the  east,  and  was  fed  with  milk  for  four  months.  At  the 
expiration  of  this  term  the  priests  repaired,  at  new  moon,  with 
great  pomp,  to  his  habitation  and  saluted  him  Apis.  He  was 
placed  in  a  vessel  magnificently  decorated  and  conveyed  down 
the  Nile  to  Memphis,  where  a  temple,  with  two  chapels  and  a

court  for  exercise,  was  assigned  to  him.  Sacrifices  were  made  to 
him,  and  once  every  year,  about  the  time  when  the  Nile  began 
to  rise,  a  golden  cup  was  thrown  into  the  river,  and  a  grand  fes- 
tival was  held  to  celebrate  his  birthday.  The  people  believed 
that  during  this  festival  the  crocodiles  forgot  their  natural  ferocity 
and  became  harmless.  There  was,  however,  one  drawback  to 
his  happy  lot ;  he  was  not  permitted  to  live  beyond  a  certain 
period  ;  and  if,  when  he  had  attained  the  age  of  twenty-five  years, 
he  still  survived,  the  priests  drowned  him  in  the  sacred  cistern, 
and  then  buried  him  in  the  temple  of  Serapis.  Several  of  these 
tombs  have  been  opened,  and  the  mummies  of  the  animals  found 
just  as  they  were  buried.     One  tomb  especially  was  in  such  per*

feet  condition  that  the  footprints  of  the  last  Egyptian  who  left 
the  chamber  at  the  interment  of  the  Apis,  three  thousand  years 
ago,  were  still  visible.^  On  the  death  of  this  bull,  whether  it  oc- 
curred in  the  course  of  nature  or  by  violence,  the  whole  land  was 
filled  with  sorrow  and  lamentations,  which  lasted  until  his  suc- 
cessor was  found. 

The  Apis  was  believed  to  have  been  begotten  by  a  deity,  de- 
Ecending  as  a  ray  of  moonlight  upon  the  cow  which  was  to  be 
the  mother  of  the  beast ;  hence  he  was  regarded  as  the  son  of  a 

god. 

E-gyp'tian  Gods. 

The  deities  were  divided  into  triads,  supreme  in  their  own  par- 
ticular locality.  Thus  Memphis,  Thebes,  Heliopolis  were  recog- 
nized as  god  centres  by  the  people. 

The  Egyptian  temples  were  always  dedicated  to  three  gods. 
The  first  is  the  male  principle,  the  second  the  female,  and  the 
third  the  offspring  of  the  other  two.  But  these  three  are  blended 
into  one.  The  father  engenders  himself,  and  thus  becomes  his 
own  father  and  his  own  son,  thereby  expressing  the  eternity  of  a 
Being  who  has  had  no  beginning  and  shall  have  no  end.* 

The  unification  of  the  empire  brought  with  it  the  unification 
of  the  various  circles  of  gods.  They  were  all  grouped  together 
under  the  sovereignty  of  Ptah  while  the  old  empire  lasted,  of 
Amun  when  Thebes  gained  the  supremacy.  The  Sun  may  be  re- 
garded as  the  centre  of  Egyptian  worship.  He  arose  as  Horus, 
became  Ra  at  noonday,  and  set  as  Tum.* 

The  principal  divinities  were  represented  as  follows : 

Phtah  or  Ptah  :  In  form  a  mummy,  holding  the  emblem  called 
by  some  the  Nilometer,  by  others  the. emblem  of  Stability,  called 
**  the  Father  of  the  Beginning,  the  Creator  of  the  Egg  of  the 
Sun  and  Moon,"  Chief  Deity  of  Memphis. 

K^iephy  Knoum  or  Knouphis :  Ram-headed,  called  the  Maker 
of  Gods  and  Men,  the  Soul  of  the  Gods.  Chief  Deity  of  Ele- 
phantine and  the  Cataracts.

earth   to   bestow    gifts  and   blessings  on   its    inhabitants.      Isis

showed  them  first  the  use  of  wheat  and  barley,  and  Osiris  made 
the  instruments  of  agriculture  and  taught  men  the  use  of  them, 
as  well  as  how  to  harness  the  ox  to  the  plough.  He  then  gave 
men  laws,  the  institution  of  marriage,  a  civil  organization,  and 
taught  them  how  to  worship  the  gods.  After  he  had  thus  made 
the  valley  of  the  Nile  a  happy  country,  he  assembled  a  host,  with 
which  he  went  to  bestow  his  blessings  upon  the  rest  of  the  world. 
He  conquered  the  nations  everywhere  only  with  music  and  eio 
quence.  His  brother  Typhon  saw  this,  and  sought  during  his 
absence  to  usurp  his  throne.  But  Isis,  who  held  the  reins  of 
government,  frustrated  his  plans.  Still  more  embittered,  he  now 
resolved  to  kill  his  brother.  Having  organized  a  conspiracy  of 
seventy-two  members,  he  went  with  them  to  the  feast  which 
was  celebrated  in  honor  of  the  king's  return.  He  then  caused  a 
box  or  chest  to  be  brought  in,  which  had  been  made  to  fit  exactly 
the  size  of  Osiris,  and  declared  that  he  would  give  that  chest  of 
precious  wood  to  whosoever  could  get  into  it.  The  rest  tried  in 
vain,  but  no  sooner  was  Osiris  in  it  than  Typhon  and  his  compan- 
ions closed  the  lid  and  flung  the  chest  into  the  Nile.  When  Isis 
heard  of  the  cruel  murder  she  wept  and  mourned  ;  and  then,  with 
her  hair  shorn,  clothed  in  black,  and  beating  her  breast,  she 
sought  diligently  for  the  body  of  her  husband.  In  this  search 
she  was  materially  assisted  by  Anubis,  the  son  of  Osiris  and 
Nephthys.  They  sought  in  vain  for  some  time  ;  for  when  the 
chest,  carried  by  the  waves  to  the  shores  of  Byblos,  had  be- 
come entangled  in  the  reeds  that  grew  at  the  edge  of  the 
water,  the  divine  power  that  dwelt  in  the  body  of  Osiris  im- 
parted such  strength  to  the  shrub  that  it  grew  into  a  mighty  tree, 
enclosing  in  its  trunk  the  coffin  of  the  god.  This  tree,  with  its 
sacred  deposit,  was  shortly  after  felled,  and  erected  as  a  column 
in  the  palace  of  the  king  of  Phoenicia.  But  at  length,  by  the 
aid  of  Anubis  and  the  sacred  birds,  Isis  ascertained  these  facts, 
and  then  went  t^>  the  royal  city.  There  she  offered  herself  at 
the  ualace  as  a  servant,  and,  being  admitted,  threw  off  her  dis- 
yjise  and  appeared  as  the  goddess,  surrounded  with  thunder  and 
lightning.  Striking  the  column  with  her  wand,  she  caused  it  to 
split  open  and  give  up  the  sacred  coffin.

Trampling  the  unshowered  grass  with  lowings  loud; 

Nor  can  he  be  at  rest

Nought  but  profoundest  hell  can  be  his  shroud. 

In  vain  w^ith  timbrel' d  anthems  dark 
The  sable-stoled  sorcerers  bear  his  worshipped  ark." 

— Milton. 

This  she  seized,  and  returned  with  it,  and  concealed  it  in  the 
depth  of  a  forest ;  but  Typhon  discovered  it,  and  cutting  the 
body  into  fourteen  pieces,  scattered  them  hither  and  thither. 
After  a  tedious  search,  Isis  found  thirteen  pieces,  the  fishes  of 
the  Nile  having  eaten  the  other.  This  she  replaced  by  an  imi- 
tation of  sycamore  wood,  and  buried  the  body  at  Philoe,  which 
became  ever  after  the  great  burying-place  of  the  nation,  and 
the  spot  to  which  pilgrimages  were  made  from  all  parts  of  the 
country.  A  temple  of  surpassing  magnificence  was  also  erected 
there  in  honor  of  the  god,  and  at  every  place  where  one  of 
his  limbs  had  been  found,  minor  temples  and  tombs  were  built 
to  commemorate  the  event.  Osiris  became,  after  that,  the  tutelar 
deity  of  the  Egyptians.  His  soul  was  supposed  always  to  in- 
habit the  body  of  the  bull  Apis,  and  at  his  death  to  transfer 
itself  to  his  successor. 

Oracles. 

Oracle  was  the  name  used  to  denote  the  place  where  answers 
were  supposed  to  be  given  by  any  of  the  divinities  to  those  who 
consulted  them  respecting  the  future.  The  word  was  also  used 
to  signify  the  response  which  was  given. 

Oracle  of  Ju'pi-ter  at  Do-do'na. 

The  most  ancient  Grecian  oracle  was  that  of  Ju'pi-ter  at  Do- 
do'na.  According  to  one  account  it  was  established  in  the  fol- 
lowing manner :  Two  black  doves  took  their  flight  from  Thebes 
in  Egypt.  One  flew  to  Dodona  in  Epirus,  and  alighting  in  a 
grove  of  oaks,  it  proclaimed  in  human  language  to  the  inhabit- 
ants of  the  district  that  they  must  establish  there  an  oracle  of 
Jupiter.  The  other  dove  flew  to  the  temple  of  Jupiter  Ammon 
in  the  Libyan  oasis,  and  delivered  a  similar  command  there.

**  And  I  will  work  in  prose  and  rhyme, 

And  praise  thee  more  in  both 
Than  bard  has  honored  beech  or  lime, 

Or  that  Thessalian  growth 
In  which  the  swarthy  ring-dove  sat 

And  mystic  sentence  spoke." — TeNNYSON. 

Another  account  is,  that  they  were  not  cloves,  but  priestesses, 
who  were  carried  off  from  Thebes  in  Egypt  by  the  Phoenicians, 
and  set  \ip  oracles  at  the  Oasis  and  Dodona.  The  responses  of 
the  oracle  were  given  from  the  trees,  by  the  branches  rustling  in 
the  wind,  the  sounds  being  interpreted  by  the  priests. 

Oracle  of  A-pol'lo  at  Del'phi. 

But  the  most  celebrated  of  the  Grecian  oracles  was  that  of 
A-pol'lo  at  Del'phi,  a  city  built  on  the  slopes  of  Parnassus  in 
Phocis,  and  the  supposed  centre  of  the  earth. 

*'  Now  to  this  land  of  Delphi  am  I  come, 
Where  seated  on  the  centre  of  the  world 
His  oracles  Apollo  to  mankind 
Discloses,  ever  chanting  both  events. 
Present  and  those  to  come." — Euripides  (Ion). 

It  had  been  observed  at  a  very  early  period  that  the  goats 
feeding  on  Parnassus  were  thrown  into  convulsions  when  they 
approached  a  certain  long  deep  cleft  in  the  side  of  the  mountain. 
This  was  owing  to  a  peculiar  vapor  arising  out  of  the  cavern, 
and  one  of  the  goat-herds  was  induced  to  try  its  effects  upon 
himself.  Inhaling  the  intoxicating  air,  he  was  affected  in  the 
same  manner  as  the  cattle  had  been,  and  the  inhabitants  of  the 
surrounding  country,  unable  to  explain  the  circumstance,  imputed 
the  convulsive  ravings  to  which  he  gave  utterance  while  under 
the  power  of  the  exhalations  to  a  divine  inspiration. 

*'  For  then  he  was  inspired,  and  from  him  came, 
As  from  the  Pythian' s  mystic  cave  of  yore. 
Those  oracles  which  set  the  world  in  flame, 

Nor  ceased  to  burn  till  kingdoms  were  no  more." 

Byron's  Rosseau. 

The  fact  was  speedily  circulated  M'idcly,  and  a  temple  was 
erected  on  the  spot.  "^Fhe  prophetic  influence  was  at  first  variously 
attributed  to  the  goddess  Earth,  to  Ne[)tune,  Themis,  and  others, 
but  it  was  at  length  assigned  to  Apollo,  and  lo  him  alone.     A 


ORACLE  OF  TROPIIONIUS.  373 

priestess  was  appointed  whose  office  it  was  to  inhale  the  hallowed 
air,  and  who  was  named  the  Pythia.  She  was  prepared  for  this 
duty  by  previous  ablution  at  the  fountain  of  Castalia,  and  being 
crowned  with  laurel  was  seated  uj)on  a  tripod  similarly  adorned, 
which  was  placed  over  the  chasm  whence  the  divine  afflatus  pro- 
ceeded. Her  inspired  words  while  thus  situated  were  interpreted 
by  the  priests. 

Oracle  of  Tro-pho'ni-us. 

Besides  the  oracles  of  Jupiter  and  Apollo,  at  Dodona  and  Del- 
phi, that  of  Tro-pho'ni-us  in  Boeotia  was  held  in  high  estima- 
tion. Trophonius  and  Agamedes  were  brothers.  They  were 
distinguished  architects,  and  built  the  Temple  of  Apollo  at  Del- 
phi, and  a  treasury  for  King  Hyrieus.  In  the  wall  of  the  treasury 
they  placed  a  stone  in  such  a  manner  that  it  could  be  taken  out, 
and  by  this  means  from  time  to  time  purloined  the  treasure. 
This  amazed  Hyrieus,  for  his  locks  and  seals  were  untouched, 
and  yet  his  wealth  continually  diminished.  At  length  he  set  a 
trap  for  the  thief,  and  Agamedes  was  caught.  Trophonius,  un- 
able to  extricate  him,  and  fearing  that  when  found  he  would  be 
compelled  by  torture  to  discover  his  accomplice,  cut  off  his  head. 
Trophonius  himself  is  said  to  have  been  shortly  afterwards  swal- 
lowed up  by  the  earth. 

The  oracle  of  Trophonius  was  at  Tebadea  in  Boeotia.  During 
a  great  drought  the  Boeotians,  it  is  said,  were  directed  by  the  god 
at  Delphi  to  seek  aid  of  Trophonius  at  Lebadea.  They  came 
thither,  but  could  find  no  oracle.  One  of  them,  however,  hap- 
pening to  see  a  swarm  of  bees,  followed  them  to  a  chasm  in  the 
earth,  which  proved  to  be  the  place  sought. 

Peculiar  ceremonies  were  to  be  performed  by  the  person  who 
came  to  consult  the  oracle.  After  these  preliminaries,  he 
descended  into  the  cave  by  a  narrow  passage.  This  place 
could  be  entered  only  in  the  night.  The  person  returned  from 
the  cave  by  the  same  narrow  passage,  but  walking  backwards. 
He  appeared  melancholy  and  dejected,  and  hence  the  proverb 
which  was  applied  to  a  person  low-spirited  and  gloomy,  *'He 
has  been  consulting  the  oracle  of  Trophonius. ' ' 

Oracle  of  ^s-cu-la'pi-us. 
There  were  numerous  oracles  of  .ffis-cu-la'pi-us,  but  the  most 


374  STORIES  OF  OODS  AND  HEROES 

celebrated  one  was  at  Epidaufus.  Here  the  sick  sought  responses 
and  the  recovery  of  their  health  by  sleeping  in  the  temple.  It 
has  been  inferred,  from  the  accounts  that  have  come  down  to  us, 
that  the  treatment  of  the  sick  resembled  what  is  now  called  Ani- 
mal Magnetism  or  Mesmerism. 

Serpents  were  sacred  to  ^sculapius,  probably  because  of  a 
superstition  that  those  animals  have  a  faculty  of  renewing  their 
youth  by  a  change  of  skin.  The  worship  of  yEsculapius  was  in- 
troduced into  Rome  in  a  time  of  great  sickness,  and  an  embassy 
sent  to  the  temple  of  Epidaurus  to  entreat  the  aid  of  the  god. 
-^sculapius  was  propitious,  and  on  the  return  of  the  ship  accom- 
panied it  in  the  form  of  a  serpent.  Arriving  in  the  river  Tiber, 
the  serpent  glided  from  the  vessel  and  took  possession  of  an 
island  in  the  river,  and  a  temple  was  there  erected  to  his  honor. 

Oracle  of  A'pis. 

At  Memphis  the  sacred  bull  A'pis  gave  answer  to  those  who 
consulted  him  by  the  manner  in  which  he  received  or  rejected 
what  was  presented  to  him.  If  the  bull  refused  food  from  the 
hand  of  the  inquirer  it  was  considered  an  unfavorable  sign,  and 
the  contrary  when  he  received  it. 

It  has  been  a  question  whether  oracular  responses  ought  to  be 
ascribed  to  mere  human  contrivance  or  to  the  agency  of  evil 
spirits.  The  latter  opinion  has  been  most  general  in  past  ages. 
A  third  theory  has  been  advanced,  since  the  phenomena  of  Mes- 
merism have  attracted  attention,  that  something  like  the  mes- 
meric trance  was  induced  in  the  Pythoness,  and  the  faculty  of 
clairvoyance  really  called  into  action. 

Another  question  is  as  to  the  time  when  the  Pagan  oracles 
ceased  to  give  responses.  Ancient  Christian  writers  assert  that 
they  became  silent  at  the  birth  of  Christ,  and  were  heard  no 
more  after  that  date. 

*  *  The  oracles  are  dumb  ; 
No  voice  or  hideous  hum 

Rings  through  the  arched  roof  in  words  deceiving. 
Apollo  from  his  shrine 
Can  no  more  divine, 

With  hollow  shriek  the  steep  of  Delphos  leaving. 
No  nightly  trance  or  breathed  spell 
Inspires  *V>e  pale-eyed  priest  from  the  prophetic  cell." — MiLTON.

Origin  of  Mythology. 

Having  reached  the  close  of  our  series  of  stories  of  Pagan 
mythology,  an  inquiry  suggests  itself.  **  Whence  came  these 
stories?  Have  they  a  foundation  in  truth,  or  are  they  simply 
dreams  of  the  imagination  ?' '  Philosophers  have  suggested  various 
theories  on  the  subject ;  and  i .  The  Scriptural  theory ;  accord- 
ing to  which  all  mythological  legends  are  derived  from  the  nar- 
ratives of  Scripture,  though  the  real  facts  have  been  disguised 
and  altered.  Thus  Deucalion  is  only  another  name  for  Noah, 
Hercules  for  Samson,  Arion  for  Jonah,  etc.  Sir  Walter  Raleigh, 
in  his  History  of  the  World,  says,  **  Jubal,  Tubal,  and  Tubal- 
Cain  were  IVIercury,  Vulcan,  and  Apollo,  inventors  of  Pasturage, 
Smithing,  and  INIusic.  The  Dragon  which  kept  the  golden  ap- 
ples was  the  serpent  that  beguiled  Eve.  Nimrod's  tower  was 
the  attempt  of  the  Giants  against  Heaven."  There  are  doubt- 
less many  curious  coincidences  like  these,  but  the  theory  cannot 
without  extravagance  be  pushed  so  far  as  to  account  for  any  great 
proportion  of  these  stories.

376  -STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES 

2.  The  Historical  theory  ;  according  to  which  all  the  persona 
mentioned  in  mythology  were  once  real  human  beings,  and  the 
legends  and  fabulous  traditions  relating  to  them  are  merely  the 
additions  and  embellishments  of  later  times.  Thus  the  story  of 
JEolus,  the  king  and  god  of  the  winds,  is  supposed  to  have  risen 
from  the  fact  that  ^olus  was  the  ruler  of  some  islands  in  the 
Tyrrhenian  Sea,  where  he  reigned  as  a  just  and  pious  king,  and 
laught  the  natives  the  use  of  sails  for  ships,  and  how  to  tell  fr-^n^ 
the  signs  of  the  atmosphere  the  changes  of  the  weather  and  the 
winds.  Cadmus,  who,  the  legend  says,  sewed  the  earth  with 
dragons'  teeth,  from  which  sprang  a  crop  of  armed  men,  was  in 
fact  an  emigrant  from  Phcenicia,  and  brought  with  him  into 
Greece  the  knowledge  of  the  letters  of  the  alphabet,  which  he 
taught  to  the  natives.  From  these  rudiments  of  learning  sprung 
civilization,  which  the  poets  have  always  been  prone  to  describe 
as  a  deterioration  of  man's  first  estate,  the  Golden  Age  of  inno- 
cence and  simplicity. 

3.  The  Allegorical  theory  supposes  that  all  the  myths  of  the 
ancients  were  allegorical  and  symbolical,  and  contained  some 
moral,  religious,  or  philosophical  truth  or  historical  fact,  under 
the  form  of  an  allegory,  but  came  in  process  of  time  to  be  un- 
derstood literally.  Thus  Saturn,  who  devours  his  own  children, 
is  the  same  power  whom  the  Greeks  called  Cronos  (Time), 
which  may  truly  be  said  to  destroy  whatever  it  has  brought  into 
existence.  The  story  of  lo  is  interpreted  ^n  a  similar  manner. 
lo  is  the  moon,  and  Argus  the  starry  sky,  which,  as  it  were, 
keeps  sleepless  watch  over  her.  The  fabulous  wanderings  of  lo 
represent  the  continual  revolutions  of  the  moon,  which  also  sug- 
gested to  Milton  the  same  idea. 

**  To  behold  the  wandering  moon 
Riding  near  her  highest  noon. 
Like  one  that  had  been  led  astray 
In  the  heaven's  wide,  pathless  way." — //  Penscroso, 

4.  The  Physical  theory ;  according  to  which  the  elements  of 
air,  fire  and  water  were  originally  the  objects  of  religious  adora- 
tion, and  the  j^rincipal  deities  were  personifications  of  the  powers 
of  nature.  The  transition  was  easy  from  a  personification  of  the 
elements  to  the  notion  of  supernatural  beui^s  presiding  over  and 


STATUES  OF  GODS  AND  GODDESSES.  ITJ 

governing  the  diderent  objects  of  nature.  The  Greeks,  whose 
imagination  was  lively,  peopled  all  nature  with  invisible  beings, 
and  supposed  that  every  object,  from  the  sun  and  sea  to  the 
smallest  fountain  and  rivulet,  was  under  the  care  of  some  par- 
ticular divinity.  Wordsworth,  in  his  Excursion,  has  beautifully 
developed  this  view  of  Grecian  mythology. 

*  *  The  Traveller  slaked 
His  thirst  from  rill  or  gushing  fount,  and  thanked 
The  Naiad.     Sunbeams  upon  distant  hills 
Gliding  apace  with  shadows  in  their  train, 
Might  with  small  help  from  fancy,  be  transformed 
Into  fleet  Oreads  sporting  visibly. 
The  Zephyrs,  fanning,  as  they  passed,  their  wings. 
Lacked  not  for  love  fair  objects  whom  they  wooed 
With  gentle  whisper.     Withered  boughs  grotesque, 
Stripped  of  their  leaves  and  twigs  by  hoary  age, 
From  depth  of  shaggy  covert  peeping  forth 
In  the  low  vale,  or  on  steep  mountain  side ; 
And  sometimes  intermixed  with  stirring  horns 
Of  the  live  deer,  or  goat's  depending  beard  ; 
These  were  the  lurking  Satyrs,  a  wild  brood 
Of  gamesome  deities  ;  or  Pan  himself. 
The  simple  shepherd's  awe-inspiring  god.'* 

5.  A  more  recent  theory  would  account  for  myths  through 
the  development  of  language.  Thus  Zeus  originally  meant  the 
sky.  In  the  process  of  time  the  primitive  significance  is  for- 
gotten, and  what  was  once  said  of  the  sky  is  applied  to  a  divine 
personality.     This  is  known  as  the  Philological  theory. 

All  the  theories  which  have  been  mentioned  are  true  to  a  cer- 
tain extent.  It  would  therefore  be  more  correct  to  say  that  the 
mythology  of  a  nation  has  sprung  from  all  these  sources  com- 
bined than  from  any  one  in  particular. 

Statues  of  Gods  and  Goddesses. 

To  adequately  represent  to  the  eye  the  ideas  intended  to  be 
conveyed  to  the  mind  under  the  several  names  of  deities  was  a 
task  which  called  into  exercise  the  highest  powers  of  genius  and 
art.  Of  the  many  attempts  seven  have  been  most  celebrated, 
the  first  two  known  to  us  only  by  the  descriptions  of  the  ancients, 
the  others  still  extant  and  the  acknowledged  masterpieces  of  the 
•culptor's  art. 


378        STORIES  OF  OODS  AND  HEROES 

The  O-lym'pi-an  Ju'pi-ter. 

The  statue  of  the  Olympian  Jupiter  by  Phidias  was  con- 
sidered  the  highest  achievement  of  this  department  of  Grecian 
art.  It  was  of  colossal  dimensions,  and  was  what  the  ancients 
called  *'  chryselephantine ;"  that  is,  composed  of  ivory  and  gold  ; 
the  parts  representing  flesh  being  of  ivory  laid  on  a  core  of  wood 
DT  stone,  while  the  drapery  and  other  ornaments  were  of  gold. 
The  height  of  the  figure  was  forty  feet,  on  a  pedestal  twelve  feet 
high.  The  god  was  represented  seated  on  his  throne.  His 
brov/s  were  crowned  with  a  wreath  of  olive,  and  he  held  in  his 
right  hand  a  sceptre,  and  in  his  left  a  statue  of  Victory. 

"  All  around 
The  sovereign's  everlasting  head  his  curls 
Ambrosial  shook,  and  the  huge  mountain  reeled."— COWPER. 

The   throne   was  of  cedar,  adorned   with   gold  and   precious 
stones. 

The  idea  which  the  artist  essayed  to  embody  was  that  of  the 
supreme  deity  of  the  Hellenic  or  Grecian  nation,  enthroned  as  a 
conqueror,  in  perfect  majesty  and  repose,  and  ruling  with  a  nod 
the  subject  world.  Phidias  avowed  that  he  took  his  idea  from 
the  representation  which  Homer  gives  in  the  first  book  of  the 
Iliad,  in  the  passage  thus  translated  by  Pope : 

•*  He  spoke  and  awful  bends  his  sable  brows, 
Shakes  his  ambrosial  curls  and  gives  the  nod, 
The  stamp  of  fate  and  sanction  of  the  god. 
High  heaven  with  reverence  the  dread  signal  took, 
And  all  Olympus  to  the  centre  shook." 

The  Mi-ner'va  of  the  Par'the-non. 
This  was  also  the  work  of  Phidias.  It  stood  in  the  Parthenon, 
or  temple  of  Minerva,  at  Athens.  The  goddess  was  represented 
standing.  In  one  hand  she  held  a  spear,  in  the  other  a  statue 
of  Victory.  Her  helmet,  highly  decorated,  was  surmounted  by 
a  Sphinx.  The  statue  was  forty  feet  in  height,  and,  like  the 
Jupiter,  composed  of  ivory  and  gold.  The  eyes  were  of  marble, 
and  probably  painted  to  represent  the  iris  and  pupil.  The  Par- 
thenon, in  which  this  statue  stood,  was  also  constructed  under 
4he  direction  and  superintendence  of  Phidias.     Its  exterior  was

enricned  with  sculptures,  many  of  them  from  the  hand  of  Phidias. 
The  Elgin  marbles,  now  in  the  British  Museum,  are  a  part  of 
them. 

Both  the  Jupiter  and  Minerva  of  Phidias  are  lost,  but  there  is 
good  ground  to  believe  that  we  have,  in  several  extant  statues 
and  busts,  the  artist's  conception  of  the  countenances  of  both. 
They  are  characterized  by  grave  and  dignified  beauty,  and  free- 
dom from  any  transient  expression,  which  in  the  language  of  art 
is  called  repose. 

The  Ve'nus  de*  Medici. 

The  Venus  of  the  Medici  is  so  called  from  its  having  been  in 
the  possession  of  the  princes  of  that  name 
in  Rome  when  it  first  attracted  atten- 
tion, about  two  hundred  years  ago.  An 
inscription  on  the  base  records  it  to  be 
the  work  of  Cleomenes,  an  Athenian 
sculptor,  of  twenty -two  hundred  years 
ago,  but  the  authenticity  of  the  inscrip- 
tion is  doubtful.  There  is  a  story  that 
the  artist  was  employed  by  public  au- 
thority to  make  a  statue  exhibiting  the 
perfection  of  female  beauty,  and  to  aid 
him  in  his  task,  the  most  perfect  forms 
the  city  could  supply  were  furnished 
him  for  models.  It  is  this  which  Thom- 
son alludes  to  in  his  Summer  : 

' '  So  stands  the  statue  that  enchants  the  world ; 
So  bending  tries  to  veil  the  matchless  boast. 
The  mingled  beauties  of  exulting  Greece." 

Ve'nus  de  Milo. 

This  is  perhaps  the  most  famous  statue 
in  the  world.  It  was  found  by  a  peas- 
ant on  the  island  of  Melos  in  the  year 

1820.     Not  knowing  its  value,  he  sold  ,r  ,     ,,.,     ,^

their  restoration,  but  without  satisfactorv  results. 


380  STORIES  OF  OODS  AND  HEROES, 

The  A-pol'lo  Bel've-dere'. 

The  most  highly  esteemed  of  all  the  remains  of  ancient  sculp, 
lure  is  the  statue  of  Apollo,  called  the  Belvedere,  from  the  name 
of  the  apartment  of  the  Pope's  palace  at  Rome  in  which  it  is 
placed.  The  artist  is  unknown.  It  is  supposed  to  be  a  work 
of  Roman  art  of  about  the  first  century  of  our  era.  It  is  a  stand- 
ing figure,  in  marble,  more  than  seven  feet  high,  naked  except 
for  the  cloak  which  is  fastened  around  the  neck  and  hangs  ovei 
the  extended  left  arm.  It  is  supposed  to  represent  the  god  in 
the  moment  when  he  has  shot  the  arrow  to  destroy  the  monster 
Python.  (See  Chapter  III. )  The  victorious  divinity  is  in  the  act 
of  stepping  forward.  The  left  arm,  which  seems  to  have  held  the 
bow,  is  outstretched,  and  the  head  is  turned  in  the  same  direc- 
tion. In  attitude  and  proportion  the  graceful  majesty  of  the 
figure  is  unsurpassed.  The  effect  is  completed  by  the  counte- 
nance, where,  on  the  perfection  of  youthful  godlike  beauty  there 
dwells  the  consciousness  of  triumphant  power. 

The  Di-a'na  a  la  Biche. 

The  Diana  of  the  Hind,  in  the  palace  of  the  Louvre,  may  be 
considered  the  counterpart  to  the  Apollo  Belvedere.  The  atti- 
tude much  resembles  that  of  the  Apollo  ;  the  sizes  correspond, 
and  also  the  style  of  execution.  It  is  a  work  of  the  highest 
order,  though  by  no  means  equal  to  the  Apollo.  The  attitude 
is  that  of  hurried  and  eager  motion,  the  face  that  of  a  huntress 
in  the  excitement  of  the  chase.  The  left  hand  is  extended  over 
the  forehead  of  the  Hind,  which  runs  by  her  side  ;  the  right  arm 
reaches  backward  over  the  shoulder  to  draw  an  arrow  from  the 
quiver. 

Her'mes  of  O-lym'pia. 

This  statue  was  discovered  by  the  German  Olympian  explora 
tion  party  in  1879.  The  god  is  represented  as  leaning  with  his 
his  left  arm  upon  a  rock,  and  supporting  upon  it  the  infant 
Bacchus.  It  is  supposed  to  be  the  work  of  Praxiteles.  The 
right  arm  and  legs  below  the  knees  were  wanting,  but  these  have 
been  restored.

THE  POETS  OF  MYTIIOLOG K  ^8 1 

taken  the  chief  part  of  our  chapters  of  the  Trojan  war  and  the  re- 
turn of  the  Grecians,  is  ahiiost  as  mythical  a  personage  as  the 
heroes  he  celebrates.  The  traditionary  story  is  that  he  was  a 
wandering  minstrel,  blind  and  old,  who  travelled  from  place  to 
place  singing  his  lays  to  the  music  of  his  harp,  in  the  courts  of 
princes  or  the  cottages  of  peasants,  and  dependent  upon  the  vol- 
untary offerings  of  his  hearers  for  support.  Byron  calls  him 
'the  blind  old  man  of  Scio's  rocky  isle,"  and  a  well-known 
epigram,  alluding  to  the  uncertainty  of  the  fact  of  his  birth- 
place, says : 

**  Seven  wealthy  towns  contend  for  Homer  dead, 
Through  which  the  living  Homer  begged  his  bread.*' 

These  seven  were  Smyrna,  Scio,  Rhodes,  Colophon,  Salamis, 
Argos,  and  Athens. 

Modern  scholars  have  doubted  whether  the  Homeric  poems 
are  the  work  of  any  single  mind.  This  arises  from  the  difficulty 
of  believing  that  poems  of  such  length  could  have  been  com- 
mitted to  writing  at  so  early  an  age  as  that  usually  assigned  to 
these,  an  age  earlier  than  the  date  of  any  remaining  inscriptions 
or  coins,  and  when  no  materials  capable  of  containing  such  long 
productions  were  yet  introduced  into  use.  On  the  other  hand, 
it  is  asked  how  poems  of  such  length  could  have  been  handed 
down  from  age  to  age  by  means  of  the  memory  alone.  This  is 
answered  by  the  statement  that  there  was  a  professional  body  of 
men,  called  Rhapsodists,  who  recited  the  poems  of  others,  and 
whose  business  it  was  to  commit  to  memory  and  rehearse  for  pay 
the  national  and  patriotic  legends. 

The  prevailing  opinion  of  the  learned,  at  this  time,  seems  to 
be  that  the  framework  and  much  of  the  structure  of  the  poems 
belongs  to  Homer,  but  that  there  are  numerous  interpolations 
md  additions  by  other  hands. 

The  date  assigned  to  Homer,  on  the  authority  of  Herodotus, 
is  eight  hundred  and  fifty  years  before  our  era. 

Vir'gil. 

Vir'gil,  called  also  by  his  surname  Maro,  from  whose  poem 
of  the  ^neid  we  have  taken  the  story  of  ^neas,  was  one  of  the 
great  poets  who  made  the  reign  of  the  Roman  emperor,  Augus-

class  of  poetical  composition,  the  Epic.  Virgil  is  far  inferior  to

**  Ages  elapsed  ere  Homer's  lamp  appeared, 
And  ages  ere  the  Mantuan  swan  was  heard. 
To  carry  nature  lengths  unknown  before, 
To  give  a  Milton  birth,  asked  ages  more." — CowPER. 

His  poem  of  Paradise  Lost,  from  which  we  have  borrowed  so 
many  illustrations,  is  in  many  respects  equal,  in  some  superior,  to 
either  of  the  great  works  of  antiquity.

To  make  a  third  she  joined  the  other  two." — Dryden. 

Ov'id, 

Often  alluded  to  in  poetry  by  his  other  name  of  Naso,  was 
born  in  the  year  forty-three  before  Christ.  He  was  educated  for 
public  life,  and  held  some  offices  of  considerable  dignity ;  but 
poetry  was  his  delight,  and  he  early  resolved  to  devote  himself 
to  it.  He  accordingly  sought  the  society  of  the  contemporary 
poets,  and  was  acquainted  with  Horace  and  saw  Virgil,  though 
Ihe  latter  died  when  Ov'id  was  yet  too  young  and  undistinguished 
to  have  formed  his  acquaintance.  Ovid  spent  an  easy  life  at 
Rome  in  the  enjoyment  of  a  competent  income.  He  was  inti-- 
mate  with  the  family  of  Augustus,  the  emperor,  and  it  is  sup- 
posed that  some  serious  offence  given  to  some  member  of  that 
family  was  the  cause  of  an  event  which  reversed  the  poet's  happy 
circumstances  and  clouded  all  the  latter  portion  of  his  life.  At 
the  age  of  fifty  he  was  banished  from  Rome,  and  ordered  to  be- 
take himself  to  Tomi,  on  the  borders  of  the  Black  Sea.  Here, 
among  the  barbarous  people  and  in  a  severe  climate,  the  poet 
spent  the  last  ten  years  of  his  life.  His  only  consolation  in 
exile  was  to  address  his  wife  and  absent  friends,  and  his  letters 
were  all  poetical.  Though  these  poems  (the  Tristia  and  Let- 
ters from  Pontus)  have  no  other  topic  than  the  poet's  sorrows, 
his  exquisite  taste  have  redeemed  them  from  being  tedious,  so 
they  are  read  with  pleasure,  and  even  with  sympathy. 


384  STORIES  OF  OODS  AND  HEROES. 

The  two  great  works  of  Ovid  are  his  Metamorphoses  ani  his 
Fasti.  They  are  both  mythological  poems,  and  from  the  former 
we  have  taken  most  of  our  stories  of  Grecian  and  Roman  my- 
thology.    A  late  writer  thus  characterizes  these  poems : — 

"  The  rich  mythology  of  Greece  furnished  Ovid,  as  it  may 
still  furnish  the  poet,  the  painter,  and  the  sculptor,  with  mate- 
rials for  his  art.  With  exquisite  taste,  simplicity  and  pathos  he 
has  narrated  the  fabulous  traditions  of  early  ages,  and  given  to 
them  that  appearance  of  reality  which  only  a  master-hand  could 
impart.  The  Metamorphoses  are  read  with  pleasure  by  youth, 
and  are  re-read  in  more  advanced  age  with  still  greater  delight. 
The  poet  ventured  to  predict  that  his  poem  would  survive  him, 
and  be  read  wherever  the  Roman  name  was  known." 

The  prediction  above  alluded  to  is  contained  in  the  closing 
lines  of  the  Metam.orphoses : 

•*  And  now  I  close  my  work,  which  not  the  ire 
Of  Jove,  nor  tooth  of  time,  nor  sword,  nor  fire 
Shall  bring  to  nought.     Come  when  it  will  that  day 
Which  o'  er  the  body,  not  the  mind,  has  sway. 
And  snatch  the  remnant  of  my  life  away. 
My  better  part  above  the  stars  shall  soar, 
And  my  renown  endure  forevermore. 
Where'er  the  Roman  arms  and  arts  shall  spread, 
There  by  the  people  shall  my  book  be  read  ; 
And,  if  aught  true  in  poet's  visions  be, 
My  name  and  fame  have  immortality." 

.ffis'chy-lus. 

.ffis'chy-lus  was  born  five  hundred  and  twenty-five  years 
before  our  era,  and  died  at  sixty-nine  years  of  age.  He  is  said 
to  have  \i^ritten  seventy  dramas,  but  seven  of  which  have  come 
down  to  us  entire.  He  was  a  soldier  as  well  as  a  poet.  His 
life  was  in  itself  more  tragic,  if  possible,  than  anything  he  ever, 
wrote.  He  is  said  to  have  died  from  a  most  peculiar  circum- 
stance. An  eagle  flew  above  him  with  a  tortoise  in  his  claws, 
and,  mistaking  the  poet's  bald  head  for  a  stone,  dropped  the 
reptile  upon  it,  crushing  his  skull.  The  story,  however,  is  not 
generally  believed. 

Soph'o-cles. 
Soph'o-cles  was  born  about  five  hundred  years  before  the 


EVRIPIDES.  '     385 

Christian  era.  He  lived  in  the  same  age  with  -^schykis  and 
Euripides.  His  written  tragedies  numbered  one  hundred  and 
thirteen,  of  which  but  seven  are  extant.  He  was  a  soldier, 
philosopher,  and  poet ;  a  man  of  great  personal  beauty ;  the 
embodiment  of  the  Athenian  ideal  of  a  perfect  manhood.  Al- 
though he  lived  to  be  ninety-one  years  of  age,  his  mind  suffered 
no  decline.  Authorities  differ  as  to  the  cau.se  of  his  death.  By 
some  it  is  said  he  became  exhausted  from  publicly  reading 
Antigone,  and  by  others  he  died  from  excessive  joy  over  a 
dramatic  victory. 

Eu-rip'i-des. 

Eu-rip'i-des  was  born  about  four  hundred  and  eighty  years 
before  Christ.  He  wrote  some  say  seventy-five  and  others 
ninety-two  pieces,  all  but  nineteen  of  which  have  perished. 
When  about  seventy  years  of  age  he  removed  to  Macedon  by 
invitation  of  the  king,  where,  after  a  three  years'  residence,  he 
died.  Some  ascribe  the  cause  to  an  accident,  but  the  generally 
accepted  tradition  is  that  he  was  torn  to  pieces  by  the  royal 
hounds.  When  the  intelligence  of  his  death  reached  Athens, 
Sophocles  put  on  mourning,  and  ordered  the  actors  to  lay  aside 
their  crowns  on  the  stage.  These  are  known  as  the  * '  Three 
great  Attic  poc^^s.'

Modern  Monsters. 

There  is  a  set  of  imaginary  beings  which  seem  to  have  been 
the  successors  of  the  '  *  Gorgons,  Hydras,  and  Chimseras  dire  ' ' 
of  the  old  superstitions,  and,  having  no  connection  with  the 
false  gods  of  Paganism,  to  have  continued  to  enjoy  an  exist- 
ence in  the  popular  belief  after  Paganism  was  superseded  by 
Christianity.  They  are  mentioned,  perhaps,  by  the  classical 
writers,  but  their  chfef  popularity  and  currency  seem  to  have 
been  in  more  modern  times. 

The  Phoe'nix. 

Ovid  tells  the  story  of  the  Phcenix  as  follows  :  '*  Most  beings 
spring  from  other  individuals ;  but  there  is  a  certain  kind  which 
reproduces  itself.  The  Assyrians  call  it  the  Phoenix.  It  does 
not  live  on  fruit  or  flowers,  but  on  frankincense  and  odoriferous 
gums.  When  it  has  lived  five  hundred  years,  it  builds  itself  a 
nest  in  the  branches  of  an  oak,  or  on  the  top  of  a  palm  tree. 
In  this  it  collects  cinnamon,  and  spikenard,  and  myrrh,  and  of 
these  materials  builds  a  pile  on  which  it  deposits  itself,  and, 
dying,  breathes  out  its  last  breath  amidst  odors.  From  the 
body  of  the  parent  bird  a  young  Phoenix  issues  forth,  destined 
to  live  as  long  a  life  as  its  predecessor.  When  this  has  grown, 
it  lifts  its  nest  from  the  tree  (its  own  cradle  and  its  parent's  sep- 
ulchre), and  carries  it  to  the  city  of  Heliopolis,  in  Egypt,  and 
deposits  it  in  the  temple  of  the  Sun.'* 

*•  That  sole  bird 
When,  to  enshrine  his  relics  in  the  sun's 
Bright  temple,  to  Egyptian  Thebes  he  flies." — Mil  TOi.^. 

Such  is  the  account  given  by  a  poet.     Now  let  us  see  that  of  a 


THE  COCKATRICE  OR  BASILISK.  387 

philosophic  historian.  Tacitus  says:  ''In  the  consulship  of 
Paulus  Fabius,  just  before  our  era,  the  miraculous  bira  known 
by  the  name  of  the  Phoenix,  after  disappearing  for  a  series  of 
ages,  revisited  Egypt.  It  was  attended  in  its  flight  by  a  group 
of  various  birds,  all  attracted  by  the  novelty,  and  gazing  with 
wonder  at  so  beautiful  an  appearance." 

♦*  So  when  the  new-born  Phoenix  first  is  seen 
Her  feathered  subjects  all  adore  their  queen. 
And  while  she  makes  her  progress  through  the  East, 
From  every  grove  her  numerous  train  '  s  increased ; 
Each  poet  of  the  air  her  glory  sings, 
And  round  him  the  pleased  audience  clap  their  wings." 

— Dryden. 

He  then  gives  an  account  of  the  bird,  not  varying  materially 
from  the  preceding,  but  adding  some  details.  ''The  first  care 
of  the  young  bird  as  soon  as  able  to  trust  to  his  wings  is,  to  per- 
form the  obsequies  of  his  father.  He  collects  a  quantity  of 
myrrh,  and  makes  frequent  excursions  with  a  load  on  his  back. 
When  he  has  gained  sufficient  confidence  in  his  own  vigor,  he 
takes  up  the  body  of  his  father  and  flies  with  it  to  the  altar  of 
the  Sun,  where  he  leaves  it  to  be  consumed  in  flames  of  fra- 
grance. ' '  Other  writers  say  :  The  myrrh  is  compacted  in  the 
form  of  an  egg,  in  which  the  dead  Phoenix  is  enclosed.  From 
the  mouldering  flesh  a  worm  springs,  and  when  grown  large,  is 
transformed  into  a  bird.  Herodotus  describes  the  bird,  though 
he  says,  "  I  have  not  seen  it  myself,  except  in  a  picture.  Part 
of  his  plumage  is  gold-colored  and  part  crimson,  and  he  is  for 
the  most  part  very  much  like  an  eagle  in  outline  and  bulk. ' ' 

The  first  writer  who  disclaimed  a  belief  in  the  existence  of  the 
Phoenix  was  Sir  Thomas  Browne,  a  writer  of  two  hundred  and 
fifty  years  ago. 

The  Cock'a-trice,  or  Bas'i-lisk. 

This  animal  was  called  the  king  of  the  jerpents.  In  confirma- 
tion of  his  royalty  he  was  said  to  be  endowed  with  a  crest,  or 
comb  upon  the  head,  constituting  a  crown.  He  was  supposed 
to  be  produced  from  the  egg  of  a  cock  hatched  under  toads  or 
serpents.      There  were   several   species  of  this  animal.      One 

Species  burned  up  whatever  they  approached ;  a  second  were  a

kind  of  wandering  Medusa's  heads,  and  their  look  caused  an  in* 
stant  horror  which  was  immediately  followed  by  death.  In 
Shakspeare's  play  of  Richard  the  Third,  Lady  Anne,  in  answer 
to  Richard's  compliment  on  her  eyes,  says,  **  Would  they  were 
basilisks' ,  to  strike  thee  dead  ! ' ' 

The  basilisks  were  called  kings  of  serpents  because  all  other 
serpents  and  snakes  fled  the  moment  they  heard  the  distant  hiss 
of  their  king. 

The  Roman  naturalist  Pliny  thus  describes  him:   **  He  does 

not  impel  his  body,  like  other  serpents,  by  a  multiplied  flexion, 

but  advances  lofty  and  upright.     He  kills  the  shrubs,  not  only 

by  contact  but  by  breathing  on  them,  and  splits  the  rocks,  such 

power  of  evil  is  there  in  him."     It  was  formerly  believed  that 

if  killed  by  a  spear  from  on  horseback  the  power  of  the  poison 

conducted  through  the  weapon  killed  not  only  the  rider  but  the 

horse  also. 

*  •  \Vhat  though  the  Moor  the  basilisk  hath  slain. 
And  pinned  him  lifeless  to  the  sandy  plain. 
Up  through  the  spear  the  subtle  venom  flies, 
The  hand  imbibes  it,  and  the  victor  dies." — LUCAN. 

These  wonderful  powers  of  the  basilisk  are  attested  by  a  host 
of  learned  persons,  such  as  Galen,  Avicenna,  Scaliger,  and 
others.  Occasionally  one  would  demur  to  some  part  of  the  tale, 
while  he  admitted  the  rest.  Jonston,  a  learned  physician,  sagely 
remarks,  **  I  would  scarcely  believe  that  it  kills  with  its  look,  for 
who  could  have  seen  it  and  lived  to  tell  the  story?"  The  wor- 
thy sage  was  not  aware  that  those  who  went  to  hunt  the  basilisk 
of  this  sort  took  with  them  a  mirror,  which  reflected  back  the 
deadly  glare  upon  its  author,  and  by  a  kind  of  poetical  justice 
slew  the  basilisk  with  his  own  weapon. 

There  is  an  old  saying  that  **  every  thing  has  its  enemy,"  and 
the  cockatrice  quailed  before  the  weasel.  When  bitten,  the 
weasel  retired  for  a  moment  to  eat  some  rue,  which  was  the  only 
plant  the  basilisk  could  not  wither,  returned  with  renewed 
strength  and  soundness  to  the  charge,  and  never  left  the  enemy 
till  he  was  stretched  dead  on  the  plain.  The  monster,  too,  as  if 
consc'ous  of  the  irregular  way  in  which  he  came  into  the  world, 
was  supposed  to  have  a  great  antipathy  to  a  cock,  and  well  hfl 
might,  for  as  soon  as  he  heard  the  cock  crow  he  expired. 


THE  UNICORN.  389 

The  basilisk  was  of  some  use  after  death.  Thus  we  read  thaC 
its  carcass  was  suspended  in  the  temple  of  Apollo  and  in  private 
houses,  as  a  sovereign  remedy  against  spiders,  and  that  it  was 
also  hung  up  in  the  temple  of  Diana,  for  which  reason  no  swal- 
low ever  dared  enter  the  sacred  place. 

The  U'ni-corn. 

Pliny,  the  Roman  naturalist,  out  of  whose  account  of  the 
U'ni-corn  most  of  the  modern  unicorns  have  been  described 
and  figured,  records  it  as  **a  very  ferocious  beast,  similar  in  the 
Test  of  its  body  to  a  horse,  with  the  head  of  a  deer,  the  feet  of 
an  elephant,  the  tail  of  a  boar,  a  deep  bellowing  voice,  and  a 
single  black  horn,  two  cubits  in  length,  standing  out  in  the 
middle  of  its  forehead."  He  adds  that  **it  cannot  be  taken 
alive ;"  and  some  such  excuse  may  have  been  necessary  in  those 
days  for  not  producing  the  living  animal  upon  the  arena  of  the 
amphitheatre. 

The  unicorn  seems  to  have  been  a  sad  puzzle  to  the  hunters, 
who  hardly  knew  how  to  come  at  so  valuable  a  piece  of  game. 
Some  described  the  horn  as  movable  at  the  will  of  the  animal, 
a  kind  of  small  sword,  in  short,  with  which  no  hunter  who  was 
not  exceedingly  cunning  in  fence  could  have  a  chance.  Others 
maintained  that  all  the  animal's  strength  lay  in  its  horn,  and 
that  when  hard  pressed  in  pursuit  it  would  throw  itself  from  the 
pinnacle  of  the  highest  rocks  horn  foremost,  so  as  to  pitch  upon 
it,  and  then  quietly  march  off,  not  a  whit  the  worse  for  its  fall. 

But  they  found  out  how  to  circumvent  the  unicorn  at  last. 
They  discovered  that  it  was  a  great  lover  of  purity  and  inno- 
cence, so  they  took  the  field  with  a  young  virgin,  who  was  placed 
in  the  unsuspecting  admirer's  way.  When  the  unicorn  spied  her, 
he  approached  with  all  reverence,  crouched  beside  her,  and  lay- 
ing his  head  in  her  lap,  fell  asleep.  The  treacherous  virgin  theu' 
gave  a  signal,  and  the  hunters  made  in  and  captured  the  simple 
beast. 

Modern  zoologists  disbelieve  the  existence  of  the  unicorn. 
Yet  there  are  animals  bearing  on  their  heads  a  bony  protuber- 
ance more  or  less  like  a  horn,  which  may  have  given  rise  to  the 
story. 


390  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 

The  Sara-man'der. 

The  following  is  from  the  Life  of  Benvenuto  Cellini,  an  Italian 
artist  of  the  sixteenth  century,  written  by  himself:  "When  1 
was  about  five  years  of  age,  my  father,  happening  to  be  in  a 
little  room  in  which  they  had  been  washing,  and  where  there 
was  a  good  fire  of  oak  burning,  looked  into  the  flames  and  saw  a 
little  animal  resembling  a  lizard,  which  could  live  in  the  hottest 
part  of  that  element.  Instantly  perceiving  what  it  was,  he  called 
for  my  sister  and  me,  and  after  he  had  shown  us  the  creature, 
he  gave  me  a  box  on  the  ear.  I  fell  a  crying,  while  he,  sooth- 
ing me  with  caresses,  spoke  these  words :  *  My  dear  child,  I  do 
not  give  you  that  blow  for  any  fault  you  have  committed,  but 
that  you  may  recollect  that  the  little  creature  you  see  in  the  fire 
is  a  salamander — such  a  one  as  never  was  beheld  before  to  my 
knowledge.*  So  saying,  he  embraced  me,  and  gave  me  some 
money.** 

It  seems  unreasonable  to  doubt  a  story  of  which  Signor  Cel- 
lini was  both  an  eye  and  ear  witness.  Add  to  which  the  author- 
ity of  numerous  sage  philosophers,  at  the  head  of  whom  are 
Aristotle  and  Pliny,  affirms  this  power  of  the  salamander.  Ac- 
cording to  them,  the  animal  not  only  resists  fire,  but  extinguishes 
it,  and  when  he  sees  the  flame  charges  it  as  an  enemy  which  he 
well  knows  how  to  vanquish. 

The  foundation  of  the  above  fables  is  supposed  to  be  the  fact 
that  the  salamander  really  does  secrete  from  the  pores  of  his  body 
a  milky  juice,  which  when  he  is  irritated  is  produced  in  consid- 
erable quantity,  and  would  doubtless,  for  a  few  moments,  defend 
the  body  from  fire.  Then  it  is  a  hibernating  animal,  and  in 
winter  retires  to  some  hollow  tree  or  other  cavity,  where  it  coils 
itself  up  and  remains  in  a  torpid  state  till  the  spring  again  calls 
it  forth.  It  may  therefore  sometimes  be  carried  with  the  fuel 
to  the  fire,  and  wake  up  only  time  enough  to  put  forth  all  \tM 
faculties  for  its  defence.

Zo-ro-as'ter. 

The  religion  of  the  ancient  Persians  was  founded  by  Zo-ro- 
as'ter,  a  philosopher  of  whom  we  know  but  little.  He  is  said 
to  have  laughed  on  the  very  day  of  his  birth,  and  when  but  a  boy 
retired  to  the  wilderness,  where  for  thirty  years  he  lived  in  soli- 
tude. His  age  is  uncertain.  Plato  speaks  of  him  four  hundred 
years  before  Christ,  and  scholars  in  general  locate  him  from  one 
to  two  thousand  years  before  our  era.  Our  knowledge  of  what 
he  taught  is  principally  derived  from  the  Zend-Avesta,  or  sacred 
books  of  the  Persians. 

Zend  means  comment  and  Avesta  text,  so  the  compound  word 
implies  the  book  itself  and  its  commentary.  It  is  composed 
largely  of  Gathas  or  hymns,  of  which  the  following  extract,  said 
to  have  been  composed  by  Zoroaster  himself,  is  an  illustration ; 

*'  Hear  with  your  ears  what  is  Ijest,  perceive  with  your  minds  what  is  purest. 
So  that  each  man  for  himself  may,  before  the  great  doom  cometh, 
Choose  the  creed  he  prefers  ;  may  the  wise  one  be  on  our  side. 

*'  These  two  spirits  are  twins ;  they  made  known  in  times  that  are  bygone 
That  which  is  good  and  evil  in  thought  and  word  and  action, 
Rightly  decide  between  them  the  good  ;  not  so  the  evil. 

•*  When  these  Two  came  together,  first  of  all  they  created 
Life  and  death,  that  at  last  there  might  be  for  such  as  are  evil 
Wretchedness,  but  for  the  good  a  blest  existence." 

The  dualistic  idea  as  suggested  in  this  poem  runs  through  the 
entire  Zoroastrian  system.    He  taught  the  existence  of  a  Supreme

Being,  who  created  two  other  mighty  beings,  and  imparted  to 
them  as  much  of  his  own  nature  as  seemed  good  to  him.  Of 
these,  Ormuzd  remained  faitliful  to  his  creator,  and  was  regarded 
as  the  source  of  all  good,  while  Ahriman  rebelled,  and  became 
the  author  of  all  evil  upon  the  earth.  Ormuzd  created  man  and 
supplied  him  with  all  the  materials  of  happiness ;  but  Ahriman 
marred  this  happiness  by  introducing  evil  into  the  world,  and 
treating  savage  beasts  and  poisonous  reptiles  and  plants,     in 


Mithras  (Vatican,  Rome). 

consequence  of  this,  evil  and  good  are  now  mingled  together  in 
every  part  of  the  world,  and  the  followers  of  good  and  evil — the 
adherents  of  Ormuzd  and  Ahriman — carry  on  incessant  war.  But 
this  state  of  things  will  not  last  forever.  The  time  will  come 
when  the  adherents  of  Ormuzd  shall  everywhere  be  victorious, 
and  Ahriman  and  his  followers  be  consigned  to  darkness  forever. 
Mithra  was  a  sun -god,  resembling  somewhat  in  appearance 
and  nature  the  Grecian  Apollo.  His  worship  drifted  eastward, 
and  under  the  name  of  Mithras  entered  Germany  at  the  time  of 
the  Roman  invasion.     He  is  seen  as  a  young  man  clad  in  Asiatic

garments  and  wearing  a  Phrygian  cap.  The  services  of  Mithras 
were  held  in  caves  and  attended  by  secret  rites.  Christianity 
found  him  the  most  stubborn  of  all  the  pagan  deities. 

The  religious  rites  of  the  ancient  Persians  were  exceedingly 
simple.  They  used  neither  temples,  altars  nor  statues,  and  per- 
formed their  sacrifices  on  the  tops  of  mountains. 

**  A  fit  and  unwalled  temple,  there  to  seek 
The  Spirit,  in  whose  honor  shrines  are  weak, 
Upreared  of  human  hands." — Byron. 

They  adored  fire,  light  and  the  sun  as  emblems  of  Ormuzd,  the 
source  of  all  light  and  purity,  but  did  not  regard  them  as  in- 
dependent deities.

And  roofs  of  temples  built  by  human  hands, —

The  religious  rites  and  ceremonies  were  regulated  by  the  priests, 
who  were  called  Magi.  The  learning  of  the  Magi  was  connected 
with  astrology  and  enchantment,  in  which  they  were  so  cele- 
brated that  their  name  was  applied  to  all  orders  of  magicians 
and  enchanters. 

The  only  emblem  of  the  Supreme  Being  was  a  winged  circle 
combined  with  a  human  figure  wearing  a  robe  and  a  tiara.  The 
sacred  fires  were  kept  constantly  burning,  and  to  extinguish  them 
was  death.  Horses  were  offered  at  sacrifice.  Agriculture  was  a 
religious  duty  and  veracity  a  cardinal  virtue.  The  youth  were 
taught  three  things :  to  ride,  to  draw  the  bow,  and  to  speak  the 
truth.*  At  death  the  good  and  bad  alike  crowded  along  the 
same  way  to  the  *'  bridge  of  the  Gatherer."  The  good  were  as- 
sisted across  by  the  angel  Serosh.  On  the  other  side  they  were 
met  by  another  angel,  who  greeted  them  with  these  words  i 
**  How  happy  art  thou  to  exchange  mortality  for  immortality.*' 
The  wicked  fell  from  the  bridge  into  the  abyss  and  were  lost.'

The  religion  of  Zoroaster  was  the  dominant  religion  of  West- 
ern Asia  from  the  time  of  Cyrus,  five  hundred  and  fifty  years 
before  Christ,  to  the  conquest  of  Persia  by  Alexander  the  Great. 
Under  the  Macedonian  monarchy  the  doctrines  of  Zoroaster  ap- 
pear to  have  been  considerably  corrupted  by  the  introduction  of 
foreign  opinions,  but  they  afterwards  recovered  their  ascendancy. 
It  continued  to  flourish  even  after  the  introduction  of  Chris-i 
tianity,  and  in  the  third  century  was  the  dominant  faith  of  the 
East,  till  the  rise  of  the  Mahometan  power  and  the  conquest  of 
Persia  by  the  Arabs  in  the  seventh  century,  who  compelled  the 
greater  number  of  the  Persians  to  renounce  their  ancient  faith. 
Those  who  refused  to  abandon  the  religion  of  their  ancestors 
fled  to  the  deserts  of  Kerman  and  to  Hindustan,  where  they  still 
exist  under  the  name  of  Parsees,  a  name  derived  from  Pars, 
the  ancient  name  of  Persia.  The  Arabs  call  them  Guebers,  from 
an  Arabic  word  signifying  unbelievers. 

**  Yes  !   I  am  of  that  impious  race, 

Those  slaves  of  Fire,  that  morn  and  even 

Hail  their  creator's  dwelling-place 
Among  the  living  lights  of  heaven  ; 

Yes  !  I  am  of  that  outcast  crew 

To  Iran  and  to  vengeance  true. 

Who  curse  the  hour  your  Arabs  came 

To  desecrate  our  shrines  of  flame, 

And  swear  before  God's  burning  eye 

To  break  our  country's  chains  or  die." — MooRE. 

At  Bombay  the  Parsees  are  at  this  day  a  very  active,  intelligent, 
and  wealthy  class.  For  purity  of  life,  honesty  and  conciliatory 
manners,  they  are  favorably  distinguished.  They  have  numer- 
ous temples  to  Fire,  which  they  adore  as  the  symbol   of  the 

divinity. 

Bab-y-lo'ni-a. 

Bab-y-lo^ni-a  is  a  general  name  by  which  we  include  both 
Assyria  and  Nineveh.  Each  of  those  provinces  had  gods  peculiar 
to  herself,  but  the  distinction  is  too  slight  to  justify  recognitioi 
in  a  work  like  this.  Our  interest  in  Babylonian  mythology 
centres  largely  in  the  fact  that  once  it  came  in  contact  with  the 
monotheism  of  our  civilization.  This  was  the  scene  of  Israel'^ 
captivity,  one  of  the  most  far-reaching  events  in  all  history. 


BABYLONIA.  395 

"By  Babel's  streams  we  sat  and  wept, 
When  Zion  we  thought  on, 
In  midst  thereof  we  hanged"  our  harps 
The  willow  trees  upon." — Psalms. 

The  chief  deity  in  Babylon  was  IL,  or  Ra.  He  is  never  rep- 
resented by  an  image,  but  seems  to  have  permeated  the  national 
worship. 

The  god  of  Assyria  was  Asshur.  He  was  represented  as  a 
man  with  a  horned  cap,  often  carrying  a  bow,  issuing  from  a 
winged  circle.  The  circle  implies  eternity,  the  human  form 
intelligence,  and  the  horned  cap  power.*  The  succession  to 
these  gods  in  each  country  was  the  triad,  Anu,  Bel  and  Hoa. 
They  are  supposed  to  represent  Chaos,  Life,  and  Order,  or  pos- 
sibly the  gods  of  the  Earth,  Air,  and  Water.  The  god  Bel  is 
mentioned  in  Scripture,' and  is  the  most  conspicuous  in  Assyrian 
mythology.  He  is  the  Creator  of  the  earth,  and  made  man  by 
mixing  his  own  blood  with  the  ground.  He  also  created  the 
skies  and  planets.  In  the  "  war  of  the  gods ' '  he  fought  with  Tia- 
mat,  the  great  dragon,  and  flung  a  thunderbolt  into  her  mouth.' 

Then  follows  a  second  triad.  Sin,  Shamas  and  Vul,  the  gods 
of  the  Moon,  Sun,  and  Atmosphere.  These  divinities,  with  the 
exception  of  IL  and  Asshur,  had  their  corresponding  goddesses. 
Bilat,  the  wife  of  Bel,  was  the  mother  of  the  gods,  while  Ninazu, 
the  wife  of  Hoa,  was  Queen  of  Hades.  In  addition  to  these, 
there  were  five  deities  who  corresponded  to  the  five  planets, 
Saturn,  Jupiter,  Mars,  Venus,  and  Mercury.  Nin  was  a  fierce 
Assyrian  god,  who  received  his  inspiration  from  Saturn.  His 
emblem  was  a  winged  bull  with  a  human  head.  Merodach  was 
his  counterpart  in  Babylonia ;  the  temple  Bel  was  sacred  to  his 
worship.  Nergel  was  the  god  of  war,  and  is  represented  by  the 
human-headed  winged  lion,  so  common  in  Assyrian  art. 

The  Babylonians  never  descended  to  animal  worship ;  these 
two  instances  afford  the  only  exception  where  any  form  but 
the  human  entered  into  the  representation  of  a  god.  Their 
legends  were  most  peculiar.  They  believed  that  before  the  crea- 
tion seven  spirits  rebelled  in  heaven,  the  dwelling-place  of  Anu, 
the  king.  They  were  finally  repulsed  by  the  Sun,  Moon,  and  god 
Vul.     Subsequently  the  hosts  of  heaven,  to  the  number  of  five

thousand,  were  singing  a  psalm  of  praise  when  a  portion  of  the 
choir  rebelled  again.  Their  leader  took  the  form  of  a  dragon, 
who,  with  the  entire  rebellious  host,  were  cast  out  and  forbidden 
to  return.  In  their  stead  man  was  created.  In  the  beginning 
all  was  chaos  and  darkness.  Monsters  of  every  form  moved 
through  the  darkness — men  with  wings,  double  faces,  hoofs, 
horns  and  claws ;  dogs  with  four  bodies  and  fishes'  tails ;  horses 


with  human  heads,  and  reptiles  of  every  conceivable  form — all 
existing  in  a  wild,  chaotic  mass.  A  woman  by  the  name  of 
Omorka  ruled  them  all.  Belus  appeared  and  cleft  the  woman  in 
twam.  With  the  one  half  he  made  the  heavens  and  with  the 
other  half  the  earth.  He  also  cleft  the  darkness  and  put  the 
world  in  order.  The  last  creative  stage  was  to  order  a  god  to 
cut  off  his  head  and  mix  the  blood  with  earth.  This  was  done, 
and  man  was  the  result. 

The  people  believed  in  a  future  life  and  in  a  system  of  rewards 
and  punishments,  although  these  do  not  seem  to  have  been 
prominent  in  their  minds. 


FHCENICIAN  DEITIES. 


397 


Recent  explorations,  especially  about  the  sites  of  Nineveh  and 
Nipur,  have  given  the  world  a  fresh  interest  in  Babylonian  his- 
tory. Vases,  tablets  and  cylinders  are  constantly  being  found 
whose  inscriptions  speak  of  an  age  that  touches  the  very  dawn 
of  human  records.  The  ancients  bound  their  books  in  stone. 
Thus  the  earliest  editions  of  the  past  become  the  latest  of  the 
present.

Phoe-ni'cian    Deities. 

The  deities  of  Phoenicia  were  few,  and  at  their  head  stood 
Baal  and  Astarte.  Baal  was  the 
sun-god  and  Astarte  was  his  god- 
dess. Astarte  had  as  her  especial 
seat  the  city  of  Sidon.  She  rep- 
resented the  moon,  and  bore  the 
head  of  a  heifer  with  crescent 
horns.  One  of  her  titles  was 
**  Queen  of  Heaven,"  a  name  by 
which  she  was  known  to  Israel.^ 

Dagon  was  the  fish-god.  His 
form  was  that  of  a  man  and  fish 
combined.  He  was  probably  the 
same  deity  that  fell  before  the 
Ark  of  the  Covenant  when  it  was 
carried  into  captivity.^  Tammuz 
personified  the  decline  and  re- 
vival of  Nature.  When  the  rains 
fell  the  rivers  were  reddened  with 
his  blood.  In  times  of  drouth 
the  women  *'  wept  for  Tammuz. "' 
Moloch,  the  fiery  god,  indicates 
the  practice  of  offering  children 
as  sacrifices.  This  was  common.  Furnaces  were  constructed  in

The  whole  system  was  one  of  licentious

Hin'du  Mythology. 

The  religion  of  the  Hindus  is  profess* 
edly  founded  on  the  Vedas,  a  term  mean- 
ing *  *  knowledge. ' '  These  form  the  Hindu 
Scriptures,  and  consist  of  four  separate  col- 
lections, of  which  the  Rig-Veda  is  the  largest 
and  best  known.  The  Hindus  claim  they 
were  composed  by  Brahma  himself  at  the

era. 

Tne  Vedas  undoubtedly  teach  the  belief  of  one  supreme  God. 

**  In  the  beginning  there  arose  the  source  of  golden  light. 
He  was  the  only  born — Lord  of  all  that  is, 
Whose  shadow  is  immortality,  whose  shadow  is  death. 
He  measures  the  light  and  the  air. 
We  call  for  Thee  like  cows  that  have  not  been  milked. 
We  have  no  friend  but  Thee,  no  other  father,  O  mighty  I'* 
>  — Rig-Veda. 

The  name  of  this  deity  is  Brahma, 
sented  by  the  three  personified 
powers  of  creation,  preservation^ 
and  destruction,  which  under  the 
respective  names  of  Brahma, 
Vishnu,  and  Siva,  form  the  Tri- 
mu?'ti  or  triad  of  principal  Hindu 
gods. 

Brah'ma. 

Brah'ma  is  the  creator  of  the 
universe,  and  the  source  from 
which  all  the  individual  deities 
have  sprung,  and  into  which  all 
will    ultimately    be    absorbed.  Trimurti.

'•  As  milk  changes  to  curd,  and  water  to  ice,  so  is  Brahma  vari- 
ously transformed  and  diversified,  without  aid  of  exterior  means 
of  any  sort."  The  human  soul,  according  to  the  Vedas,  is  a 
portion  of  the  supreme  ruler,  as  a  spark  is  of  the  fire. 

Vish'nu. 

Vish'nu  occupies  the  second  place  in  the  triad  of  the  Hindus, 
and  is  the  personification  of  the  preserving  principle.  To  pro- 
tect the  world  in  various  epochs  of  danger,  Vishnu  descended  to 
the  earth  in  different  incarnations  or  bodily  forms,  which  de- 
scents are  called  Avatars.     They  are  very  numerous,  but  ten  are

more  particularly  specified.  The  first  Avatar  was  as  Matsya,  the 
Fish,  under  which  form  Vishnu  preserved  Manu,  the  ancestor  of 
the  human  race,  during  a  universal  deluge.  The  second  Avatar 
was  in  the  form  of  a  Tortoise,  which  form  he  assumed  to  support 
the  earth  when  the  gods  were  churning  the  sea  for  the  beverage 
of  immortality,  Amrita. 

We  may  omit  the  other  Avatars,  which  were  of  the  same  gen- 
eral character,  that  is,  interpositions  to  protect  the  right  or  to 
punish  wrong-doers,  and  come  to  the  ninth,  which  is  the  most 
celebrated  of  the  Avatars  of  Vishnu,  in  which  he  appeared  in  the 
human  form  of  Krishna,  an  invincible  warrior,  who  by  his  ex- 
ploits relieved  the  earth  from  the  tyrants  who  oppressed  it.

STOBIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES. 


Buddha  is  by  the  followers  of  the  Brahmanical  religion  re» 
garded  as  a  delusive  incarnation  of  Vishnu,  assumed  by  him  in 
order  to  induce  the  Asuras,  opponents  of  the  gods,  to  abandon 
the  sacred  ordinances  of  the  Vedas,  by  which  means  they  lost 
their  strength  and  supremacy. 

Kalki  is  the  name  of  the  tenth  Avatar,  in  which  Vishnu  will 
tppear  at  the  end  of  the  present  age  of  the  world  to  destroy  all 
lice  and  wickedness,  and  to  restore  mankind  to  virtue  and  purity. 

Si'va. 

Si'va  is  the  third  person  of  the  Hindu  triad.  He  is  the  per- 
sonification of  the  de- 
stroying principle. 
Though  the  third 
name,  he  is,  in  respect 
to  the  number  of  his 
worshippers  and  the  ex- 
tension of  his  worship, 
before  either  of  the 
others.  In  the  Pura- 
nas  (the  scriptures  of 
the  modern  Hindu  re- 
ligion) no  allusion  is 
made  to  the  original 
power  of  this  god  as  a 
destroyer,  that  power 
not  being  to  be  called 
into  exercise  till  after 
the  expiration  of  twelve 
millions  of  years,  or 
when  the  universe  will 
come  to  an  end ;  and 
Mahadeva  (another  name  for  Siva)  is  rather  the  representative 
of  regeneration  than  of  destruction. 

The  worshippers  of  Vishnu  and  Siva  form  two  sects,  each  of 
which  proclaims  the  superiority  of  its  favorite  deity,  denying  the 
claims  of  the  other ;  and  Brahma,  the  creator,  having  finished  his 
work,  seems  to  be  regarded  as  no  longer  active,  and  has  now 
only  one  temple  in  India,  while  Mahadeva  and  Vishnu  have

many.  The  worshippers  of  Vishnu  are  generally  distinguished 
by  a  greater  tenderness  for  life  and  consequent  abstinence  from 
animal  food,  and  a  worship  less  cruel  than  that  of  the  followers 
of  Siva. 

When  the  first  Vedic  poet  subjected  the  gods  to  a  formal  cen- 
sus, he  found  there  were  but  thirty-three.*  This  number,  how-i 
ever,  soon  increased  to  over  three  thousand.  They  were  divided 
into  three  classes — those  of  Light,  Air,  and  Earth.     Surya  was 


Indra. 


the  god  of  the  sun  ;  Indra,  the  god  of  heaven,  of  thunder,  light- 
ning, storm  and  rain  ;  Agni,  the  god  of  fire  ;  and  Yama,  the  god, 
of  the  infernal  regions.  Each  of  these  is  attended  by  a  legion 
of  deities  quite  as  great  as  himself.  There  are  also  goddesses 
without  number.  Thus  Vach,  the  goddess  of  learning,  became 
the  consort  of  Brahma,  and  Laksmi,  the  queen  of  beauty,  that

great  antiquity.  According  to  it,  the  self-existing  power  created 
an  eggy  out  of  which  he  himself  was  born  as  Brahma.  The  hope 
of  reward  is  made  the  motive  of  all  effort.  Meditation  is  en- 
joined, and  the  transmigration  of  souls  fully  expounded.  The 
change  is  shaped  by  the  life — the  one  who  stole  grain  is  reborn 
&s  a  rat,  and  a  meat  thief  becomes  a  vulture.

Jug'ger-naut. 

Whether  the  worshippers  of  Juggernaut  are  to  be  reckoned 
among  the  followers  of  Vishnu  or  Siva,  our  authorities  differ. 
The  temple  stands  near  the  shore,  about  three  hundred  miles 
south-west  of  Calcutta.  The  idol  is  a  carved  block  of  wood, 
with  a  hideous  face,  painted  black,  and  a  distended  blood -red 
mouth.  On  festival  days  the  throne  of  the  image  is  placed  on 
a  tower  sixty  feet  high,  moving  on  wheels.  Six  long  ropes  are 
attached  to  the  tower,  by  which  the  people  draw  it  along.  The 
priests  and  their  attendants  stand  round  the  throne  on  the  tower, 
and  occasionally  turn  to  the  worshippers  with  songs  and  ges- 
tures. While  the  tower  moves  along  numbers  of  the  devout 
worshippers  throw  themselves  on  the  ground,  in  order  to  be 
crushed  by  the  wheels,  and  the  multitude  shout  in  approbation 
of  the  act,  as  a  pleasing  sacrifice  to  the  idol.*  Every  year,  par- 
ticularly at  two  great  festivals  in  March  and  July,  pilgrims  flock 
in  crowds  to  the  temple.  Not  less  than  seventy  or  eighty  thou- 
sand people  are  said  to  visit  the  place  on  these  occasions,  when 
all  castes  eat  together. 

Castes. 

The  division  of  the  Hindus  into  classes  or  castes  with  fixed 
occupations,  existed  from  the  earliest  times.  It  is  supposed  by 
some  to  have  been  founded  upon  conquest,  the  first  three  castes 
being  composed  of  a  foreign  race,  who  subdued  the  natives  of

the  country  and  reduced  them  to  an  inferior  caste.  Others 
trace  it  to  the  fondness  of  perpetuating,  by  descent  from  father 
to  son,  certain  offices  or  occupations. 

The  Hindu  tradition  gives  the  following  account  of  the  origin 
of  the  various  castes.  At  the  creation  Brahma  resolved  to  give 
the  earth  inhabitants  who  should  be  direct  emanations  from  his 
own  body.  Accordingly  from  his  mouth  came  forth  the  eldest 
born,  Brahma  (the  priest),  to  whom  he  confided  the  fourVedas; 
from  his  right  arm  issued  Shatriya  (the  warrior),  and  from  his 
left  the  warrior's  wife.  His  thighs  produced  Vaissyas,  male  and 
female  (agriculturists  and  traders),  and  lastly  from  his  feet  sprang 
Sudras  (mechanics  and  laborers). 


Brahma  with  Saraswati. 

The  four  sons  of  Brahma,  so  significantly  brought  into  the 
world,  became  the  fathers  of  the  human  race,  and  heads  of  their 
respective  castes.  They  were  commanded  to  regard  the  four 
Vedas  as  containing  all  the  rules  of  their  faith,  and  all  that  was 
necessary  to  guide  them  in  their  religious  ceremonies.  They 
were  also  commanded  to  take  rank  in  the  order  of  their  birth, 
the  Brahmans  uppermost,  as  having  sprung  from  the  head  of 
Brahma. 

A  strong  line  of  demarcation  is  drawn  between  the  first  three 
wastes  and  the  Sudras.  The  former  are  allowed  to  receive  in- 
struction from  the  Vedas,  which  is  not  permitted  to  the  Sudras. 


404  STORIES  OF  OODS  AND  HEROES 

The  Brahmans  possess  the  privilege  of  teaching  the  Vedas,  and 
were  in  former  times  in  exclusive  possession  of  all  knowledge. 
Though  the  sovereign  of  the  country  was  chosen  from  the  Sha- 
triya  class,  also  called  Rajputs,  the  Brahmans  possessed  the  real 
power,  and  were  the  royal  counsellors,  the  judges  and  magis- 
trates of  the  country ;  their  persons  and  property  were  invio- 
lable, and  though  they  committed  the  greatest  crimes^  they  could 
only  be  banished  from  the  kingdom.  They  were  to  be  treated 
by  sovereigns  with  the  greatest  respect,  for  **a  Brahman,  whether 
learned  or  ignorant,  is  a  powerful  divinity." 

When  the  Brahman  arrives  at  years  of  maturity  it  becomes  his 
duty  to  marry.  He  ought  to  be  supported  by  the  contributions 
of  the  rich,  and  not  be  obliged  to  gain  his  subsistence  by  any 
laborious  or  productive  occupation.  But  as  all  the  Brahmans 
could  not  be  maintained  by  the  working  classes  of  the  com- 
munity, it  was  found  necessary  to  allow  them  to  engage  in  pro- 
ductive employments. 

We  need  say  little  of  the  two  intermediate  classes,  whose  rank 
and  privileges  may  be  readily  inferred  from  their  occupations. 
The  Sudras  or  fourth  class  are  bound  to  servile  attendance  on 
the  higher  classes,  especially  the  Brahmans,  but  they  may  follow 
mechanical  occupations  and  practical  arts,  as  painting  and  writ- 
ing, or  become  traders  or  husbandmen.  Consequently  they 
sometimes  grow  rich,  and  it  will  also  sometimes  happen  that 
Brahmans  become  poor.  That  fact  works  its  usual  consequence, 
and  rich  Sudras  sometimes  employ  poor  Brahmans  in  menial 
occupations. 

There  is  another  class  lower  even  than  the  Sudras,  for  it  is  not 
one  of  the  original  pure  classes,  but  springs  from  an  unauthorized 
union  of  individuals  of  different  castes.  These  are  the  Pariahs, 
who  are  employed  in  the  lowest  services  and  treated  with  the  ut- 
most severity.  They  are  compelled  to  do  what  no  one  else  can 
do  without  pollution.  They  are  not  only  considered  unclean 
themselves,  but  they  render  unclean  every  thing  they  touch. 
They  are  deprived  of  all  civil  rights,  and  stigmatized  by  particu- 
lar laws,  regulating  their  mode  of  life,  their  houses,  and  their 
furniture.  They  are  not  allowed  to  visit  the  pagodas  or  temple? 
of  the  other  castes,  but  have  their  own  pagodas  and  religious  ex- 
ercises.    They  are  not  suffered  to  enter  the  houses  of  the  othei

castes;  if  it  is  done  incautiously  or  from  necessity,  the  place 
must  be  purified  by  religious  ceremonies.  They  must  not  appear 
ui  public  markets,  and  are  confined  to  the  use  of  particular  wells, 
which  they  arc  obliged  to  surround  with  bones  of  animals,  to 
warn  others  against  using  them.  They  dwell  in  miserable  hovels, 
distant  from  cities  and  villages,  and  are  under  no  restrictions  in 
regard  to  food,  which  last  is  not  a  privilege,  but  a  mark  of 
ignominy,  as  if  they  were  so  degraded  that  nothing  could  pollute 
them.  The  three  higher  castes  are  prohibited  entirely  the  use 
of  flesh.  The  fourth  is  allowed  to  eat  all  kinds  except  beef,  but 
only  the  lowest  caste  is  allowed  every  kind  of  food  without 
restriction. 

Bud'dha. 

Bud'dha,  whom  the  Vedas  represent  as  a  delusive  incarna- 
tion of  Vishnu,  is  said  by  his  followers  to  have  been  a  mortal 
«age,   whose  name  was  Gautama, 
called  also  by  the  complimentary 
epithets  of  Sakyasinha,  the  Lion, 
and  Buddha,  the  Sage. 

By  a  comparison  of  the  various 
epochs  assigned  to  his  birth,  it  is 
inferred  that  he  lived  about  one 
thousand  years  before  Christ. 

He  was  the  son  of  a  king ;  and 
when,  in  conformity  to  the  usage 
of  the  country,  he  was,  a  few  days 
after  his  birth,  presented  before  the 
altar  of  a  deity,  the  image  is  said 
to  have   inclined  its  head,  as  a 

presage  of  the  future  greatness  of  the  new-born  prophet.  The 
child  soon  developed  faculties  of  the  first  order,  and  became 
equally  diatinguished  by  the  uncommon  beauty  of  his  person 
No  sooner  had  he  grown  to  years  of  maturity  than  he  began  to 
reflect  deeply  on  the  depravity  and  misery  of  mankind,  and  he 
conceived  the  idea  of  retiring  from  society  and  devoting  himself 
to  meditation.  His  father  in  vain  opposed  this  design.  Buddha 
escaped  the  vigilance  of  his  guards,  and  having  found  a  secure 
retreat,  lived  for  six  years  undisturbed  in  his  devout  contempla- 
tions.    At  the  expiration  of  that  period  he  came   forward  al

tree  afterwards  became  universally  famous. 

•*  The  B6dhi  tree,  thenceforth  in  all  years 
Never  to  fade  and  ever  to  be  kept 
In  homage  of  the  world,  beneath  whose  leaves

Buddha." — Edwin  Arnold. 

At  first  some  who  heard  him  doubted  of  the  soundness  of  his 
mind ;  but  his  doctrines  soon  gained  credit,  and  were  propa- 
gated so  rapidly  that  Buddha  himself  lived  to  see  them  spread  all 
over  India. 

The  name  Buddha  means  learned,  and  the  reformer's  life  is 
divided  by  his  followers  into  twelve  sections.  He  determined 
while  in  the  fourth  heaven  to  save  the  earth,  and  descended  as 
a  white  elephant.  He  was  conceived  as  a  five-colored  ray  of 
light,  and  born  amid  great  miraculous  demonstration.  His 
philosophy  consisted  of  four  truths  :  Misery  accompanies  exist- 
ence ;  existence  is  desire  ;  to  escape  existence  desire  must  be  de- 
stroyed ;  this  is  obtained  by  reaching  Nirvana.  By  Nirvana  is 
meant  an  absorption  into  a  condition  of  absolute  indifference. 

**  That  each  who  seems  a  separate  whole 

Should  move  his  rounds,  and,  fusing  all, 
The  skirts  of  self  again  should  fall, 
Remerging  in  the  general  Soul." — Tennyson. 

These  truths,  in  turn,  are  only  made  possible  by  walking  in  the 
four  paths  of  Buddhism. 

The  Buddhists  reject  entirely  the  authority  of  the  Vedas,  and 
the  religions  observances  prescribed  in  them  and  kept  by  the 
Hindus.  They  also  reject  the  distinction  of  castes,  and  prohibit 
all  bloody  sacrifices,  and  allow  animal  food.  Their  priests  are 
chosen  from  all  classes  ;  they  are  expected  to  procure  their  main- 
tenance  by  perambulation  and  begging,  and  among  other  things 
it  is  their  duty  to  endeavor  to  turn  to  some  use  things  thrown 
aside  as  useless  by  others,  and  to  discover  the  medicinal  power 
of  plants.     But  in  Ceylon  three  orders  of  priests  are  recognized. 


THE  GRAND  LAMA,  407 

Those  of  the  highest  order  are  usually  men  of  high  birth  and 
learning,  and  are  supported  at  the  principal  temples,  most  of 
which  have  been  richly  endowed  by  the  former  monarchs  of  the 
country. 

For  several  centuries  after  the  appearance  of  Buddha  his  sect 
seems  to  have  been  tolerated  by  the  Brahmans,  and  Buddhism 
appears  to  have  penetrated  the  peninsula  of  Hindustan  in  every 
direction,  and  to  have  been  carried  to  Ceylon  and  to  the  eastern 
peninsula.  But  afterwards  it  had  to  endure  in  India  a  long-con- 
tinued persecution,  which  ultimately  had  the  effect  of  entirely 
abolishing  it  in  the  country  where  it  had  originated,  but  to  scat- 
ter it  widely  over  adjacent  countries.  Buddhism  appears  to  have 
been  introduced  into  China  about  the  year  sixty-five  of  our  era. 
From  China  it  was  subsequently  extended  to  Corea,  Japan,  and 
Java. 

Buddha  is  said  to  have  died  in  the  odor  of  sanctity  at  the  ad- 
vanced age  of  eighty  years.  There  is  a  legend  that  when  his 
body  was  placed  upon  the  funeral  pile  the  wood  refused  to  bum 
until  the  *  *  flame  of  contemplation  ' '  broke  out  from  the  breast 
of  a  disciple  and  consumed  it  to  ashes.  His  bones,  as  his  fol- 
lowers believe,  still  remain  upon  the  earth  as  objects  of  worship, 
while  he  himself  has  gone 

"Unto  Nirvana,  where  the  Silence  lives." 

— Edwin  Arnold. 

The  Grand  La'ma. 

It  is  a  doctrine  alike  of  the  Brahminical  Hindus  and  of  the 
Buddhist  sect  that  the  confinement  of  the  human  soul,  an  emana- 
tion of  the  divine  spirit,  in  a  human  body,  is  a  state  of  misery, 
and  the  consequence  of  frailties  and  sins  committed  during 
former  existences.  But  they  hold  that  some  few  individuals 
have  appeared  on  this  earth,  from  time  to  time,  not  under  the 
necessity  of  terrestrial  existence,  but  who  voluntarily  descended 
to  the  earth  to  promote  the  welfare  of  mankind.  These  indi- 
viduals have  gradually  assumed  the  character  of  reappearances 
of  Buddha  himself,  in  which  capacity  the  line  is  continued  till 
the  present  day,  in  the  several  Lamas  of  Thibet,  China,  and  other 
countries  where  Buddhism  prevails.  In  consequence  of  the 
victories  of  Genghis  Khan  and  his  successors,  the  Lama  residing

in  Thibet  was  raised  to  the  dignity  of  chief  pontiff  of  the  sect. 
A  separate  province  was  assigned  to  him  as  his  own  territory, 
and  besides  his  spiritual  dignity,  he  became  to  a  limited  extent 
a  temporal  monarch.     He  is  styled  the  Dalai  Lama. 

The  first  Christian  missionaries  who  proceeded  to  Thibet  were 
surprised  to  find  there  in  the  heart  of  Asia  a  pontifical  court  and 
several  other  ecclesiastical  institutions  resembling  those  of  the 
Roman  Catholic  Church.  They  found  convents  for  priests  and 
nuns ;  also  processions  and  forms  of  religious  worship,  attended 
with  much  pomp  and  splendor  ;  and  many  were  induced  by  these 
similarities  to  consider  Lamaism  as  a  sort  of  degenerated  Chris- 
tianity. It  is  not  improbable  that  the  Lamas  derived  some  of 
these  practices  from  the  Nestorian  Christians,  who  were  settled 
in  Tartary  when  Buddhism  was  introduced  into  Thibet. 

Prester  John. 

An  early  account,  communicated  probably  by  travelling  mer- 
chants, of  a  Lama  or  spiritual  chief  among  the  Tartars,  seems 
to  have  occasioned  in  Europe  the  report  of  a  Presbyter,  or 
Prester  John,  a  Christian  pontiff,  resident  in  Upper  Asia. 
The  Pope  sent  a  mission  in  search  of  him,  as  did  also  Louis  IX. 
of  France,  some  years  later ;  but  both  missions  were  unsuccess- 
ful, though  the  small  communities  of  Nestorian  Christians,  which 
they  did  find,  served  to  keep  up  the  belief  in  Europe  that  such  a 
personage  did  exist  somewhere  in  the  East.  Plis  identity  haa 
never  been  settled.

Northern  Mythology. 

The  stories  which  have  engaged  our  attention  thus  far  relate 
to  the  mythology  of  southern  regions.  But  there  is  anothe/ 
branch  of  ancient  superstitions  which  ought  not  to  be  entirely 
overlooked,  especially  as  it  belongs  to  the  nations  from  which 
we,  through  our  English  ancestors,  derive  our  origin.  It  is  that 
of  the  northern  nations  called  Scandinavians,  who  inhabited  the 
countries  now  known  as  Sweden,  Denmark,  Norway,  and  Ice- 
land. These  mythological  records  are  contained  in  two  collec- 
tions called  the  Eddas,  of  which  the  oldest  is  in  poetry  and  date»

back  to  the  year  ten  hundred  and  fifty-six,  the  more  modern  of 
prose  Edda  being  of  the  date  of  sixteen  hundred  and  forty.' 
The  Scandinavians  also  had  their  golden  age. 

'*  The  golden  aeje  of  the  gods,  when 
On  the  green  they  played 
In  joyful  mood, 
Nor  knew  at  all 
The  want  of  good." — (Anderson,  tr.). 

According  to  the  Eddas  there  was  once  no  heaven  above  nor 
earth  beneath,  but  only  a  bottomless  deep,  and  a  world  of  mist 
in  which  flowed  a  fountain.  Twelve  rivers  issued  from  this  foun- 
tain, and  when  they  had  flowed  far  from  their  source  they  froze 
into  ice,  and,  one  layer  accumulating  over  another,  the  great  deep 
was  filled  up. 

Southward  from  the  world  of  mist  was  the  world  of  light. 
From  this  flowed  a  warm  wind  upon  the  ice  and  melted  it. 

**  From  the  South  the  Sun 
Shone  on  the  walls; 
Then  did  the  earth 
Green  herbs  produce. 
The  Moon  went  ahead, 
The  Sun  followed  ; 
His  right  hand  held 
The  steeds  of  heaven." — Eddas  (Anderson;. 

The  vapors  rose  in  the  air  and  formed  clouds,  from  which  sprang 
Ymir,  the  Frost  giant,  and  his  progeny,  and  the  cow  Audhumbla, 
whose  milk  afforded  nourishment  and  food  for  the  giant.  The 
cow  got  nourishment  by  licking  the  hoar-frost  and  salt  from  the 
ice.  While  she  was  one  day  licking  the  salt -stones  there!  ap- 
peared at  first  the  hair  of  a  man,  on  the  second  day  the  whole 
head,  and  on  the  third  the  entire  form,  endowed  with  beauty, 
agility,  and  power.  This  new  being  was  a  god,  from  whom  and 
his  wife,  a  daughter  of  the  giant  race,  sprang  the  three  brothers, 
Odin,  Vili,  and  Ve.     They  slew  the  giant  Ymir,  and  out  of  his 

*  The  elder  Edda  consists  of  thirty-seven  poems,  and,  like  the  prose  Edda, 
treats  of  gods, legends,  and  Scandinavian  wars.    The  word  means  "great-grand 
mother,"  and  probably  refers  to  the  stories  told  by  the  grandmothers  to  theij 
children.

body  formed  the  earth,  of  his  blood  the  seas,  of  his  bones  the 
mountains,  of  his  hair  the  trees,  of  his  skull  the  heavens,  and  of 
his  brain  clouds,  charged  with  hail  and  snow.  Of  Ymir'seye- 
browns  the  gods  formed  Midgard  (mid  earth),  destined  to  become 
the  abode  of  man. 


Odin. 


"  Of  Ymir's  flesh 
Was  earth  created, 
Of  his  blood  the  sea, 
Of  his  bones  the  hills. 
Of  his  hair  trees  and  plants, 
Of  his  skull  the  heavens, 
And  of  his  brows 
The  gentle  powers 

Formed  Midgard  for  the  sons  of  men ; 
But  of  his  brain 
The  heavy  clouds  are 
AU  created."— Eddas  (Anderson). 


412  STORIES  OF  QODS  AND  HEROES. 

Odin  then  regulated  the  periods  of  day  and  night  and  the  sea- 
sons  by  placing  in  the  heavens  the  sun  and  moon,  and  appoint- 
ing to  them  their  respective  courses.  As  soon  as  the  sun  began 
to  shed  its  rays  upon  the  earth  it  caused  the  vegetable  world  to 
bud  and  sprout.  Shortly  after  the  gods  had  created  the  world 
they  walked  by  the  side  of  the  sea,  pleased  with  their  new  work, 
but  found  that  it  was  still  incomplete,  for  it  was  without  human 
beings.  They  therefore  took  an  ash  tree  and  made  a  man  out 
of  it,  and  they  made  a  woman  out  of  an  alder,  and  called  the 
man  Aske  and  the  woman  Embla.  Odin  then  gave  them  life  and 
soul,  Vili  reason  and  motion,  and  Ve  bestowed  upon  them  the 
senses,  expressive  features,  and  speech.  Midgard  was  then  given 
them  as  their  residence,  and  they  became  the  progenitors  of  the 
human  race. 

The  mighty  ash  tree  Ygdrasill  was  supposed  to  support  the 
whole  universe.  It  sprang  from  the  body  of  Ymir,  and  had 
three  immense  roots,  extending  one  into  Asgard  (the  dwelling 
of  the  gods),  the  other  into  Jotunheim  (the  abode  of  the  giants), 
and  the  third  to  Niffleheim  (the  regions  of  darkness  and  cold). 
By  the  side  of  each  of  these  roots  is  a  spring,  from  which  it  is 
watered.  The  root  that  extends  into  Asgard  is  carefully  tended 
by  the  three  Norns,  goddesses,  who  are  regarded  as  the  dispensers 
of  fate.  They  are  Urdur  (the  past),  Verdandi  (the  present), 
Skuld  (the  future).  The  spring  at  the  Jotunheim  side  is  Ymir's 
well,  in  which  wisdom  and  wit  lie  hidden  ;  but  thatof  Niffleheim 
feeds  the  adder  Nidhogge  (darkness),  which  perpetually  gnaws 
at  the  root.  Four  harts  run  across  the  branches  of  the  tree  and 
bite  the  buds ;  they  represent  the  four  winds.  Under  the  tree 
lies  Ymir,  and  when  he  tries  to  shake  off  its  weight  the  eaith 
quakes. 

"  The  tree  Ygdrasill 
Bears  a  sorer  burden 
Than  men  imagine  ; 
Above  the  stags  bite  it« 
On  its  sides  age  rots  it, 
Nidhogge  gnaws  below."  ^ — Eddas  (  Anderson )c 

Asgard  is  the  name  of  the  abode  of  the  gods,  access  to  which 
is  only  gained  by  crossing  the  bridge  Bifrost   (the  rainbow). 


OF  THE  JOYS  OF  VALHALLA,  413 

*'  A  link 
That  binds  us  to  the  skies, 
A  bridge  of  rainbow  thrown  across 
The  gulf  of  tears  and  sighs." — Barry  Cornwall. 

Asgard  consists  of  golden  and  silver  palaces,  the  dwellings  of  the 
gods  ;  but  the  most  beautiful  of  these  is  Valhalla,  the  residence 
of  Odin.  When  seated  on  his  throne  he  overlooks  all  heaven 
and  earth.  Upon  his  shoulders  are  the  ravens  Hugin  and  Munin, 
who  fly  every  day  over  the  whole  world,  and  on  their  return  re- 
port to  him  all  they  have  seen  and  heard.  At  his  feet  lie  his  two 
wolves,  Geri  and  Freki,  to  whom  Odin  gives  all  the  meat  that  is 
set  before  him,  for  he  himself  stands  in  no  need  of  food.  Mead 
is  for  him  both  food  and  drink.  He  invented  the  Runic  charac- 
ters, and  it  is  the  business  of  the  Norns  to  engrave  the  runes  of 
fate  upon  a  metal  shield.  From  Odin's  name,  spelt  Woden,  as 
it  sometimes  is,  came  Wednesday,  the  name  of  the  fourth  day 
of  the  week. 

Odin  is  frequently  called  Alfadur  (All-father),  but  this  name 
is  sometimes  used  in  a  way  that  shows  that  the  Scandinavians 
had  an  idea  of  a  deity  superior  to  Odin,  uncreated  and  eternal. 

Of  the  Joys  of  Valhalla. 

Valhalla  is  the  great  hall  of  Odin,  wherein  he  feasts,  with  his 
chosen  heroes,  those  who  have  fallen  bravely  in  battle ;  for  all 
who  die  a  peaceful  death  are  excluded.  The  flesh  of  the  boar 
Schrimnir  is  served  up  to  them,  and  is  abundant  for  all ;  for 
although  this  boar  is  cooked  every  morning,  he  becomes  whole 
again  every  night.  For  drink  the  heroes  are  supplied  abundantly 
with  mead  from  the  she-goat  Heidrun.  When  the  heroes  are 
not  feasting  they  amuse  themselves  with  fighting.  Every  day  they 
ride  out  into  the  court  or  field  and  fight  until  they  cut  each  other 
in  pieces.  This  is  their  pastime  ;  but  when  meal-time  comes  they 
recover  from  their  wounds  and  return  to  feast  in  Valhalla.

Origin  of  Poetry. 

The  Norsemen  held  the  gift  of  poetry  in  the  highest  esteenie 
Poetry  itself  was  an  inspiring  drink.  This  drink  was  possessed 
by  the  giants  and  guarded  by  Gunlad.  One  of  the  gods  en- 
quired of  Bragi  how  poetry  originated.  He  was  told  that  the 
Asas  and  Vans  at  the  close  of  a  long  war  ratified  a  treaty  of  peace 
by  spitting  in  a  jar.  From  this  spittle  was  created  a  wise  man, 
whom  they  called  Kvaser.  His  wisdom  transcended  all  ques- 
tions. He  was  slain,  however,  by  two  dwarfs,  and  his  blood 
preserved  in  Odroerer,  a  kettle,  and  two  cups.  Son  and  Bodn. 
By  mixing  this  blood  with  honey  a  drink  was  composed,  of 
which,  if  one  partook,  he  became  a  poet.  The  dwarfs  then  an- 
nounced that  Kvaser  had  been  suffocated  by  his  own  wisdom. 
The  dwarfs  also  slew  a  giant  by  the  name  of  Gilling,  and  his 
wife.  Their  son  Suttung  induced  his  parents'  murderers  to 
accompany  him  out  to  a  shoal  in  the  sea,  where  he  left  them  to 
perish  in  the  tide.  In  order  to  save  their  lives  they  gave  Sut- 
tung the  poetic-inspiring  beverage,  which  he  committed  to  Gun- 
lad,  his  daughter.  Odin  the  god  made  a  special  journey  to 
Jotunheim  in  order  to  obtain  this  enchanting  mead.  He  first 
met  nine  slaves  mowing  in  a  meadow.  Entering  into  conversa- 
tion, he  offered  to  whet  their  scythes.  This  he  did,  after  which 
he  threw  the  whetstone  into  the  air.  The  slaves  fought  for  it, 
arkd,  falling  upon  their  scythes,  were  killed.  Odin  then  went  t-) 
the  home  of  the  farmer  and  learned  that  he  was  Bauge,  the 
brother  of  Suttung.  In  Bauge' s  distress  over  the  death  of  his 
slaves  Odin  offered  to  remain  and  do  the  work  of  nine  men  for 
one  draught  of  his  brother's  mead.  Bauge  consented,  and  took 
Odin  to  the  cave  where  Gunlad  guarded  the  precious  liquid. 
The)'  bored  through  the  rock,  and  Odin,  transformed  as  a  ser- 
pent, crept  through  the  hole,  resumed  his  natural  shape,  and 
made  love  to  Gunlad. 


TME  VALKYRWR.  4I5 

"Odin,  1  believe, 
A  ring-oath  gave ; 
Who  In  his  faith  will  trust  ? 
Suttung  defrauded, 
OJ  his  drink  bereft. 
And  Gunlad  made  to  vi^eep.' 

— Eddas  (Anderson). 

She  permitted  him  to  take  a  single  draught  from  each  of  the 
three  vessels,  but  Odin,  in  his  anxiety,  drank  all  three  dry. 
He  then,  transformed  as  an  eagle,  flew  toward  Asgard.  Surtung, 
aware  of  the  deception,  in  the  same  guise  followed.  The  gods, 
seemg  their  approach,  set  out  all  the  jars  in  their  possession. 
Odin  disgorged  the  inspiring  mead  through  his  beak.  That  which 
fell  in  the  vessels  was  true  poetry,  and  that  which  was  spilled  upon 
the  ground  belongs  to  the  silly  poets.  Hence  a  poet  became 
known  as  one  who  had  drunk  the  beverage  of  the  gods. 

Sa'ga. 

Odin  not  only  invented  poetry,  but  also  favors  history.  This 
is  called  Sa'ga. 

••  Sokvabek,  hight  the  fourth  dwelling, 
Over  it  flow  the  cool  billows  ; 
Glad  drink  there  Odin  and  Saga 
Every  day  from  golden  cups.*' 

Sokvabek  is  the  brook  of  the  deep.  From  the  deep  arise  the 
thoughts,  and  roll  as  cool,  refreshing  waves  through  golden  words. 
Saga  can  tell,  Odin  can  think  about  it.  Thus  they  sit  together 
day  after  day  and  night  after  night,  and  refresh  their  minds  from 
the  fountain  of  history.  Saga  is  the  second  of  the  goddesses. 
Her  favor  is  the  hope  of  youth  and  the  delight  of  the  old.* 

The  Valkyrior,  , 

The  Valkyrior  are  warlike  virgins,  mounted  upon  horses,  and 
armed  with  helmets,  shields,  and  spears.  Odin,  who  is  desirous 
to  collect  a  great  many  heroes  in  Valhalla,  to  be  able  to  meet  the 
giants  in  a  day  when  the  final  contest  must  come,  sends  down  to 
every  battle-field  to  make  choice  of  those  who  shall  be  slain.

split  many  a  skull  of  their  fathers  and  kindred.  When  thrown, 
it  returns  to  his  hand  of  its  own  accord.  The  second  rare  thing 
he  possesses  is  called  the  belt  of  strength.  When  he  girds  it 
about  him  his  divine  might  is  doubled.  The  third,  also  very 
precious,  is  his  iron  gloves,  which  he  puts  on  whenever  he  would 
use  his  mallet  efficiently.

(fairies).  She  is  very  fond  of  love-ditties,  and  all  lovers  do 
well  to  invt)ke  her. 

Freya  is  usually  identified  with  Frigga,  the  wife  of  Odin,  and 
queen  of  the  Scandinavian  heaven.  This  goddess  was  the 
patroness  of  ships,  and  brought  lovers  together  after  death.  She 
is  represented  as  spinning  on  a  golden  distaff,  the  wheel  of  whicn

Friday  was  named  in  her  honor.  This  day  was  originally  re- 
garded as  the  most  fortunate  of  the  week ;  but  the  historic  asso- 
ciation of  the  Crucifixion  reversed  the  position,  and' Friday  fell 
from  the  highest  to  the  lowest  place  in  the  calendar. 

Bragi  is  the  god  of  poetry,  and  his  song  records  the  deeds  of 
warriors.  His  wife,  Iduna,  keeps  in  a  box  the  apples  which  the 
gods,  when  they  feel  old  age  approaching,  have  only  to  taste  of 
to  become  young  again. 

Heimdall  is  the  watchman  of  the  gods,  and  is  therefore  placed 
on  the  borders  of  heaven,  to  prevent  the  giants  from  forcing  their 
way  over  the  bridge  Bifrost  (the  rainbow).  The  sound  of 
Helmdall's  horn  is  heard  over  the  world,  and  shall  be  the  signal 
for  the  great  battle  between  the  gods  on  the  day  of  their  ending, 
or  twilight.  He  requires  less  sleep  than  a  bird,  and  sees  by 
night  as  well  as  by  day  a  hundred  miles  around  him.  So  acute 
is  his  ear  that  no  sound  escapes  him,  for  he  can  even  hear  the 
grass  grow  and  the  wool  on  a  sheep's  back. 

Of  Loki  and  His  Progeny. 

There  is  another  deity  who  is  described  as  the  calumniator  of 
the  gods  and  the  contriver  of  all  fraud  and  mischief.  His  name 
is  Lroki.  He  is  handsome  and  well  made,  but  of  a  very  fickle 
mood,  and  most  evil  disposition.  He  is  of  the  giant  race,  but 
forced  himself  into  the  company  of  the  gods,  and  seems  to  take 
pleasure  in  bringing  them  into  difficulties,  and  in  extricating 
them  out  of  the  danger  by  his  cunning,  wit,  and  skill.  Loki  has 
three  children.     The  first  is  the  wolf  Fenris, 

**  Fearfully  fares 
The  Fenris  wolf 
Over  the  fields  of  men, 
When  he  is  loosed." — Eddas  (Anderson). 

the  second  the  Midgard  serpent, the  third  Hela  (Death).  The  gods 
were  not  ignorant  that  these  monsters  were  growing  up,  and  that 
they  would  one  day  bring  much  evil  upon  gods  and  men.  So 
Odin  deemed  it  advisable  to  send  one  to  bring  them  to  him. 
When  they  came,  he  threw  the  serpent  into  that  deep  ocean  by 
which  the  earth  is  surrounded.  But  the  monster  has  grown  to  such 
fin  enormous  size  that,  holding  his  tail  in  his  mouth,  he  encircles

the  whole  earth.  Hela  he  cast  into  Niffleheim,  and  gave  her 
power  over  nine  worlds  or  regions,  into  which  she  distributes 
those  who  are  sent  to  her  ;  that  is,  all  who  die  ofsiclcness  or  old 
age.  Her  hall  is  called  Elvidnir.  Hunger  is  her  table,  Starva- 
tion her  knife,  Delay  her  man,  Slowness  her  maid.  Precipice  hei

The  wolf  Fenris  gave  the  gods  a  great  deal  of  trouble  before 
they  succeeded  in  chaining  him.     He  broke  the  strongest  fetters

03  if  they  were  made  of  cobwebs.  Finally  the  gods  sent  a 
messenger  to  the  mountain  spirits,  who  made  for  them  the  chain 
called  Gleipnir,  It  is  fashioned  of  six  things,  viz.,  the  noise 
made  by  the  footfall  of  a  cat,  the  beards  of  women,  the  roots  of 
stones,  the  breath  of  fishes,  the  nerves  (sensibilities)  of  bears, 
and  the  spittle  of  birds.  When  finished  it  was  as  smooth  and 
soft  as  a  silken  string.  But  when  the  gods  asked  the  wolf  to 
suffer  himself  to  be  bound  with  this  apparently  slight  ribbon 
he  suspected  their  design,  fearing  that  it  was  made  by  enchant- 
ment. He  therefore  only  consented  to  be  bound  with  it  upon 
condition  that  one  of  the  gods  put  his  hand  in  his  ( Fenris' s)

mouth  as  a  pledge  that  the  band  was  to  be  removed  again.  Tyi 
(the  god  of  battles)  alone  had  courage  enough  to  do  this.  But 
when  the  wolf  found  that  he  could  not  break  his  fetters,  and 
that  the  gods  would  not  release  him,  he  bit  off  Tyr's  hand,  and 
he  has  ever  since  remained  one-handed. 

How  Thor  Paid  the  Mountain  Giant  His  "Wages. 

Once  on  a  time,  when  the  gods  were  constructing  their  abodes, 
and  had  already  finished  Midgard  and  Valhalla,  a  certain  artificei 
came  and  offered  to  build  them  a  residence  so  well  fortified  that 
tney  should  be  perfectly  safe  from  the  incursions  of  the  Frost 
giants  and  the  giants  of  the  mountains.  But  he  demanded  for 
his  reward  the  goddess  Freya,  together  with  the  sun  and  moon. 
The  gods  yielded  to  his  terms,  provided  he  would  finish  the 
whole  work  himself,  without  any  one's  assistance,  and  all  within 
the  space  of  one  winter.  But  if  anything  remained  unfinished 
on  the  first  day  of  summer  he  should  forfeit  the  recompense 
agreed  on.  On  being  told  these  terms  the  artificer  stipulated 
that  he  should  be  allowed  the  use  of  his  horse  Svadilfari,  and 
this,  by  the  advice  of  Loki,  was  granted  to  him.  He  accordingly 
set  to  work  on  the  first  day  of  winter,  and  during  the  night  let 
his  horse  draw  stone  for  the  building.  The  enormous  size  of 
the  stones  struck  the  gods  with  astonishment,  and  they  saw  clearly 
that  the  horse  did  one-half  more  of  the  toilsome  work  than  his 
master.  Their  bargain,  however,  had  been  concluded  and  con- 
firmed by  solemn  oaths,  for  without  these  precautions  a  giant 
would  not  have  thought  himself  safe  among  the  gods,  especially 
when  Thor  should  return  from  an  expedition  he  had  then  under- 
taken against  the  evil  demons. 

As  the  winter  drew  to  a  close  the  building  was  far  advanced, 
iind  the  bulwarks  were  sulBciently  high  and  massive  to  render  the 
place  impregnable.  In  short,  when  it  wanted  but  three  days  to 
summer  the  only  part  that  remained  to  be  finished  was  the  gate- 
way. Then  sat  the  gods  on  their  seats  of  justice  and  entered  into 
consultation,  inquiring  of  one  another  who  among  them  could  have 
advised  to  give  Freya  away,  or  to  plunge  the  heavens  in  darkness 
by  permitting  the  giant  to  carry  away  the  sun  and  the  moon. 

They  all  agreed  that  no  one  but  Loki,  the  author  of  so  many 
evil  deeds,  could  have  given  such  bad   counsel,  and   that  hi

should  be  put  to  a  cruel  death  if  he  did  not  contrive  some  way 
to  prevent  the  artificer  from  completing  his  task  and  obtaining 
the  stipulated  recompense.  They  proceeded  to  lay  hands  on 
Loki,  who  in  his  fright  promised  upon  oath  that,  let  it  cost  him 
what  it  would,  he  would  so  manage  matters  that  the  man  should 
lose  his  reward.  That  very  night,  when  the  man  went  with 
Svadilfari  for  building-stone,  a  mare  suddenly  ran  out  of  a  forest 
and  began  to  neigh.  The  horse  thereat  broke  loose  and  ran 
after  the  mare  into  the  forest,  which  obliged  the  man  also  to  run 
after  his  horse,  and  thus  between  one  and  another  the  whole 
night  was  lost,  so  that  at  dawn  the  work  had  not  made  the  usual 
progress.  The  man,  seeing  that  he  must  fail  of  completing  his 
task,  resumed  his  own  gigantic  stature,  and  the  gods  now  clearly 
perceived  that  it  was  in  reality  a  mountain  giant  who  had  come 
amongst  them.  Feeling  no  longer  bound  by  their  oaths,  they 
called  on  Thor,  who  immediately  ran  to  their  assistance,  and 
lifting  up  his  mallet,  paid  the  workman  his  wages,  not  with  the 
sun  and  moon,  and  not  even  by  sending  him  back  to  Jotunheim, 
for  with  the  first  blow  he  shattered  the  giant's  skull  to  pieces  and 
hurled  him  headlong  into  Niffleheim. 

The  Recovery  of  the  Hammer, 

Once  upon  a  time  it  happened  that  Thor's  hammer  fell  into 
the  possession  of  the  giant  Thrym,  who  buried  it  eight  fathoms 
deep  under  the  rocks  of  Jotunheim.  Thor  sent  Loki  to  nego- 
tiate with  Thrym,  but  he  could  only  prevail  so  far  as  to  get  the 
giant's  promise  to  restore  the  weapon  if  Freya  would  consent  to 
be  his  bride.  Loki  returned  and  reported  the  result  of  his  mis- 
sion, but  the  goddess  of  love  was  quite  horrified  at  the  idea  of 
bestowing  her  charms  on  the  king  of  the  Frost  giants.  In  this 
emergency  Loki  persuaded  Thor  to  dress  himself  in  Freya' s 
clothes  and  accompany  him  to  Jotunheim.  Thrym  received  his 
veiled  bride  with  due  courtesy,  but  was  greatly  surprised  at  seeing 
ber  eat  for  her  supper  eight  salmon  and  a  full-grown  ox,  besides 
©♦"her  delicacies,  washing  the  whole  down  with  three  tons  of 
mead.

Loki,  however,  assured  him  that  she  had  not  tasted  anything 
for  eight  long  nights,  so  great  was  her  desire  to  see  her  lover, 
the  renowned  ruler  of  Jotunheim.  Thrym  had  at  length  the 
curiosity  to  peep   under  his  bride's  veil,  but  started  back  in

affright  and  demanded  why  Freya' s  eyeballs  glistened  with  fire. 
Loki  repeated  the  same  excuse,  and  the  giant  was  satisfied.  He 
ordered  the  hammer  to  be  brought  in  and  laid  on  the  maiden's 
lap.  Thereupon  Thor  threw  off  his  disguise,  grasped  his  re- 
doubted weapon,  and  slaughtered  Thrym  and  all  his  followers. 

Freyr  also  possessed  a  wonderful  weapon,  a  sword  which  would 
of  itself  spread  a  field  with  carnage  whenever  the  owner  desired 
it.  Freyr  parted  with  this  sword,  but  was  less  fortunate  than 
Thor  and  never  recovered  it.  It  happened  in  this  way  :  Frey?

whole  universe,  and  looking  round,  saw  far  off  in  the  giant's 
kingdom  a  beautiful  maid,  at  the  sight  of  whom  he  was  struck 
with  sudden  sadness,  insomuch  that  from  that  moment  he  could 
neither  sleep,  nor  drink,  nor  speak.  At  last  Skirnir,  his  messen- 
ger, drew  his  secret  from  him,  and  undertook  to  get  him  the 
maiden  for  his  bride  if  he  would  give  him  his  sword  as  a  reward. 
Freyr  consented  and  gave  him  the  sword,  and  Skirnir  set  off  on 
his  journey,  and  obtained  the  maiden's  promise  that  within  nii.e 
'nights  she  would  come  to  a  certain  place  and  there  wed  Freyr.

Skirnir  having   reported  the  success  of  his  errand,   Freyr  ex- 
claimed :

So  Freyr  obtained  Gerda,  the  most  beautiful  of  all  women,  for 
his  wife,  but  he  lost  his  sword.

CHAPTER  XXXIX. 

Thor's  Visit  to  Jotunheim. 

One  day  the  god  Thor,  with  his  servant  Thialfi,  and  accom- 
panied by  Loki,  set  out  on  a  journey  to  the  giant's  country. 
Thialfi  was  of  all  men  the  swiftest  of  foot.  He  bore  Thor's  wal- 
let, containing  their  provisions.  When  night  came  on  they 
found  themselves  in  an  immense  forest,  and  searched  on  all  sides 
for  a  place  where  they  might  pass  the  night,  and  at  last  came  to 
a  very  large  hall,  with  an  entrance  that  took  the  whole  breadth 
of  one  end  of  the  building.  Here  they  lay  down  to  sleep,  but 
towards  midnight  were  alarmed  by  an  earthquake  which  shook 
the  whole  edifice.  Thor,  rising  up,  called  on  his  companions  to 
seek  with  him  a  place  of  safety.  On  the  right  they  found  an  ad- 
joining chamber,  into  which  the  others  entered,  but  Thor  re- 
mained at  the  doorway  with  his  mallet  in  his  hand,  prepared  to 
defend  himself,  whatever  might  happen.  A  terrible  groaning 
was  heard  during  the  night,  and  at  dawn  of  day  Thor  went  out 
and  found  lying  near  him  a  huge  giant,  who  slept  and  snored  in 
the  way  that  had  alarmed  them  so.  It  is  said  that  for  once  Thor 
was  afraid  to  use  his  mallet,  and  as  the  giant  soon  waked  up, 
Thor  contented  himself  with  simply  asking  his  name. 

*'  My  name  is  Skrymir,'*  said  the  giant,  '*but  I  need  not  ask 
thy  name,  for  I  know  that  thou  art  the  god  Thor.  But  what  has 
become  of  my  glove?"  Thor  then  perceived  that  what  they 
had  taken  over  night  for  a  hall  was  the  giant's  glove,  and  the 
chamber  where  his  two  companions  had  sought  refuge  was  the 
thumb.  Skrymir  then  proposed  that  they  should  travel  in  com- 
pany, and  Thor  consenting,  they  sat  down  to  eat  their  breakfast, 
and  when  they  had  done,  Skrymir  packed  all  the  provisions  into 
one  wallet,  threw  it  over  his  shoulder,  and  strode  on  before  them, 
taking  such  tremendous  strides  that  they  were  hard  put  ta  it  to 


THORS  VISIT  TO  JOTUNHEIM  427 

keep  up  with  him.  So  they  travelled  the  whole  day,  and  at 
dusk  Skrymir  chose  a  place  for  them  to  pass  the  night  in  under 
a  large  oak  tree.  Skrymir  then  told  them  he  would  lie  down  to 
sleep.  **  But  take  ye  the  wallet,"  he  added,  **  and  prepare  your 
supper." 

Skrymir  soon  fell  asleep  and  began  to  snore  strongly ;  but 
when  Thor  tried  to  open  the  wallet  he  found  the  giant  had  tied 
it  up  so  tight  he  could  not  untie  a  single  knot.  At  last  Thor 
became  wroth,  and,  grasping  his  mallet  with  both  hands,  ht 
struck  a  furious  blow  on  the  giant's  head.  Skrymir,  awakening, 
merely  asked  whether  a  leaf  had  not  fallen  on  his  head,  and 
1/hether  they  had  supped  and  were  ready  to  go  to  sleep.  Thor 
answered  that  they  were  just  going  to  sleep,  and  so  saying  went 
and  laid  himself  down  under  another  tree.  But  sleep  came  not 
that  night  to  Thor,  and  when  Skrymir  snored  again,  so  loud  that 
the  forest  re-echoed  with  the  noise,  he  arose,  and  grasping  his 
mallet  launched  it  with  such  force  at  the  giant's  skull  that  it 
made  a  deep  dint  in  it.  Skrymir,  awakening,  cried  out, 
**  What's  the  matter?  are  there  any  birds  perched  on  this  tree? 
I  felt  some  moss  from  the  branches  fall  on  my  head.  How 
fares  it  with  thee,  Thor  ?' '  But  Thor  went  away  hastily,  saying 
that  he  had  just  then  awoke,  and  that  as  it  was  only  midnight, 
there  was  still  time  for  sleep.  He  however  resolved  that  if  he 
had  an  opportunity  of  striking  a  third  blow,  it  should  settle  all 
matters  between  them.  A  little  before  daybreak  he  perceived 
that  Skrymir  was  again  fast  asleep ;  then  Thor,  grasping  his 
mallet,  dashed  it  with  such  violence  that  it  forced  its  way  into 
the  giant's  skull  up  to  the  handle.  But  Skrymir  sat  up,  and, 
stroking  his  cheek,  said,  **  An  acorn  fell  on  my  head.  What ! 
Art  thou  awake,  Thor?  Methinks  it  is  time  for  us  to  get  up  and 
dress  ourselves ;  but  you  have  not  now  a  long  way  before  you  to 
the  city  called  Utgard.  I  have  heard  you  whispering  to  one 
another  that  I  am  not  a  man  of  small  dimensions  ;  but  if  you 
come  to  Utgard  you  will  see  there  many  men  much  taller  thai* 
I.  Wherefore  I  advise  you,  when  you  come  there,  not  to  make 
too  much  of  yourselves,  for  the  followers  of  Utgard-Loki  will  not 
brook  the  boasting  of  such  little  ffMows  as  you  are.  You  must 
take  the  road  that  leads  eastward  ;  mine  lies  northward ;  so  we 
must  part  here.'*

Hereupon  he  threw  his  wallet  over  his  shoulders  and  turned 
away  from  them  into  the  forest,  and  Thor  had  no  wish  to  stop 
him  or  to  ask  for  any  more  of  his  company. 

Thor  and  his  companions  proceeded  on  their  way,  and  towards 
^noon  descried  a  city  standing  in  the  middle  of  a  plain.  It  was 
so  lofty  that  they  were  obliged  to  bend  their  necks  quite  back 
on  their  shoulders  in  order  to  see  to  the  top  of  it.  On  arriving 
they  entered  the  city,  and  seeing  a  large  palace  before  them, 
with  the  door  wide  open,  they  went  in,  and  found  a  number  of 
men  of  prodigious  stature  sitting  on  benches  in  the  hall.  Going 
farther,  they  came  before  the  king,  U'tgard-Loki,  whom  they 
saluted  with  great  respect.  The  king,  regarding  them  with  a 
scornful  smile,  said :  **  If  I  do  not  mistake  me,  that  stripling 
yonder  must  be  the  god  Thor."  Then  addressing  himself  to 
Thor,  he  said:  ** Perhaps  thou  mayst  be  more  than  thou  ap- 
pearest  to  be.  What  are  the  feats  that  thou  and  thy  fellows 
deem  yourselves  skilled  in  ?  for  no  one  is  permitted  to  remain 
here  who  does  not,  in  some  feat  or  other,  excel  all  other  men." 

**The  feat  that  I  know,"  said  Loki,  **is  to  eat  quicker  than 
any  one  else,  and  in  this  I  am  ready  to  give  a  proof  against  any 
one  here  who  may  choose  to  compete  with  me." 

'*That  will  indeed  be  a  feat,"  said  Utgard-Loki,  *'if  thou 
performest  what  thou  promisest,  and  it  shall  be  tried  forth- 
with." 

He  then  ordered  one  of  his  men,  who  was  sitting  at  the  far- 
ther end  of  the  bench,  and  whose  name  was  Logi,  to  come  for- 
ward and  try  his  skill  with  Loki.  A  trough  filled  with  meat 
having  been  set  on  the  hall  floor,  Loki  placed  himself  at  one  end 
and  Logi  at  the  other,  and  each  of  them  began  to  eat  as 
fast  as  he  could,  until  they  met  in  the  middle  of  the  trough. 
But  it  was  found  that  Loki  had  only  eaten  the  flesh,  while  his 
adversary  had  devoured  both  flesh  and  bone,  and  the  trough  to 
boot.  All  the  company,  therefore,  adjudged  that  Loki  was 
vanquished. 

Utgard-Loki  then  asked  what  feat  the  young  man  who  accom- 
panied Thor  could  perform.  Thialfi  answered  that  he  would  run 
a  race  with  any  one  who  might  be  matched  against  him.  The 
king  observed  that  skill  in  running  was  something  to  boast  of, 
but  if  the  youth  would  win  the  match  he   must  display  great 


THORS  VISIT  TO  JOTUNHEIM,  429 

agility.  He  then  arose  and  went  with  all  who  were  present  to 
a  plain  where  there  was  good  ground  for  running  on,  and  calling 
a  young  man  named  Hugi,  bade  him  run  a  match  with  Thialfi. 
In  the  first  course  Hugi  so  much  outstripped  his  competitor  that 
he  turned  back  and  met  him  not  far  from  the  starting-place. 
Then  they  ran  a  second  and  a  third  time,  but  Thialfi  met  with 
no  better  success. 

Utgard-Loki  then  asked  Thor  in  what  feats  he  would  choose 
to  give  proofs  of  that  prowess  for  which  he  was  so  famous.  Thor 
answered  that  he  would  try  a  drinking-match  with  any  one. 
Utgard-Loki  bade  his  cupbearer  bring  the  large  horn  which  his 
followers  were  obliged  to  empty  when  they  had  trespassed  in  any 
way  against  the  law  of  the  feast.  The  cupbearer  having  pre- 
sented it  to  Thor,  Utgard-Loki  said:  ** Whoever  is  a  good 
drinker  wall  empty  that  horn  at  a  single  draught,  though  most 
men  make  two  of  it,  but  the  most  puny  drinker  can  do  it  in 
three." 

Thor  looked  at  the  horn,  which  seemed  of  no  extraordinary 
size,  though  somewhat  long ;  however,  as  he  was  very  thirsty,  he 
set  it  to  his  lips,  and,  without  drawing  breath,  pulled  as  long 
and  as  deeply  as  he  could,  that  he  might  not  be  obliged  to  make 
a  second  draught  of  it ;  but  when  he  set  the  horn  down  and  looked 
in,  he  could  scarcely  perceive  that  the  liquor  was  diminished. 

After  taking  breath,  Thor  went  to  it  again  with  all  his  might, 
but  when  he  took  the  horn  from  his  mouth  it  seemed  to  him 
that  he  had  drank  rather  less  than  before,  although  the  horn 
could  now  be  carried  without  spilling. 

**  How  now,  Thor,"  said  Utgard-Loki ;  *'  thou  must  not  spare 
thyself;  if  thou  meanest  to  drain  the  horn  at  the  third  draught 
thou  must  pull  deeply  ;  and  I  must  needs  say  that  thou  wilt  not 
be  called  so  mighty  a  man  here  as  thou  art  at  home  if  thou  show- 
est  no  greater  prowess  in  other  feats  than  methinks  will  be  shown 
in  this." 

Thor,  full  of  wrath,  again  set  the  horn  to  his  lips,  ahd  did  his 
best  to  empty  it,  but  on  looking  in  found  the  liquor  was  only  a 
little  lower;  so  he  resolved  to  make  no  further  attempt,  but  gave 
back  the  horn  to  the  cupbearer. 

"I  now  see  plainly,"  said  Utgard-Loki,  *'that  thou  art  not 
quite  so  stout  as  we  thought  thee ;  but  wilt  thou  try  any  othcf 


430  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES. 

feat,  though  methinks  thou  are  not  likely  to  bear  any  prize  away 
with  thee  hence." 

**  What  new  trial  hast  thou  to  propose?  "  said  Thor. 

**We  have  a  very  trifling  game  here,"  answered  Utgard-Loki, 
**in  which  we  exercise  none  but  children.  It  consists  in  merely 
lifting  my  cat  from  the  ground  ;  nor  should  I  have  dared  to  men- 
tion such  a  feat  to  the  great  Thor  if  I  had  not  already  observed 
that  thou  art  by  no  means  what  we  took  thee  for. ' ' 

As  he  finished  speaking,  a  large  gray  cat  sprang  on  the  hall 
floor.  Thor  put  his  hand  under  the  cat's  belly  and  did  his  ut- 
most to  raise  him  from  the  floor ;  but  the  cat,  bending  his  back, 
had,  notwithstanding  all  Thor's  efforts,  only  one  of  his  feet  lifted 
up;  seeing  which,  Thor  made  no  further  attempt. 

**This  trial  has  turned  out,"  said  Utgard-Loki,  ''just  as  I 
imagined  it  would.  The  cat  is  large,  but  Thor  is  little  in  com- 
parison to  our  men. ' ' 

''Little  as  ye  call  me,"  answered  Thor,  "let  me  see  who 
among  you  will  come  hither,  now  I  am  in  wrath,  and  wrestle  with 


me." 


"I  see  no  one  here,"  said  Utgard-Loki,  looking  at  the  men 
sitting  on  the  benches,  "  who  would  not  think  it  beneath  him  to 
wrestle  with  thee ;  let  somebody,  however,  call  hither  that  old 
crone,  my  nurse  EUi,  and  let  Thor  wrestle  with  her,  if  he  will. 
She  has  thrown  to  the  ground  many  a  man  not  less  strong  than 
this  Thor  is." 

A  toothless  old  woman  then  entered  the  hall,  and  was  told  by 
Utgard-Loki  to  take  hold  of  Thor.  The  tale  is  shortly  told.  The 
more  Thor  tightened  his  hold  on  the  crone  the  firmer  she  stood. 
At  length,  after  a  very  violent  struggle,  Thor  began  to  lose  his  foot- 
ing, and  was  finally  brought  down  upon  one  knee.  Utgard-Loki 
then  told  them  to  desist,  adding  that  Thor  had  now  no  occasion 
to  ask  any  one  else  in  the  hall  to  wrestle  with  him,  and  it  was 
also  getting  late ;  so  he  showed  Thor  and  his  companions  to 
their  seats,  and  they  passed  the  night  there  in  good  cheer. 

The  next  morning  at  break  of  day  Thor  and  his  companions 
dressed  themselves  and  prepared  for  their  departure.  Utgard- 
Loki  ordered  a  table  to  be  set  for  them,  on  which  there  was  no 
lack  of  victuals  or  drink.  After  the  repast  Utgard-Loki  led 
them  to  the  gate  of  the  city,  and  on  parting  asked  Thor  how  he 


THURS  VISIT  TO  JOTUNHEIM.  43  1 

thought  his  journey  had  turned  out,  and  whether  he  had  met 
with  any  men  stronger  than  himself.  Thor  told  him  that  he 
could  not  deny  but  that  he  had  brought  great  shame  on  himself. 
**  And  what  grieves  me  most,"  he  added,  "  is  that  ye  will  call 
me  a  person  of  little  worth." 

**Nay,"  said  Utgard-Loki,  *Mt  behooves  me  to  tell  thee  the 
truth,  now  thou  art  out  of  the  city,  which  so  long  as  I  live  and 
have  my  way  thou  shalt  never  enter  again.  And,  by  my  troth> 
had  I  known  beforehand  that  thou  hadst  so  much  strength  in 
thee,  and  wouldst  have  brought  me  so  near  to  a  great  mishap,  I 
would  not  have  suffered  thee  to  enter  this  time.  Know,  then, 
that  I  have  all  along  deceived  thee  by  my  illusions ;  first  in  the 
forest,  where  I  tied  up  the  wallet  with  iron  wire  so  that  thou 
couldst  not  untie  it.  After  this  thou  gavest  me  three  blows  with 
thy  mallet ;  the  first,  though  the  least,  would  have  ended  my 
days  had  it  fallen  on  me,  but  I  slipped  aside  and  thy  blows  fell 
on  the  mountain,  where  thou  wilt  find  three  glens,  one  of  them 
remarkably  deep.  These  are  the  dints  made  by  thy  mallet.  I 
have  made  use  of  similar  illusions  in  the  contests  you  have  had 
with  my  followers.  In  the  first,  Loki,  like  hunger  itself,  de- 
voured all  that  was  set  before  him  ;  but  Logi  was  in  reality  noth- 
ing else  than  Fire,  and  therefore  consumed  not  only  the  meat, 
but  the  trough  which  held  it.  Hugi,  with  whom  Thialfi  con- 
tended in  running,  was  Thought,  and  it  was  impossible  for  Thialfi 
to  keep  pace  with  that.  When  thou  in  thy  turn  didst  attempt  to 
empty  the  horn,  thou  didst  perform,  by  my  troth,  a  deed  so  mar- 
vellous that,  had  I  not  seen  it  myself,  I  should  never  have  be- 
lieved it,  for  one  end  of  that  horn  reached  the  sea,  which 
thou  wast  not  aware  of;  but  when  thou  comest  to  the  shore  thou 
wilt  perceive  how  m.uch  the  sea  has  sunk  by  thy  draughts.  Thou 
didst  perform  a  feat  no  less  wonderful  by  lifting  up  the  cat ;  and 
to  tell  thee  the  truth,  when  we  saw  that  one  of  his  paws  was  off 
the  floor  we  were  all  of  us  terror-stricken,  for  what  thou  tookest 
for  a  cat  was  in  reality  the  Midgard  serpent  that  encompasseth 
the  earth,  and  he  was  so  stretched  by  thee  that  he  was  barely 
long  enough  to  enclose  it  between  his  head  and  tail.  Thy  wrest- 
ling with  Elli  was  also  a  most  astonishing  feat,  for  there  was 
never  yet  a  man,  nor  ever  will  be,  whom  Old  Age,  for  such  in 
tact  was  Elli,  will  not  sooner  or  later  lay  low.     But  now,  as  we

are  going  to  part,  let  me  tell  thee  that  it  will  be  better  for  both 
of  us  if  thou  never  come  near  me  again,  for  shouldst  thou  do  so, 
I  shall  again  defend  myself  by  other  illusions,  so  that  thou  will 
only  lose  thy  labor  and  get  no  fame  from  the  contest  with  me." 
On  hearing  these  words  Thor  in  a  rage  laid  hold  of  his  mallet 
and  would  have  launched  it  at  him,  but  Utgard-Loki  had  disap- 
peared, and  when  Thor  would  have  returned  to  the  city  to  de- 
stroy it  he  found  nothing  around  him  but  a  verdant  plain.

CHAPTER  XL. 

The  Death  of  Bal'dur— The  Elves— Runic  Letters- 
Skalds — Iceland. 

The  Death  of  Bal'dur. 

Bal'dur  the  Good,  having  been  tormented  with  terrible 
dreams,  indicating  that  his  life  was  in  peril,  told  them  to  the  as- 
sembled gods,  who  resolved  to  conjure  all  things  to  avert  from 
him  the  threatened  danger.  Then  Frigga,  the  wife  of  Odin, 
exacted  an  oath  from  fire  and  water,  from  iron  and  all  other 
metals,  from  stones,  trees,  diseases,  beasts,  birds,  poisons,  and 
creeping  things,  that  none  of  them  would  do  any  harm  to  Bal- 
dur.  Odin,  not  satisfied  with  all  this,  and  feeling  alarmed  for 
the  fate  of  his  son,  determined  to  consult  the  prophetess  Anger- 
bode,  a  giantess,  mother  of  Fenris,  Hela,  and  the  Midgard  ser- 
pent. She  was  dead,  and  Odin  was  forced  to  seek  her  in  Hela's 
dominions.  This  Descent  of  Odin  forms  the  subject  of  Gray's 
fine  ode,  beginning  : 

**  Uprose  the  king  of  men  with  speed 
And  saddled  straight  his  coal-black  steed." 

But  the  other  gods,  feeling  that  what  Frigga  had  done  was 
quite  sufficient,  amused  themselves  with  using  Baldur  as  a  mark, 
some  hurling  darts  at  him,  some  stones,  while  others  hewed  at 
him  with  their  swords  and  battle-axes ;  for  do  what  they  would, 
none  of  them  could  harm  him.  And  this  became  a  favorite 
pastime  with  them,  and  was  regarded  as  an  honor  shown  to  Bal- 
dur. But  when  Loki  beheld  the  scene  he  was  sorely  vexed  that 
Baldur  was  not  hurt.  Assuming,  therefore,  the  shape  of  a 
woman,  he  went  to  Fensalir,  the  mansion  of  Frigga.  That  god- 
dess, when  she  saw  the  pretended  woman,  inquired  of  her  if  she 
knew  what  the  gods  were  doing  at  their  meetings.  She  replied 
that  they  were  throwing  darts  and  stones  at  Baldur,  without 


4i4 


STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES. 


being  able  to  hurt  him.  '^Ay,"  said  Frigga,  ^'neither  stones, 
nor  sticks,  nor  anything  else  can  hurt  Baldur,  for  I  have  exacted 
an  oath  from  all  of  them."  **  What !"  exclaimed  the  woman. 
*' Have  all  things  sworn  to  spare  Baldur?"  ''AH  things,"  re- 
plied Frigga,  ''except  one  little  shrub  that  grows  on  the  eastern 
side  of  Valhalla,  and  is  called  Mistletoe,  and  which  I  thought 
too  young  and  feeble  to  crave  an  oath  from. ' ' 


V 


Frigga. 


As  soon  as  Loki  heard  this  he  went  away,  and  resuming  his 
natural  shape,  cut  off  the  mistletoe,  and  repaired  to  the  place 
where  the  gods  were  assembled.  There  he  found  Hodur  stand- 
ing apart,  without  partaking  of  the  sports,  on  account  of  his 
blindness,  and  going  up  to  him,  said,  "  Why  dost  thou  not  also 
throw  something  at  Baldur?  " 

*' Because  I  am  blind,"  answered  Hodur,  "and  see  not  where* 
Baldur  is,  and  have,  moreover,  nothing  to  throw." 


TKE  DEATH  OP  BALDUB.  435 

''Come,  then,"  said  Loki,  *'do  like  the  rest,  and  show  honor 
10  Baldur  by  throwing  this  twig  at  him,  and  I  will  direct  thy  arm 
towards  the  place  where  he  stands." 

Hodur  then  took  the  mistletoe,  and  under  the  guidance  of 
Loki  darted  it  at  Baldur,  who,  pierced  through  and  through, 
fell  down  lifeless.  Surely  never  was  there  witnessed,  eithei 
among  gods  or  men,  a  more  atrocious  deed  than  this.  When 
Baldur  fell  the  gods  were  struck  speechless  with  horror,  and  then 
they  looked  at  each  other,  and  all  were  of  one  mind  to  lay  hands  on 
him  who  had  done  the  deed,  but  they  were  obliged  to  delay  their 
vengeance  out  of  respect  for  the  sacred  place  where  they  were 
assembled.     They  gave  vent  to  their  grief  by  loud  lamentations. 

**  I  heard  a  voice  that  cried, 
*  Baldur  the  Beautiful 
Is  dead  !  is  dead  !* 
And  through  the  misty  air 
Passed  like  the  mournful  cry 
Of  sunward-sailing  cranes." — LoNGFELLow. 

When  the  gods  came  to  themselves,  Frigga  asked  who  among 
them  wished  to  gain  all  her  love  and  good-will.  '*For  this," 
said  she,  *'  shall  he  have  who  will  ride  to  Hel  and  offer  Hela  a 
ransom  if  she  will  let  Baldur  return  to  Asgard."  Whereupon 
Hermod,  surnamed  the  Nimble,  the  son  of  Odin,  offered  to  un- 
dertake the  journey.  Odin's  horse,  Sleipnir,  which  has  eight 
legs,  and  can  outrun  the  wind,  was  then  led  forth,  on  which 
Hermod  mounted  and  galloped  away  on  his  mission.  For  the 
space  of  nine  days  and  as  many  nights  he  rode  through  deep 
glens,  so  dark  that  he  could  not  discern  anything,  until  he  ar- 
rived at  the  river  Gyoll,  which  he  passed  over  on  a  bridge  cov- 
ered with  glittering  gold.  The  maiden  who  kept  the  bridge 
asked  him  his  name  and  lineage,  telling  him  that  the  day  before 
five  bands  of  dead  persons  had  ridden  over  the  bridge  and  did 
not  shake  it  as  much  as  he  alone.  **But,"  she  added,  "thou 
hast  not  death's  hue  on  thee ;  why  then  ridest  thou  here  on  the 
way  to  Hel?" 

**  I  ride  to  Hel,"  answered  Hermod,  **  to  seek  Baldur.  Hast 
thou  perchance  seen  him  pass  *his  way?" 

She  replied,  **  Baldur  hath  ridden  over  Gyoll's  bridge,  and 
yonder  lieth  the  way  he  took  to  the  abodes  of  death." 


436  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEBOES, 

Hermod  pursued  his  journey  until  be  came  to  the  barred  gatei 
of  Hel.  Here  he  alighted,  girthed  his  saddle  tighter,  and  re- 
mounting, clapped  both  spurs  to  his  horse,  who  cleared  the  gate 
by  a  tremendous  leap  without  touching  it.  Hermod  then  rode 
on  to  the  palace,  where  he  found  his  brother  Baldur  occupying 
the  most  distinguished  seat  in  the  hall,  and  passed  the  night  in 
his  company.  The  next  morning  he  besought  Hela  to  let  Bal- 
dur ride  home  with  him,  assuring  her  that  nothing  but  lamenta 
tions  were  to  be  heard  among  the  gods.  Hela  answered  that  il. 
should  now  be  tried  whether  Baldur  was  so  beloved  as  he  was 
said  to  be.  **If,  therefore,"  she  added,  **all  things  in  the 
world,  both  living  and  lifeless,  weep  for  him,  then  shall  he  re- 
turn to  life ;  but  if  any  one  thing  speak  against  him  or  refuse  to 
weep,  he  shall  be  kept  in  Hel." 

Hermod  then  rode  back  to  Asgard,  and  gave  an  account  of  all 
he  had  heard  and  witnessed. 

The  gods  upon  this  despatched  messengers  throughout  the 
world  to  beg  everything  to  weep,  in  order  that  Baldur  might  be 
delivered  from  Hel.  All  things  very  willingly  complied  with 
this  request,  both  men  and  every  other  living  being,  as  well  as 
earths,  and  stones,  and  trees,  and  metals,  just  as  we  have  all 
seen  these  things  weep  when  they  are  brought  from  a  cold  place 
into  a  hot  one.  As  the  messengers  were  returning,  they  found 
an  old  hag,  named  Thaukt,  sitting  in  a  cavern,  and  begged  her 
to  weep  Baldur  out  of  Hel.     But  she  answered : 

**  Thaukt  will  wail  with  dry  tears 
Baldur' s  bale-fire. 
Let  Hela  keep  her  own.** 

It  was  strongly  suspected  that  this  hag  was  no  other  than  Loki 
himself,  who  never  ceased  to  work  evil  among  gods  and  men. 
So  Baldur  was  prevented  from  coming  back  to  Asgard. 

The  Funeral  of  Baldur. 

The  gods  took  up  the  dead  body  and  bore  it  to  the  seashore, 
\fhere  stood  Baldur' s  ship  Hringham,  which  passed  for  the  largest 
in  the  world.  Baldur' s  dead  body  was  put  on  the  funeral  pile, 
on  board  the  ship,  and  his  wife  Nanna  was  so  struck  with  grief 
at  the  sight  that  she  broke  her  heart,  and  her  body  was  burned 
on  the  same  pile  with  her  husband's.     There  was  a  vast  con* 


THE  ELVES.  437 

course  of  various  kinds  of  people  at  Baldur's  obsequies.  First 
came  Odin,  accompanied  by  Frigga,  the  Valkyrior,  and  his 
ravens ;  then  Freyr,  in  his  car  drawn  by  Gullinbursti,  the  boar; 
Heimdall  rode  his  horse  GuUtopp,  and  Freya  drove  in  her  chariot 
drawn  by  cats.  There  were  also  a  great  many  Frost  giants  and 
giants  of  the  mountain  present.  Baldur's  horse  was  led  to  the 
pile,  fully  caparisoned,  and  consumed  in  the  same  flames  with 
his  master. 

But  Loki  did  not  escape  his  deserved  punishment.  When  he 
saw  how  angry  the  gods  were  he  fled  to  the  mountain,  and  there 
built  himself  a  hut  with  four  doors,  so  that  he  could  see  every 
approaching  danger.  He  invented  a  net  to  catch  the  fishes, 
such  as  fishermen  have  used  since  his  time.  But  Odin  found  out 
his  hiding-place,  and  the  gods  assembled  to  take  him.  He,  see- 
ing this,  changed  himself  into  a  salmon,  and  lay  hid  among  the 
stones  of  the  brook. 

**  Then  he  knew  that  the  noise  good  boded  him  naught ; 
He  knew  that  'twas  Thor  who  was  coming  ; 
He  changed  himself  straight  to  a  salmon-trout, 
And  leaped  in  a  fright  in  the  Gloramen."' — Oelenschlaeger. 

But  the  gods  took  his  net  and  dragged  the  brook,  and  Loki, 
finding  he  must  be  caught,  tried  to  leap  over  the  net ;  but  Thor 
caught  him  by  the  tail  and  compressed  it  so  that  salmons  ever 
since  have  had  that  part  remarkably  fine  and  thin.  They  bound 
him  with  chains  and  suspended  a  serpent  over  his  head,  whose 
venom  falls  upon  his  face  drop  by  drop.  His  wife  Siguna  sits 
by  his  side  and  catches  the  drops,  as  they  fall,  in  a  cup ;  but 
when  she  carries  it  away  to  empty  it  the  venom  falls  upon  Loki, 
which  makes  him  howl  with  horror  and  twist  his  body  about  so 
violently  that  the  whole  earth  shakes,  and  this  produces  what 
men  call  earthquakes. 

The  Elves. 

The  Eddas  mention  another  class  of  beings,  inferior  to  the 
gods,  but  still  possessed  of  great  power ;  these  were  called 
Elves,  The  white  spirits,  or  Elves  of  Light,  were  exceedingly 
fair,  more  brilliant  than  the  sun,  and  clad  in  garments  of  a  deli-

cate  and  transparent  texture.  They  loved  the  light,  were  kindly 
disposed  to  mankind,  and  generally  appeared  as  fair  and  lovely 
children.  Their  country  was  called  Alfheim,  and  was  the  domain 
of  Freyr,  the  god  of  the  sun,  in  whose  light  they  were  always 
sporting. 

The  black  or  night  Elves  were  a  different  kind  of  creatures. 
Ugly,  long-nosed  dwarfs,  of  a  dirty  brown  color,  they  appeared 
only  at  night,  for  they  avoided  the  sun  as  their  most  deadly 
enemy,  because  whenever  his  beams  fell  upon  any  of  them  they 
changed  them  immediately  into  stones.  Their  language  was  the 
echo  of  solitudes,  and  their  dwelling-places  subterranean  caves 
and  clefts.  They  were  supposed  to  have  come  into  existence  as 
maggots  produced  by  the  decaying  flesh  of  Ymir's  body,  and 
were  afterwards  endowed  by  the  gods  with  a  human  form  and 
great  understanding.  They  were  particularly  distinguished  for 
a  knowledge  of  the  mysterious  powers  of  nature,  and  for  the 
runes  which  they  carved  and  explained.  They  were  the  most 
skilful  artificers  of  all  created  beings,  and  worked  in  metals  and 
in  wood.  Among  their  most  noted  works  were  Thor's  hammer, 
and  the  ship  Skidbladnir,  which  they  gave  to  Freyr,  and  which 
was  so  large  that  it  could  contain  all  the  deities  with  their  war 
and  household  implements,  but  so  skilfully  was  it  wrought  that 
when  folded  together  it  could  be  put  into  a  side-pocket. 

Rag-na-rok',  the  Twilight  of  the  Gods. 

It  was  a  firm  belief  of  the  northern  nations  that  a  time  would 
come  when  all  the  visible  creation,  the  gods  of  Valhalla  and 
Niffleheim,  the  inhabitants  of  Jotunheim,  Alfheim,  and  Midgard, 
together  with  their  habitations,  would  be  destroyed.  The  fearful 
day  of  destruction  will  not,  however,  be  without  its  forerunners. 
First  will  come  a  triple  winter,  during  which  snow  will  fall  from 
the  four  corners  of  the  heavens,  the  frost  be  very  severe,  the 
wind  piercing,  the  weather  tempestuous,  and  the  sun  impart  no 
gladness.  Three  such  winters  will  pass  away  without  being  tem- 
pered by  a  single  summer.  Three  other  similar  winters  will  then 
follow,  during  which  war  and  discord  will  spread  over  the  uni- 
verse. The  earth  itself  will  be  frightened  and  begin  to  tremble, 
the  sea  leave  its  basin,  the  heavens  tear  asunder,  and  men  perish 
in  great  numbers,  and  the  eagles  of  the  air  feast  upon  their  stilj

quivering  bodies.  The  wolf  Fenris  will  now  break  his  bands, 
the  Midgard  serpent  rise  out  of  her  bed  in  the  sea,  and  Loki, 
released  from  his  bonds,  will  join  the  enemies  of  the  gods.  Amidst 
the  "-eneral  devastation  the  sons  of  Muspelheim  will  rush  forth 
under  their  leader  Surtur,  before  and  behind  whom  are  flames  and 
burning  fire.  Onward  they  ride  over  Bifrost,  the  rainbow  bridge, 
which  breaks  under  the  horses'  hoofs.  But  they,  disregarding 
its  fall,  direct  their  course  to  the  battle-field  called  Vigrid.  Thither 
also  repair  the  wolf  Fenris,  the  Midgard  serpent,  Loki,  with  all 
the  followers  of  Hela,  and  the  Frost  giants. 

Heimdall  now  stands  up  and  sounds  the  Giallar  horn  to  as- 
semble the  gods  and  heroes  for  the  contest.  The  gods  advance, 
led  on  by  Odin,  who  engages  the  wolf  Fenris,  but  falls  a  victim 
to  the  monster,  who  is,  however,  slain  by  Vidar,  Odin's  son. 
Thor  gains  great  renown  by  killing  the  Midgard  serpent,  but  re- 
coils and  falls  dead,  suffocated  with  the  venom  which  the  dying 
monster  vomits  over  him.  Loki  and  Heimdall  meet  and  fight 
till  they  are  both  slain.  The  gods  and  their  enemies  having 
fallen  in  battle,  Surtur,  who  has  killed  Freyr,  darts  fire  and 
and  flames  over  the  world,  and  the  whole  universe  is  burned  up. 
The  sun  becomes  dim,  the  earth  sinks  into  the  ocean,  the  stars 
fall  from  heaven,  and  time  is  no  more. 

After  this  Alfadur  (the  Almighty)  will  cause  a  new  heaven  and 
a  new  earth  to  arise  out  of  the  sea.  The  new  earth,  filled  with 
abundant  supplies,  will  spontaneously  produce  its  fruits  without 
labor  or  care.  Wickedness  and  misery  will  no  more  be  known, 
but  the  gods  and  men  will  live  happily  together. 

**Slie  sees  arise 
The  second  time 
From  tbe  sea,  the  earth 
Completely  green ; 
Cascades  do  fall, 
The  eagle  soars 
From  lofty  mounts. 
Pursues  its  prey ; 
All  ills  cease, 
Baldur  comes. 
The  heavenly  gods 
Together  dwell

440  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 

Runic  Letters. 

One  cannot  travel  far  in  Denmark,  Norway  or  Sweden  with* 
out  meeting  with  great  stones,  of  different  forms,  engraven  with 
characters  called  Runic,  which  appear  at  first  sight  very  different 
from  all  we  know.  The  letters  consist  almost  invariably  of 
straight  lines,  in  the  shape  of  little  sticks,  either  singly  or  put 
together.  Such  sticks  were  in  early  times  used  by  the  northern 
nations  for  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  future  events.  The  sticks 
were  shaken  up,  and  from  the  figures  that  they  formed  a  kind  of 
divination  was  derived. 

The  Runic  characters  were  of  various  kinds.  They  were 
chiefly  used  for  magical  purposes. 

**  Facing  to  the  northern  clime, 
Thrice  he  traced  the  Runic  rhyme ; 
Thrice  pronounced,  in  accents  dread, 
The  thrilling  verse  that  wakes  the  dead, 
Till  from  out  the  hollow  ground 
Slowly  breathed  a  sullen  sound." — Gray. 

The  noxious,  or,  as  they  called  them,  the  ^t'ffer  runes,  were  em- 
ployed to  bring  various  evils  on  their  enemies ;  the  favorable 
averted  misfortune.  Some  were  medicinal,  others  employed  to 
win  love,  etc.  In  later  times  they  were  frequently  used  for  in- 
scriptions, of  which  more  than  a  thousand  have  been  found. 
The  language  is  a  dialect  of  the  Gothic,  called  Norse,  still  in  use 
in  Iceland.  The  inscriptions  may  therefore  be  read  with  cer- 
tainty, but  hitherto  very  few  have  been  found  which  throw  the 
least  light  on  history.     They  are  mostly  epitaphs  on  tombstones. 

The    Skalds. 

The  Skalds  were  the  bards  and  poets  of  the  nation,  a  very 
important  class  of  men  in  all  communities  in  an  early  stage  of 
civilization.  They  are  the  depositaries  of  whatever  historic  lore 
there  is,  and  it  is  their  office  to  mingle  something  of  intellectual 
gratification  with  the  rude  feasts  of  the  warriors  by  rehearsing, 
with  such  accompaniments  of  poetry  and  music  as  their  skill  can 
afford,  the  exploits  of  their  heroes,  living  or  dead.  The  compo- 
sitions of  the  Skalds  were  called  Sagas,  many  of  which  have  come 
down  to  us,  and  contain  valuable  materials  of  history,  and  a

ffdthful  picture  of  the  state  of  society  at  the  time  to  which  they 
relate. 

Iceland. 

The  Eddas  and  Sagas  have  come  to  us  from  Iceland.  The 
following  gives  an  animated  account  of  the  region  where  the 
strange  stories  we  have  been  reading  had  their  origin.  Let  the 
reader  contrast  it  for  a  moment  with  Greece,  the  parent  of  clas- 
sical mythology : 

**  In  that  strange  island,  Iceland, — burst  up,  the  geologists  say, 
by  fire  from  the  bottom  of  the  sea,  a  wild  land  of  barrenness  and 
lava,  swallowed  many  months  of  every  year  in  black  tempests, 
yet  with  a  wild,  gleaming  beauty  in  summer  time,  towering  up 
there  stern  and  grim  in  the  North  ocean,  with  its  snow  yokuls 
(mountains),  roaring  geysers  (boiling  springs),  sulphur  pools, 
and  horrid  volcanic  chasms,  like  the  waste,  chaotic  battle-field  of 
Frost  and  Fire — where,  of  all  places,  we  least  looked  for  litera- 
ture or  written  memorials — the  record  of  these  things  was  written 
down.  On  the  seaboard  of  this  wild  land  is  a  rim  of  grassy 
country  where  cattle  can  subsist,  and  men  by  means  of  them 
and  of  what  the  sea  yields  ;  and  it  seems  they  were  poetic  men 
these,  men  who  had  deep  thoughts  in  them  and  uttered  musically 
their  thoughts.  Much  would  be  lost  had  Iceland  not  been  burst 
up  from  the  sea,  not  been  discovered  by  the  Northmen  !"^ 

Teutonic  Mythology. 

The  mythology  of  Germany  proper  is  identically  the  same  as 
that  of  the  Northland.  Odin  becomes  Wodan,  and  Frigga  is 
identical  with  Freya.  The  gods  become  less  warlike.  The 
legends  are  frostless,  and  the  hoarseness  of  winter  disappears 
from  the  voice  of  song ;  all  of  which  can  be  readily  understood 
from  the  wide  contrast  between  their  climatic  and  social  condi- 
tions.    One  of  the  best  known  myths  is  that  of  the  Lorelei. 

The  Lo're-lei'. 

This  was  a  siren  whose  name  became  the  terror  6f  the  Rhine. 
She  haunted  a  rock  that  still  bears  her  name  at  one  of  the  mosi

The  Ni'be-lun'gen-Lied. 
The  Ni'be-lun'gen-Lied  is  an  epic  written  in  German,  and 
based  upon  the  mythology  of  which  we  have  been   reading. 
Odin  Loki  and  Honir  see  an  otter  devouring  a  salmon.     They 
kill  it  and  take  its  skin  to  Rodmar,  who  recognizes  it  as  that  of 
his  son  Otter.     The  father  demands  gold  suiBcient  to  cover  it. 
Loki  catches  the  dwarf  Andwari  in  the  shape  of  a  pike,  who 
covers  the  entire  skin  with  gold,  save  a  single  hair.      In  order  to 
conceal  this  particular  hair  Loki  seizes  the  dwarfs  ring,  which 
possesses  the  magic  of  producing  gold.     The  dwarf  curses  the 
ransom,  and  his  malediction  runs  through  the  entire  song.     The 
father  is  slain  by  his  sons  Fafnir  and  Regin.     Fafnir  seizes  the 
possession,  and  as  a  snake  guards  it  on  Glistenheath.     Regin 
forges  the  sword  Gram,  and  with  a  friend,  Sigurd,  slays  Fafnir. 
Sigurd  learns  from  the  birds  that  his  life  is  in  danger,  so  he  slays 
Regin,  and  with  his  treasure  flees  to   Rhineland.      He  meets  on 
the  way  a  Valkyrie,  Brunhild,  whom  he  ardently  loves.      Subse- 
quently he  meets  the  King  of  Rhineland' s  daughter,  who  gives 
him  an  enchanted  drink,  by  which  he  forgets  Brunhild  and  mar- 
ries the  princess.     Gunnar,   the  king's  son,  then  attempts  to 
make  Brunhild  his  wife.     Her  castle  is  on  fire,  and  she  prom- 
ises to  marry  him  who  effects  her  rescue.     Gunnar  attempts  it 
and  fails ;  but  Sigurd,  mounted  on  his  enchanted  horse  Gram, 
dashes  through  the  flames  and  brings  her  to  safety.     His  form  in 
the  meanwhile  had  been  changed  into  that  of  Gunnar.     They 
all  return  to  the  palace,  Sigurd  assuming  his  former  self  after 
Gunnar  had  taken  BrunhiM  as  his  wife.     Brunhild,  maddened

by  jealousy,  induces  Guthorm,  another  son  of  the  King's,  to  slay 
Sigurd.  Twice  he  enters  his  bedchamber  and  finds  him  awake. 
The  third  time  he  gives  the  fatal  thrust.  Sigurd  awakes,  and, 
hurling  his  sword  at  the  assassin,  cuts  him  in  two.  Brunhild 
dies  on  the  burning  pyre  of  Sigurd.  Finally  the  princess  takes 
as  her  second  husband  Brunhild's  brother,  Atli,  King  of  the 
Huns.  Atli  invites  her  two  brothers,  Gunnar  and  Hogni,  to 
visit  him.  A  contest  ensues  over  the  treasure  which  these  broth- 
ers have  buried  beneath  the  Rhine.  Gunnar' s  life  is  promised 
on  condition  that  he  reveal  the  secret.  To  this  he  agrees,  after 
he  has  seen  his  brother  Hogni' s  heart.  The  heart  of  a  slave  is 
produced,  but  when  it  quakes  Gunnar  knows  it  is  not  that  of  his 
brother's.  Gunnar  still  remains  resolute.  His  hands  are  then 
tied,  and  he  is  thrown  into  a  den  of  serpents.  There  he  plays 
with  his  toes  upon  a  lyre  and  charms  all  the  reptiles  save  one, 
an  adder,  by  which  he  is  stung  to  death.  The  Princess,  in  re- 
venge, slays  the  children  she  has  borne  to  Atli,  and  finally  the 
King  himself.  She  then  throws  herself  into  the  sea,  and  is  drifted 
by  the  waves  to  other  scenes  and  kingdoms.  This  is  but  an  out- 
line of  the  Norse  version  of  the  poem.  It  probably  dates  back 
to  the  twelfth  century.*

CHAPTER  XLI. 

The  Dru'ids— I-o'na, 

Dru'ids. 

The  Dru'ids  were  the  priests  or  ministers  of  religion  among 
the  ancient  Celtic  nations  in  Gaul,  Britain,  and  Germany.  Our 
information  respecting  them  is  borrowed  from  notices  in  the 
Greek  and  Roman  writers,  compared  with  the  remains  of  Welsh 
and  Gaelic  poetry  still  extant. 

They  were  organized  into  a  triad,  consisting  of  Bards,  Vates 
or  prophets,  and  Priests.  The  latter  were  the  dominant  power. 
They  lived  in  the  forests,  and  guarded  in  secret  the  mysteries  of 
their  religion. 

The  Druids  combined  the  functions  of  the  priest,  the  magis- 
trate, the  scholar,  and  the  physician.  They  stood  to  the  people 
of  the  Celtic  tribes  in  a  relation  closely  analogous  to  that  in 
which  the  Brahmans  of  India,  the  Magi  of  Persia,  and  the  priests 
of  the  Egyptians  stood  to  the  people  respectively  by  whom  they 
were  revered. 

The  Druids  taught  the  existence  of  one  god,  to  whom  they 
gave  a  name  *'Be'  al,"  which  Celtic  antiquaries  tell  us  means 
**the  life  of  everything,"  or  **the  source  of  all  beings,"  and 
which  seems  to  have  affinity  with  the  Phoenician  Baal.  What 
renders  this  affinity  more  striking  is  that  the  Druids  as  well  as  the 
Phoenicians  identified  this,  their  supreme  deity,  with  the  Sun. 
Fire  was  regarded  as  a  symbol  of  the  divinity.  The  Latin  writers 
assert  that  the  Druids  also  worshipped  numerous  inferior  gods. 

They  used  no  images  to  represent  the  object  of  their  worship, 
nor  did  they  meet  in  temples  or  buildings  of  any  kind  for  the 
performance  of  their  sacred  rites.  A  circle  of  stones  (each  stone 
generally  of  vast  size)  enclosing  an  area  of  from  twenty  feet  to 
thirty  yards  in  diameter,  constituted  their  sacred  place.     The 

most  celebrated  of  these  now  remaining  is  Stonehenge,  on  Salis- 
bury Plain,  England.

STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 


These  sacred  circles  were  generally  situated  near  some  stream, 
or  under  the  shadow  of  a  grove  or  wide -spreading  oak.  In  the 
centre  of  the  circle  stood  the  Cromlech  or  altar,  which  was  a 
large  stone,  placed  in  the  manner  of  a  table  upon  other  stones 
set  up  on  end.  The  Druids  had  also  their  high  places,  which 
were  large  stones  or  piles  of  stones  on  the  summits  of  hills. 
These  were  called  Cairns,  and  were  used  in  the  worship  of  the 
deity  under  the  symbol  of  the  sun. 


Stonehenge. 


« 


—  midst  the  eternal  clifTs,  whose  strength  defied 
The  crested  Roman  in  his  hour  of  pride ; 
And  where  the  Druid's  ancient  cromlech  frowned, 
And  the  oaks  breathed  mysterious  murmurs  round, 
There  thronged  the  inspired  of  yore !  on  plain  or  height, 
In  the  sun's  face,  beneath  the  eye  of  light, 
And  baring  unto  heaven  each  noble  head, 
Stood  in  the  circle,  where  none  else  might  tread." 

— Mrs.  Hf:mans. 


That  the  Druids  offered  sacrifices  to  their  deity  there  can  be 
no  doubt.  But  there  is  some  uncertainty  as  to  what  they  offered, 
and  of  the  ceremonies  connected  with  their  religious  services  we 
know  almost  nothing.     The  classical  Roman  writers  affirm  that 


DRUTDSL  447 

they  offered  on  great  occasions  human  sacrifices  ;  as,  for  success 
in  war  or  for  relief  from  dangerous  diseases.  Caesar  has  given  a 
detailed  account  of  the  manner  in  which  this  was  done.  *'  They 
have  images  of  immense  size,  the  limbs  of  which  are  framed  with 
twisted  twigs  and  filled  with  living  persons.  These  being  set  on 
fire,  those  within  are  encompassed  by  the  flames."  Many  at- 
tempts have  been  made  by  Celtic  writers  to  shake  the  testimony 
of  the  Roman  historians  to  this  fact,  but  without  success. 

The  Druids  observed  two  festivals  in  each  year.  The  former 
took  place  in  the  beginning  of  May,  and  was  called  Beltane,  or 
•*fire  of  God."  On  this  occasion  a  large  fire  was  kindled  on 
some  elevated  spot,  in  honor  of  the  sun,  whose  returning  benefi- 
cence they  thus  welcomed  after  the  gloom  and  desolation  of 
winter.  Of  this  custom  a  trace  remains  in  the  name  given  to 
Whitsunday  in  parts  of  Scotland  to  this  day.  Sir  Walter  Scott 
uses  the  word  in  the  Boat  Song  in  the  Lady  of  the  Lake  ; — 

**  Ours  is  no  sapling,  chance  sown  by  the  fountain. 
Blooming  at  Beltane  in  winter  to  fade,"  etc. 

The  other  great  festival  of  the  Druids  was  called  "Samh'in," 
or  **  fire  of  peace,"  and  was  held  on  Hallow-eve,  which  still  re- 
tains this  designation  in  the  Highlands  of  Scotland.  On  this 
occasion  the  Druids  assembled  in  solemn  conclave,  in  the  most 
central  part  of  the  district,  to  discharge  the  judicial  functions  of 
their  order.  All  questions,  whether  public  or  private,  all  crimes 
against  person  or  property,  were  at  this  time  brought  before  them 
for  adjudication.  With  these  judicial  acts  were  combined  cer- 
tain superstitious  usages,  especially  the  kindling  of  the  sacred 
fire,  from  which  all  the  fires  in  the  district,  which  had  been  be- 
forehand scrupulously  extinguished,  might  be  relighted.  This 
usage  of  kindling  fires  on  Hallow-eve  lingered  in  the  British 
islands  long  after  the  establishment  of  Christianity. 

Besides  these  two  great  annual  festivals  the  Druids  were  in  the 
habit  of  observing  the  full  moon,  and  especially  the  sixth  day  of 
the  moon.  On  the  latter  they  sought  the  Mistletoe,  which  grew 
on  their  favorite  oaks,  and  to  which,  as  well  as  to  the  oak  itself, 
they  ascribed  a  peculiar  virtue  and  sacredness.  The  discovery 
of  it  was  an  occasion  of  rejoicing  and  solemn  worship.  **  They 
call  it,"  says  Pliny,   **by  a  word  in  their  language  which  means 


44^  STORIES  OF  OODS  AND  HEROES 

*  heal-all,*  and  having  made  solemn  preparation  for  feasting  and 
sacrifice  under  the  tree,  they  drive  thither  two  milk-white  bulls, 
whose  horns  are  then  for  the  first  time  bound.  The  priest  then, 
robed  in  white,  ascends  the  tree  and  cuts  oflf  the  mistletoe  with 
a  golden  sickle.  It  is  caught  in  a  white  mantle,  after  which  they 
proceed  to  slay  the  victims,  at  the  same  time  praying  that  God' 
would  render  his  gift  prosperous  to  those  to  whom  he  had  given 
it.**  They  drink  the  water  in  which  it  has  been  infused,  and 
think  it  a  remedy  for  all  diseases.  The  mistletoe  is  a  parasitic 
plant,  and  is  not  always,  nor  often,  found  on  the  oaks,  so  that 
when  it  is  found  it  is  the  more  precious. 

The  oak  is  supposed  to  have  represented  their  idea  of  the 
Supreme  Being,  and  the  mistletoe,  when  found  clinging  to  it, 
signified  man's  dependence  upon  Him. 

The  most  remarkable  of  all  their  superstitions  was  the  snake's 
eggf  which  was  believed  to  be  produced  from  the  saliva  oozing 
from  the  mouths  of  serpents  when  knotted  together.  They  were 
said  to  toss  it  up  into  the  air  as  soon  as  formed.  The  object  was 
to  secure  the  egg  before  it  fell.  Then  the  fortunate  Druid  would 
mount  his  horse  and  gallop  away,  pursued  by  the  serpents,  until 
he  had  put  a  running  stream  between  himself  and  them.  Like 
the  Romans,  they  consulted  the  flight  of  birds  and  the  entrails 
of  sacrificed  animals  in  their  divinations. 

Associated  with  the  Druidical  priesthood  were  the  Druidesses, 
an  order  of  prophetic  women.  They  seem  to  have  been  a  de- 
luded class,  who  mistook  their  frantic  orgies  for  worship. 

The  Druids  were  the  teachers  of  morality  as  well  as  of  religion. 
Of  their  ethical  teaching  a  valuable  specimen  is  preserved  in  the 
Triads  of  the  Welsh  Bards,  and  from  this  we  may  gather  that 
their  views  of  moral  rectitude  were  on  the  whole  just,  and  that 
they  held  and  inculcated  many  very  noble  and  valuable  princi- 
ples of  conduct.  They  were  also  the  men  of  science  and  learn- 
ing of  their  age  and  people.  Whether  they  were  acquainted 
with  letters  or  not  has  been  disputed,  though  the  probability  is 
strong  that  they  were  to  some  extent.  But  it  is  certain  that  they 
committed  nothing  of  their  doctrine,  their  history  or  their 
poetry  to  writing.  Their  teaching  was  oral,  and  their  literature 
(if  such  a  word  may  be  used  in  such  a  case)  was  preserved  solely 
by  tradition.     But  /he  Roman  writers  admit  that  **  they  paid 


DRUIDS,

much  attention  to  the  order  and  laws  of  nature,  and  investigated 
and  taught  to  the  youth  under  their  charge  many  things  concern- 
ing the  stars  and  their  motions,  the  size  of  the  world  and  the 
lands,  and  concerning  the  might  and  power  of  the  immortal 
gods.** 

Their  history  consisted  in  traditional  tales,  in  which  the 
heroic  deeds  of  their  forefathers  were  celebrated.  These  were 
apparently  in  verse,  and  thus  constituted  part  of  the  poetry  as 
well  as  the  history  of  the  Druids.     In  the  poems  of  Ossian  we

have,  if  not  the  actual  productions  of  Druidical  times,  what  may 
be  considered  faithful  representations  of  the  songs  of  the  Bards. 

The  Bards  were  an  essential  part  of  the  Druidical  hierarchy. 
They  were  supposed  to  be  endowed  with  powers  equal  to  inspira- 
tion. They  were  the  oral  historians  of  all  past  transactions,  pub- 
lic and  private.  Before  the  face  of  the  Roman  invader  they 
passed  away. 

"  My  harp  hangs  on  a  blasted  branch.  The  sound  of  its 
strings  is  mournful.  There  is  a  murmur  on  the  heath  1  The 
stormy  winds  abate  1     I  hear  the  voice  of  Fingal,   *  Come,  Os-

sian,  come  away,'  he  says.  *Fingal  has  received  his  fame.  We 
passed  away  hke  flames  that  have  shone  for  a  season.  Though 
the  plains  of  our  battles  are  dark  and  silent,  our  fame  is  in  the 
four  gray  stones.  The  harp  has  been  strung  in  Selma.  Come, 
Ossian,  come  away.  Fly  with  thy  fathers  upon  the  clouds.' 
Beside  the  stone  of  Mora  I  shall  fall  asleep.  The  winds 
whistling  in  my  gray  hairs  shall  not  awaken  me.  Depart 
on  thy  wings,  O  wind.  Thou  canst  not  disturb  the  rest  of  the 
bard. 

*'The  night  is  long,  but  his  eyes  are  heavy.  Depart  thou 
rustling  blast.  But  why  art  thou  sadof  Fingal?  Why  grows 
the  cloud  of  thy  soul  ?  The  chiefs  of  other  times  are  forgotten. 
They  have  gone  without  their  fame.  The  sons  of  future  years 
shall  pass  away.  Another  race  shall  arise.  The  people  are  like 
the  waves  of  the  ocean  ;  like  the  leaves  of  woody  Morven,  they 
pass  away  in  the  rustling  blast,  and  other  leaves  lift  their  heads 
on  high.  Shalt  thou  then  remain,  thou  aged  bard,  when  the 
mighty  have  failed  ?  But  my  fame  shall  remain,  and  grow  like 
the  oak  of  Morven,  which  lifts  its  broad  head  to  the  storm,  and 
rejoices  in  the  course  of  the  wind."^ 

Pennant  gives  a  minute  account  of  the  Eisteddfodds  or  ses- 
sions of  the  Bards  and  Minstrels,  which  were  held  in  Wales  for 
many  centuries,  long  after  the  Druidical  priesthood  in  its  othei 
departments  became  extinct.  At  these  meetings  none  but  bards 
of  merit  were  suffered  to  rehearse  their  pieces,  and  minstrels 
of  skill  to  perform.  Judges  were  appointed  to  decide  on  their 
respective  abilities,  and  suitable  degrees  were  conferred.  In 
the  earlier  period  the  judges  were  appointed  by  the  Welsh 
princes,  and  after  the  conquest  of  Wales  by  commission  from 
the  kings  of  England.  Yet  the  tradition  is  that  Edward  I.,  in 
revenge  for  the  influence  of  the  Bards  in  animating-  the  resist- 
ance of  the  people  to  his  sway,  persecuted  them  with  great 
cruelty.  This  tradition  has  furnished  the  poet  Gray  with  the 
subject  of  his  celebrated  ode,  The  Bard. 

The  Druidical  system  was  at  its  height  at  the  time  of  the  Ro- 
man invasion  under  Julius  Caesar.  Against  the  Druids,  as  their 
chief  enemies,  these  conquerors  of  the  world  directed  their  un- 
sparing  fury.     The  Druids,  harassed  at  all  points  on  the  main

land,  retreated  to  Anglesey  and  lona,  where  for  a  season  they 
found  shelter  and  continued  their  now-dishonored  rites. 

The  Druids  retained  their  predominance  in  lona  and  over  the 
avijacent  islands  and  mainland  until  they  were  supplanted  and 
their  superstitions  overturned  by  the  arrival  of  St.  Columba,  the 
apostle  of  the  Highlands,  by  whom  the  inhabitants  of  that  dis- 
trict were  first  led  to  profess  Christianity. 

I-o'na. 

One  of  the  smallest  of  the  British  Isles,  situated  near  a  rugged 
and  barren  coast,  surrounded  by  dangerous  seas,  and  possessing 
no  sources  of  internal  wealth,  I -o'na  has  obtained  an  imperishable 
place  in  history  as  the  seat  of  civilization  and  religion  at  a  time 
when  the  darkness  of  heathenism  hung  over  almost  the  whole  of 
Northern  Europe.  lona  or  Icolmkill  is  situated  at  the  extremity 
of  the  island  of  Mull,  from  which  it  is  separated  by  a  strait  of 
half  a  mile  in  breadth,  its  distance  from  the  mainland  of  Scot- 
land being  thirty-six  miles. 

Columba  was  a  native  of  Ireland,  and  connected  by  birth  with 
the  princes  of  the  land.  Ireland  was  at  that  time  a  land  of  gos- 
pel light,  while  the  western  and  northern  parts  of  Scotland  were 
still  immersed  in  the  darkness  of  heathenism.  Columba  with 
twelve  friends  landed  on  the  island  of  lona  in  the  year  of  our 
Lord,  563,  having  made  the  passage  in  a  wicker  boat  covered 
with  hides.  The  Druids  who  occupied  the  island  endeavored  to 
prevent  his  settling  there,  and  the  savage  nations  on  the  adjoin- 
ing shores  incommoded  him  with  their  hostility,  and  on  several 
occasions  endangered  his  life  by  their  attacks.  Yet  by  his  per- 
severance and  zeal  he  surmounted  all  opposition,  procured  from 
the  king  a  gift  of  the  island,  and  established  there  a  monastery 
3f  which  he  was  the  abbot.  He  was  unwearied  in  his  labors  to 
disseminate  a  knowledge  of  the  Scriptures  throughout  the  High- 
lands and  Islands  of  Scotland,  and  such  was  the  reverence  paid 
him  that  the  entire  province  became  subject  to  him  and  his  suc- 
cessors. The  Pictish  monarch  was  so  impressed  with  a  sense  of 
his  wisdom  and  worth  that  he  held  him  in  the  highest  honor,  and 
the  neighboring  chiefs  and  princes  sought  his  counsel  and  availed 
themselves  of  his  judgment  in  settling  their  disputes. 

When  Columba  landed  on  Zona  he  was  attended  by  twelve 


452  STORIES  OF  GODS  AND  HEROES, 

followers,  whom  he  had  formed  into  a  religious  body,  of  which 
he  was  the  head.  To  these,  as  occasion  required,  others  were 
from  time  to  time  added,  so  that  the  original  number  was  always 
kept  up.  The  name  by  which  those  who  submitted  to  the  rule 
were  known  was  that  of  Culdees,  probably  from  the  Latin 
"cultores  Dei" — worshippers  of  God.  They  were  a  body  of 
religious  persons  associated  together  for  the  purpose  of  aiding 
each  other  in  the  common  work  of  preaching  the  gospel  and 
teaching  youth,  as  well  as  maintaining  in  themselves  the  fervor 
of  devotion  by  united  exercises  of  worship. 

lona,  from  its  position  in  the  western  seas,  was  exposed  to  the 
assaults  of  the  Norwegian  and  Danish  rovers  by  whom  those  seas 
were  infested,  and  by  them  it  was  repeatedly  pillaged,  its  dwell- 
ings burned,  and  its  peaceful  inhabitants  put  to  the  sword.  These 
unfavorable  circumstances  led  to  its  gradual  decline,  which  was 
expedited  by  the  subversion  of  the  Culdees  throughout  Scotland. 

lona  is  now  chiefly  resorted  to  by  travellers  on  account  of  the 
numerous  ecclesiastical  and  sepulchral  remains  which  are  found 
upon  it.  The  principal  of  these  are  the  Cathedral  or  Abbey 
Church,  and  the  Chapel  of  the  Nunnery.  Besides  these  remains 
of  ecclesiastical  antiquity  there  are  some  of  an  earlier  date,  and 
pointing  to  the  existence  on  the  island  of  forms  of  worship  and 
belief  different  from  those  of  Christianity.  These  are  the  circu- 
lar cairns  which  are  found  in  various  parts,  and  which  seem  to 
have  been  of  Druidical  origin.  It  is  in  reference  to  all  these 
remains  of  ancient  religion  that  Johnson  exclaims,  **That  man 
is  little  to  be  envied  whose  patriotism  would  not  gain  force  upon 
the  plains  of  Marathon,  or  whose  piety  would  not  grow  warmei 
amid  the  ruins  of  lona.** 

'*  Nature  herself,  it  seemed,  would  raise 
A  minister  to  her  Maker's  praise  I 
Not  for  a  meaner  use  ascend 
Her  columns,  or  her  arches  bend  ; 
Nor  of  a  theme  less  solemn  tells 
That  mighty  surge  that  elibs  and  swellSi 
And  still  between  each  awful  pause, 
From  the  high  vault  an  answer  draws, 
In  varied  tone,  prolonged  and  high, 
That  mocks  the  organ' s  melody  ; 
Nor  doth  its  entrance  front  in  vain

To  old  Iona*s  holy  fane. 

That  Nature's  voice  might  seem  to  say, 

Well  hast  thou  done,  frail  child  of  clay  I 

Thy  humble  powers  that  stately  shrine 

Tasked  high  and  hard— but  witness  mine  !" — ScOTT, 

This  little  isle,  with  its  crosses  and  cairns,  emblems  of  an 
ancient  Christianity  and  more  ancient  paganism,  remained  for 
centuries  as  one  of  the  most  sacred  spots  on  earth.  An  old 
prophecy  declared  that  seven  years  before  the  end  of  the  world 
a  second  deluge  would  destroy  the  earth,  all  but  lona,  which 
would  float  like  an  ark  upon  the  waters.  This  tradition  made  it 
the  favorite  cemetery  for  the  nobility  and  kings.  Forty-eight 
Scottish,  four  Irish  and  eight  Norwegian  monarchs  are  said  to 
have  found  sepulture  in  its  hallowed  soil.  And  here,  by  the 
grave  of  Macbeth,  surrounded  by  those  mysterious  symbols  in 
whose  presence  the  lips  of  history  are  forever  silent,  we  con- 
clude the  Stories  of  Gods  and  Heroes.

A-'bae,  an  mcient  town  of  Phocis, 
on  the  b'  iiularics  of  Boeotia  ;  cele- 
brated for  an  ancient  temple  and 
oracle  of  Apollo,  who  hence  derived 
the  surn.^uie  of  Abaeas. 

Ab'a-ris,  a  Hyperborean  priest  of 
Apollo,  came  from  the  conntry 
about  the  Caucasus  to  Greece,  while 
his  native  laud  was  visited  by  a 
plague.  His  history  is  entirely 
mythical;  he  is  said  to  have  taken 
no  earthly  food,  and  to  have  ridden 
on  an  arrow,  the  gift  of  Apollo, 
through  the  air. 

Ab-syr'tus,  170. 

A-by'dos,  a  town  on  the  Hellespont, 
nearly  opposite  to  Sestos,  but  a  lit- 
tle lower  down  the  stream.  The 
bridge  of  boats  which  Xerxes  con- 
structed over  the  Hellespont,  B.C. 
480,  commenced  a  little  higher  up 
than  Abydos,  and  touched  the  Euro- 
pean shore  between  Sestos  and 
Madytus,  128,  361,  367,  368. 

Ab'y-la,  Mount,  or  Columna,  a 
mountain  in  Mauretauia  Tingitaua, 
forming  the  E.  extremity  of  the  S. 
or  African  coast.  This  and  M.  Calpe 
(Gibraltar),  opposite  to  it,  on  the 
Spanish  coast,  were  called  the  Col- 
umns of  Hercules,  from  the  fable  tliat 
they  were  originally  one  mountain, 
torn  asunder  by  Hercules,  180. 

Ac'a-de'mi-a,  a  piece  of  land  on  the 
Cephissus,  Athens,  originally  be- 
longing to  a  hero  Academus,  and 
subsequently  a  gymnasium,  adorn- 
ed by  Cimon  with  plane  and  olive 
plantations,  statues,  and  other 
works  of  art.  Here  taught  Plato, 
who  possessed  a  piece  of  land  in  the 
neighborhood,  and  after  him  his 
followers,  who  were  hence  called  the 
Academici,  or  Academic  philoso- 
phers. Cicero  gave  the  name  of 
Academia  to  his  villa  near  Puteoli, 
where  he  wrote  his  "Qufestioues 
Academicfe." 

A-ces'tes,  son  of  a  Trojan  woman,  of 
the  name  of  Egesta  or  Segesta,  who 
was  sent  by  her  father  to  Sicily, 


that  she  might  not  be  devoured  by 
the  monsters  which  infested  the 
territory  of  Troy,  325,  348. 

A-ce'tes,  205,  208. 

A-cha'tes,  the  friend  and  companion 
of  iEucas,  345. 

AcH-E-Lo'us,  the  largest  river  in 
Greece.  The  god  of  this  river  is 
described  as  the  son  of  Oceanus  and 
Tethys,  and  as  the  eldest  of  his  3000 
brothers.  He  fought  with  Hercules 
but  was  conquered.  He  then  took 
the  form  of  a  bull,  but  was  again 
overcome  by  Hercules,  who  de- 
prived him  of  one  of  his  horns, 
which,  however,  he  recovered  by 
giving  up  the  horn  of  Amalthea. 
The  Naiades  changed  the  horn 
which  Hercules  took  from  Ache- 
lous  into  the  horn  of  plenty,  224- 
226. 

Ach'e-ron,  the  name  of  several  riv- 
ers, all  of  which  were,  at  least  at 
one  time,  believed  to  be  connected 
with  the  lower  world.  (1)  A  river 
in  Thesprotia,  in  Epirus,  which 
flows  through  the  lake  Acherusia 
into  the  Ionian  sea.  (2)  A  river  in 
southern  Italy,  in  Bruttii,  on  which 
Alexander  of  Epirus  perished.  (3) 
Theriver  of  the  lower  world  round 
which  the  shades  hover,  and  into 
which  the  Pyriphlegethon  and 
Cocytus  flow.  In  late  writers  the 
name  of  Acheron  is  used  to  desig- 
nate the  whole  of  the  lower  world. 

A-chil'les,  the  hero  of  the  Iliad,  son 
of  Peleus,  king  of  the  Myrmidones, 
and  of  the  Nereid  Thetis,  116, 171, 
219,  258,  263,  264,  265,  266,  267,  269,

A'cis,  259-261. 

A-con'ti-us,  a  beautiful  youth,  who, 
having  come  to  Delos  to  celebrate 
the  festival  of  Diana,  fell  in  love 
with  Cydippe,  the  daughter  of  a 
noble  Athenian.  While  she  was 
sitting  before  the  temple  of  Diana, 
he  threw  to  her  an  apple  upoa 
which  he  had  written   the  wo^da 

(461)

INDEX  AND  DICTIONARY, 


"  I  swear  by  the  sanctuary  of  Diana 
to  marry  Acontius."  The  nurse 
took  up  the  apple  and  handed  it  to 
Cydippe,  who  read  aloud  what  was 
written  upon  it,  and  then  threw  the 
apple  away.  But  the  goddess  liad 
heard  lier  vow ;  and  the  repeated 
illness  of  the  maiden,  when  she  was 
about  to  marry  another  man,  at 
length  compelled  her  father  to  give 
her  in  marriage  to  Acontius,  150. 

A-CRis'i-us,  son  of  Abas,  king  of  Ar- 
gos,  grandson  of  Lynceus,  and  great- 
grandson  of  Dauaus,  142,  150. 

A-CROP'O-LIS,  190. 

Ac-T^'oN,  a  celebrated  huntsman,  son

A-do'nis,  a  youth,  beloved  by  Aphro- 
dite (Venus),  but  he  died  of  a  wound 
which  he  received  from  a  boar  dur- 
ing the  chase.  The  grief  of  the  god- 
dess at  his  death  was  so  great  that 
the  gods  of  the  lower  world  allowed 
him  to  spend  six  months  of  every 
year  with  Aphrodite  upon  the 
earth.  The  worship  of  Adonis  ap- 
pears bo  have  had  reference  to  the 
death  of  nature  in  winter,  and  to 
its  revival  in  spring;  hence  Adonis 
spends  six  months  in  the  lower  and 
six  months  in  the  upper  world,  79, 
83,  84.  85. 

A-dras'tus,  230. 

^'a-cus,  son  of  Zeus  (.Tupiter)  and 
yEgina,  a  daughter  of  the  river-god 
Asopus.  Some  traditions  related 
that  at  the  birth  of  ^acus  .Egina 
was  not  yet  inhabited,  and  that 
Zeus  cliansed  the  ants  of  the  island 
into  men  (Myrmidones),  over  whona 
^acus  ruled.  ^acus  was  re- 
nowned in  all  Greece  for  his  justice 
and  piety,  and  after  his  death  be- 
came one  of  the  three  judges  in 
Hades,  116.

^-e'tes,  or  ^ETA,  son  of  Helios 
(the  Sun)  and  Perseis.  and  father

king  of  Colchis  at  the  time  when 
Phrixus  brought  thither  the  golden 
fleece,  161,  162,  161,  166,  170.

iE-oi'NA,  a  rocky  island  in  the  mid- 
dle of  theSaronic  gulf,  said  to  have 
obtained  its  name  from  iEgina,  the 


daughter  of  the  river-god  Asopua, 
who  there  bore  him  a  son,  ^acus 
As  the  island  had  then  no  inhabit 
ants,  Zeus  (Jupiter)  changed  the 
ants  into  men  (Myrmidones),  ovei 
whom  iEacus  ruled,  116. 

vE'gir,  the  Norse  god  who  presides 
over  the  stormy  sea.  He  also  en- 
tertains the  gods  at  harvest-time, 
and  brews  their  ale.

.^-ne'as,  the  Trojan  hero,  ^neas 
was  the  sou  of  Anchises  and  Aphro- 
dite (Venus),  and  was  born  on 
Mount  Ida.  At  first  he  took  no 
part  in  the  Trojan  war;  and  it  was 
not  till  Achilles  attacked  him  on 
Mount  Ida,  and  drove  away  his 
flocks,  that  he  led  his  Dardanians 
against  the  Greeks.  Henceforth 
^ueas  and  Hector  appear  as  the 
great  bulwarks  of  the  Trojans 
against  the  Greeks,  and  ^ueas  is 
beloved  by  gods  and  men.  On  morQ 
than  one  occasion  he  is  saved  in 
battle  by  the  gods.  He  was  finally 
slain,  and  his  body,  not  having  been 
found,  was  supposed  to  have  been 
carried  up  to  heaven.  The  Latins 
erected  a  monument  to  him,  with 
the  inscription  To  the  father  and 
native  god.  The  story  of  the  de- 
scent of  the  Eomans  from  the  Tro- 
jans through  ^neas  was  believed 
at  an  early  period,  but  rests  on  no 
historical  foundation,  77,  267,  276,

^E'o-Lus,  son  of  Hellen  and  the 
nymph  Orseis.  Son  of  Hippotes, 
or,  according  to  others,  of  Poseidon 
(Neptune)  and  Arne,  a  descendant 
ol  the  previous  yEolus.  He  is  rep- 
resented in  Homer  as  the  happy 
ruler  of  the  ^olian  islands,  to 
whom  Zeus  had  given  dominion

Ag'a-ME'des,  brother  of  Trophonius. 
Agamedes  and  Trophonius  distin- 
guished themselves  as  architects. 
They  built  a  temple  of  Apollo  at 
Delphi,  and  a  treasury  of  Hyrieus, 
king  of  Hyria.  In  the  construction 
of  the  latter,  they  contrived  to  place 
a  stone  in  such  a  manner  that  it 
could  be  taken  away  outside  with- 
out anybody  perceiving  it.  A  tra- 
dition mentioned  by  Cicero  states 
that  Agamedes  and  Trophonius, 
after  building  the  temple  Apollo 
at  Delphi,  prayed  to  the  god 
to  grant  them,  in  reward  for  their 
labor,  what  was  best  for  men.  The 
god  promised  to  do  so  on  a  certain 
day,  and  when  the  day  came  the 
two  brothers  died,  373. 

...g'a-mem'nox,  son  of  Plisthenis  and 
grandson  of  Atreus,  king  of  My- 
cenae. When  Helen,  the  wife  of 
Menelaus,  was  carried  off  by  Paris, 
and  the  Greek  chiefs  resolved  to  re- 
cover her  by  force  of  arms,  Aga- 
memnon was  chosen  their  com- 
mander-in-chief. Agamemnon,  al- 
thouffh  the  chief  commander  of  the 
'Wrecks,  is  not  the  hero  of  the  Iliad, 


and  in  chivalrous  spirit,  bravery 
and  character  altogether  inferior  to 
Achilles.  But  he,  nevertheless, 
rises  above  all  the  Greeks  by  his 
dignity,  power  and  majesty,  265,

A'jAX,  called  AiAS  by  the  Greeks. 
Son  of  Telamon,  king  of  Salamis, 
and  grandson  of  .^acus.  He  is 
represented  in  the  Iliad  as  second 
only  to  Achilles  in  bravery.  In  the 
contest  for  the  armor  of  Achilles  he 
was  conquered  by  Ulysses,  and  this, 
says  Homer,  was  the  cause  of  his 
death.  Later  poets  relate  that  his 
defeat  by  Ulysses  threw  him  into 
an  awful  state  of  madness;  that  he 
rushed  from  his  tent,  and  slaugh- 
tered the  sheep  of  the  Greek  army, 
fancying  they  were  his  enemies; 
and  that  at  length  he  put  an  end  to 
his  own  life.  From  his  blood  there 
sprang  up  a  purple  flower  bearing 
the  letters  Ai  (A()  on  its  leaves, 
which  were  at  once  the  initials  of 
his  name  and  expressive  of  a  sigh. 
(2)  Son  of  Oileus,  king  of  the  Lo- 
crians,  also  called  the  lesser  Ajax. 
He  is  described  as  small  of  stature, 
but  skilled  in  throwing  the  spear, 
and,  next  to  Achilles,  the  most 
swift-footed  among  the  Greeks.  On 
his  return  from  Troy  his  vessel  was 
wrecked;  he  himself  got  safe  upon 
a  rock  through  the  assistance  of 
Poseidon  (Neptune);  but  as  he 
boasted  that  he  would  escape  in  de- 
fiance of  the  immortals,  Poseidon 
split  the  rock  with  his  trident,  and 
Ajax  was  swallowed  up  bv  the  sea,

Am-al-the'a,  the  nurse  of  the  infant 
Zeus  (Jupiter)  in  Crete,  was,  accord- 
ing  to  some  traditions,  the   goat 
which  suckled  Zeus,  and  was   re- 
warded by  being  placed  among  the 
stars.    According  to  others,  Amal- 
thea  was  a  nymph  who  fed  Zeus 
with  the  milk  of  a  goat.     When 
this  goat  broke  off  one  of  her  horns, 
Amalthea  filled  it  with  fresh  herbs 
and  gave  it  to  Zeus,  who  placed  it 
among  the  stars.  According  to  other 
accounts,  Zeus  himself  broke  off  one 
of  the  horns  of  the  goat,  and  en- 
dowed it  with  the  wonderful  power 
of  being  filled  with  whatever  the 
possessor  might  wish.    Hence  this 
horn  was  commonly  called  the  horn 
of  plenty,  or  cornucopia,  and  it  was 
used  in  later  times  as  the  symbol 
of  plenty  in  general,  226.

from  the  Caucasus,  and  to  have  set- 
tled in  Asia  Minor.  They  were 
governed  by  a  queen,  and  the  fe- 
male children  had  their  right

of  his  wife  Eriphyle,  who  had  been 
induced  to  persuade  her  husband 
by  the  necklace  of  Harmouia,  which 
Polyuices  had  given  her.    On  leav-

punish  their  mother  for  his  death. 
Pursued,  he  fled  towards  the  rivei

A-pol'i.o.  (Phoebus  Helios  Sol.) 
From  the  sun  comes  our  physical 
light,  but  that  light  is  at  the  same 
time  an  eml)lem  of  all  mental  illu- 
mination, of  knowledge,  truth,  and 
right,  of  all  moral  purity;  and  in 
this  respect  a  distinction  was  made 
between  it  as  a  mental  and  a  physi- 
cal phenomenon — a  distinction 
which  placed  Phoebus  Apollo  on 
one  side  and  Helios  on  the  other. 
Accordingly  Phoebus  Apollo  is  the 
oracular  god  who  throws  light  on 
the  dark  ways  of  the  future,  who 
slays  the  Python,  that  monster  of 
darkness  which  made  the  oracle  at 
Delphi  inaccessible.  He  is  the  god 
of  music  and  song,  which  are  only 
ht^rd  where   light  and   security 


reign  and  the  possession  of  herds  i? 
free  from  danger.  Helios,  on  tin 
other  hand,  is  the  physical  pht- 
nomeJion  of  light,  the  orb  of  tlu

Ar-ca'di-a,  a  country  in  the  middle

sides  by  mountains,  the  Switzer- 
land of  Greece.  The  Arcadians  re- 
garded themselves  as  the  most  an- 
cient people  in  Greece;  the  Greek 
writers  call  them  indigenous  and 
Pelasgians.  They  were  chiefly  em- 
ploj'^ed  in  hunting  and  the  tendiii'.' 
of  cattle,  whence  their  worship  oi 
Pan,  who  was  especially  the  god  of 
Arcadia  and  of  Artemis.  They 
were  passionately  fond  of  music, 
and  cultivated  it  with  success.  The 
Arcadians  experienced  fewer 
changes  than  any  other  people  iu 
Greece,  and  retained  possession  of 
their  country  upon  the  conquest 
of  the  rest  of  Peloponnesus  by  the

in  the  destruction  of  towns.  His 
savage  and  sanguinary  character

Ar'is-ti'des,  an  Athenian,  son  of 
Lysimachus,  s^rnamed  the  "Just," 
was  of  an  ancient  and  noble  family. 
He  fought  as  the  commander  of  his 
tribe  at  the  battle  of  Marathon,  B.C. 
490,  and  the  next  year  he  was  ar- 
chon.  He  was  the  great  rival  of 
Themistocles,  and  it  was  through 
the  influence  of  the  latter  with  the 
people  that  he  suffered  ostracism. 
At  the  battle  of  Salamis  he  did  good 
service  by  dislodging  the  enemy 
with  a  band  raised  and  armed  by 
himself.  He  was  recalled  from 
banishment,  appointed  general,  and 
commanded  the  Athenians  at  the 
i>attle  of  Platsea.  He  and  his  col- 
league Cimon  had  the  glory  of  ob- 
taining for  Athens  the  command  of 
the  maritime  confederacy,  and  to 
Aristides  was  by  general  consent 
intrusted  the  task  of  drawing  up 
its  laws  and  fixing  its  assessments. 
The  first  tribute  paid  into  a  com- 
mon treasury  at  Delos  bore  his 
name,  and  was  regarded  by  the  al- 
lies in  after  times  as  marking  their 
Satnrnian  age.  This  is  his  last  re- 
corded act.  He  probably  died  in 
468.  He  died  so  poor  that  he  did 
not  leave  enough  to  pay  for  his  fu- 
neral ;  his  daughters  were  portioned 
by  the  state,  and  his  son  Lysim- 
achus received  a  grant  of  laud  and 
of  money.

A'te  was  the  goddess  of  infatuation, 
mischief,  and  guilt,  misleading 
tliem  to  actions  that  involved  them 
in  ruiu.  For  this  her  father,  Zeus, 
cast  her  in  anger  from  Olympus, 
and  from  that  time  she  wandered 
about  the  earth  in  search  of  vic- 
tims to  her  malignant  influence 
She  was  spoken  of  as  powerful  ir 
person  and  swift  of  foot,  running 
before  men  to  mislead  them,  278. 

Ath'a-mas,  son  of  ^Eolus  and  Ena^ 
rete,  and  king  of  Orchomeuus,  in 
Bceotia.  At  the  command  of  Hera 
(Juno),  Athamas  married  Nephele, 
by  whom  he  became  the  father  of 
Phrixus  and  Helle.  But  he  wns 
secretly  in  love  with  the  mortal 
Ino,  the  daughter  of  Cadmus,  by 
whom  he  begot  Learchus  and  Me- 
licertes.  Having  thus  incurred  the 
anger  both  of  Hera  and  of  Nephele, 
Athamas  was  seized  with  madness, 
and  in  this  state  killed  his  own  son, 
Learchus.  Ino  threw  herself  with 
Melicertes  into  the  sea,  and  both 
were  changed  into  marine  deities, 
Ino  becoming  Leucothea,  and  Meli- 
certes Pal?emon.  Athamas,  as  the 
murderer  of  his  son,  was  obliged  to 
flee  from  Bceotia,  and  settled  in 
Thessaly,  161,  162,  219.

Ath'ens,  the  capital  of  Attica,  about 
4  miles  from  the  sea,  between  the 
small  rivers  Cephissus  on  the  W. 
and  Ilissuson  the  E.,  the  latter  of 
which  flowed  through  the  town. 
The  most  ancient  part  of  it,  the 
Acropolis,  is  said  to  have  been  built 
by  the  mythical  Cecrops,  but  the 
city  itself  is  said  to  have  owed  its 
origin  to  Theseus,  who  united  the 
12  independent  states  or  townships 
of  Attica  into  one  state,  and  made 
Athens  its  capital.  The  city  was 
burned  by  Xerxes  in  B.C.  480,  but 
was  soon  rebuilt  under  the  admin- 
istration of  Themistocles,  and  was 
adorned  with  public  buildings  by 
Cimon,  and  especially  by  Pericles, 
in  whose  time  (b.c.  460-429)  it 
reached  its  greatest  splendor.  Un- 
der the  Romans,  Athens  continued 
to  be  a  erreat  and  flourishing  city, 
and  they  were  accustomed  to  send 
their  sons  to  Athens,  as  to  a  Uni* 
versity,  for  the  completion  of  tbeii

Wiis  so  dreaded  by  mariners  that 
Xerxes  had  a  canal  cut  throu.uli 
the  isthmus  which  connects  the 
peninsula  with  the  niainlaud,  to 
afford  a  passage  to  his  fleet.  The 
isthmus  is  about  1\  miles  across; 
and  tliere  are  distinct  traces  of  the 
canal  to  be  seeu  iu  the  present  day. 
Tile  peninsula  contained  several

A.t-lan'tis,  according  to  an  ancient 
tradition,  a  great  island  W.  of  the 
Pillars  of  Hercules,  in  the  ocean, 
opposite  Mount  Atlas;  it  possessed 
a  numerous  population,  and  was 
adorned  with  every  beauty;  its 
powerful  princes  invaded  Africa 
and  Europe,  but  were  defeated  by 
the  Athenians  and  their  allies; 
its  inhabitants  afterwards  became 
wicked  and  impious,  and  the  island 
was  in  consequence  swallowed  up 
in  the  ocean  in  a  day  and  a  night. 
This  legend  is  given  by  Plato  in 
the  Timsens,  and  is  said  to  have 
been  related  to  Solon  by  the  Egypt- 
ian priests.  The  Canary  Islands, 
or  the  Azores,  which  perhaps  were 
visited  by  the  Phoenicians,  may 
have  given  rise  to  the  legend;  but 
some  modern  writers  regard  it  as 
indicative  of  a  vague  belief  in  an-

banks,  which  in  antiquity  were

Cen'taurs,  that  is,  the  bull-killers, 
were  au  ancient  race,  inhabiting 
Mount  Peliou  in  Thessaly.  They 
led  a  wild  and  savage  life,  and  are 
hence  called  savage  beasts,  in 
Homer.  In  later  accounts  they 
were  represented  as  half  horses 
and  half  men,  and  are  said  to  have 
been  the  offspring  of  Ixion  and  a 
cloud.  We  know  that  hunting  the 
bull  on  horseback  was  a  national 
custom  in  Thessaly,  and  tliat  the 
Thessalians  were  celebrated  riders. 
Hence  may  have  arisen  the  fable 
that  the  Centaurs  were  half  men 
and  half  horses,  just  as  the  Ameri- 
can Indians,  wlien  they  lirst  saw  a 
Spaniard  on  horseback,  believed 
horse  and  man  to  be  one  being,

of  this  fire-breathing  monster  must

Cui'kon,  the  wisest  and  most  just

(Saturn)  and  Philyra,  lived  on 
Mount  Pel  ion.  He  was  instructed 
by  Apolio  and  Artemis  (Diana),  and 
was  renowned  for  his  skill  in  hunt* 
ing,  medicine,  music,  gymnastics, 
and  the  art  of  prophecy.  All  the 
most  distinguished  heroes  of  Gre- 
cian story,  as  Peleus,  Achilles, 
Diomedes,  etc.,  are  described  as  the 
pupils  of  Chiron  in  these  arts.  Ho 
saved  Peleus  from  the  other  Cen- 
taurs, who  were  on  the  point  of  kill- 
ing him,  and  he  also  restored  to 
him  tlie  sword  which  Acastus  had 
concealed.  Hercules,  too,'  was  his 
friend  ;  but  while  fighting  with  the 
other  Centaurs  one  of  the  poisoned 
arrows  of  Hercules  struck  Chiron, 
who,  although  immortal,  would  not 
live  any  longer,  and  gave  his  im- 
mortality to  Prometheus.  Zeus 
placed  Cliiron  among  the  stars  as 
Sagittarius,  158,  219.

Amphion  and  Niobe ;  she  and  her

is  often  confounded  with  the  god- 
dess of  spring,  who  was  also  espe- 
cially worshipped  as  a  Hora,  under 
the  title  of  Chloris,  which  corre- 
sponds to  the  Roman  Flora.  She 
was  the  goddess  of  buds  and  flow- 
ers, of  whom  Boreas,  the  north

CRcE'sirs,  king  of  Lydia,  reigned  B.a 
560-546.  Tlie  fame  of  his  power 
and  wealth  drew  to  his  court  at 
Sardisall  the  wise  men  of  Greece, 
and  among  them  Solon.  In  reply 
to  the  question,  who  was  the  hap- 
piest man  he  had  ever  seen,  the 
sage  taught  the  king  that  no  mai< 
should  be  deemed  happy  till  lie  ha^ 
finislied  his  life  in  a  happy  way. 
In  a  war  with  Cyrus,  king  of  Per- 
sia, Croesus  wjis  defeated  and  his 
capital,  Sardis,  was  taken.  Cra?sus 
was  condemned  by  the  conqueror 
to  be  burned  to  death.  As  he  stood 
before  the  pyre,  the  warning  of  So- 
lon came  to  liis  mind,  and  he  thrice 
uttered  the  name  of  Solon.  Cyrus 
in(|uired  who  it  was  that  he  called 
on  ;  and  upon  hearing  the  story  re- 
pented of  his  purpose,  and  notonly 
spared  the  life  of  Crcesus,  but  made 
him  his  friend.  It  is  also  said  that 
his  boy,  born  dumb,  first  spoke  at

Pelasgians,  and  later  generations,

Cy-clo'pes,  that  is,  creatures  with 
round  or  circular  eyes,  are  de- 
scribed differently  by  diflerent 
writers.  Homer  speaks  of  them  as 
a  gigantic  and  lawless  race  of  sin^p- 
herds  in  Sicily,  who  devoured  hu- 
man beings  and  cared  naught  for 
Zeus;  each  of  them  had  only  one 
eye  in  the  centre  of  his  forehead 
They  were  thrown  into  Tartarus 
by  Cronus,  but  were  released  by 
Zeus,  and  in  consequence  they  pro

vided  Zeus  with  thunderbolts  and 
lightning,  Pluto  with  a  helmet, 
and  Poseidon  with  a  trideut.  They 
were  afterwards  killed  by  Apollo 
for  having  furnished  Zeus  with 
the  thunderbolts  to  kill  ^scula- 
pius.  A  still  later  tradition  re- 
garded the  Cyclopes  as  the  assist- 
ants of  Vulcan.  Volcanoes  were 
the  workshops  of  that  god,  and 
Mount  JEtna  in  Sicily  and  the 
neighboring  isles  were  accordingly 
considered  as  their  abodes.  It  is 
now  generally  conceded  that  the 
Cyclopes  were  simply  the  personifi- 
cation of  the  forces  of  the  sky,  151,

Da-na'i-des,  the  fifty  daughters  of 
Danaus,  king  of  Argos,  were  be- 
trothed to  the  fifty  sons  of  JEgj'p- 
tus,  but  were  commanded  by  their 
father  to  slay  each  her  own  hus- 
band on  the  marriage  night.  All 
obeyed  his  order  except  Hyperm- 
nestra,  who,  preferring  to  be  re- 
garded as  of  weak  resohition  than 
as  a  murderess,  spared  her  husband, 
Lyuceus,  and  became  the  mother  of 


the  Argive  line  of  kings.  While 
Zeus  approved  the  murderous  deed 
of  her  forty-nine  sisters,  and  sent 
Athene  and  Hermes  to  give  them 
expiation,  Hypermnestra  was  cast 
into  a  dungeon  by  her  indignant 
father,  her  husband,  Lynceus,  sav- 
ing himself  by  flight.  On  being 
brought  to  trial  she  was,  however 
publicly  acquitted;  her  husbands 
returning  to  Argos,  succeeded  Dan- 
aus on  the  throne,  and  in  a*.ier 
times  was  widely  respected,  among 
other  things  for  having  founded 
the  great  festival  in  honor  of  the 
Argive  Hera.  The  prize  of  victory 
i  a  the  games  that  accompanied  that 
festival  was  a  shield,  not  a  wreath, 
as  was  elsewhere  usual ;  the  tradi- 
tion being  that  on  the  first  occa- 
sion of  these  games  Lynceus  pre- 
sented his  son  Abas  with  the  shield 
which  had  belonged  to  Danaus. 
Whether  it  was  to  obtain  husbands 
for  his  daughters  who  had  accom^ 
plished  their  own  widowhood,  or 
whether  it  was  to  decide  among  a 
multitude  of  suitors  for  their 
hands,  Danaus  held  a  kind  of  tour- 
nament, the  victors  in  which  were 
to  be  accepted  as  husbands.  On 
the  morning  of  the  contest  he 
ranged  his  daughters  together  on 
the  course,  and  by  noon  each  had 
been  carried  off  by  a  victorious 
athlete,  a  scion  of  some  noble  house.

On  tlic  night  on  which  Alexander 
the  Great  was  born  it  was  set  fire 
to  and  almost  completely  destroyed 
by  a  man  named  Herostratus,  who 
thus  gained  his  object,  which  waa 
to  enrol  his  name  on  the  page  of 
history.  Afterwards,  when  Alex- 
ander had  acquired  renown  by  his 
extraordinary  conquests  in  Asia, 
this  coincidence  was  remarked  and 
accepted  as  having  been  an  omeu 
of  his  future  fame.  Whether  he 
himself  believed  so  or  not,  he 
gladly  assisted  in  the  rebuilding  of 
the  building,  so  when  finished  it 
was  more  magnificent  than  before.

Dionysus.  In  December  a  festival 
with  all  manner  of  rustic  enjoy- 
ments w^as  held  iu  honor  of  Dio- 
nysus in  the  country  about  Athens. 
In  January,  a  festival  called  Lentea 
was  held  in  his  honor  in  the  town, 
at  which  one  of  the  principal  fea- 
tures was  a  nocturnal  and  orgiastic 
procession  of  women.  Then  fol- 
lowed, in  February,  the  Anthes- 
teria,  the  first  day  of  which 
was  called  "cask-opening  day," 
and  the  second  "pouring-day." 
Lastly  came  the  great  festival  of 
the  year,  the  Great  Dionysia,  which 
was  held  in  the  town  of  Athens, 
and  lasted  from  the  ninth  to  the 
fifteenth  of  March,  the  religious 
part  of  the  ceremony  consisting  of 
a  procession,  in  which  an  ancient 
wooden  image  of  the  god  was  car- 
ried through  the  streets  from  one 
sanctuary  to  another,  accompanied 
by  excited  songs.  The  theatre  of 
Dionysus  was  daily  the  scene  of 
splendid  dramatic  performances, 
and  the  whole  town  was  astir  and

El-eu-sin'i-an  Festivals.  There 
were  two  festivals  held  annually, — 
the  lesser  in  spring,  when  the  ear- 
liest flowers  appeared,  and  the 
greater  in  the  month  of  September. 
The  latter  occupied  niue  days,  com- 
mencing on  the  night  of  the  20th 
with  a  torchlight  procession. 
Though  similar  festivals  existed 
in  various  parts  of  Greece,  and  even 
of  Italy,  those  of  Eleusis  in  Attica 
continued  to  retain  something  like 
national  importance,  and,  from  the 
immense  concourse  of  people  who 
came  to  take  part  in  them,  were 
among  the  princijial  attractions  of 
Athens.  TIk;  duties  of  higli  priest 
were  vested  in  the  family  of  Eu- 
molpidre,  whose  ancestor  Eumol- 
pus,  ac^cording  to  one  account,  had 
been  installed  in  the  ottice  by  Ceres 
herself.  Tlie  festival  was  brouulit 
to  a  close  by  games,  among  which 
was  that  of  l)nll-b;iiting. 
liL-£U-6iN'i-AN  Mysteries.      These 


mysteries  had  been    instituted  bj 
Ceres,  herself,  and  we  know  from 
the  testimony  of  men  like  Piudat 
and  iEschylus,  who  had   been   in- 
itiated, that  they  were  well  calcu- 
lated   to    awaken    most  profound 
feelings  of    piety  and   a  cheerful 
hope  of  better  life  in  the  future.    U 
is  believed  that  the  ceremony  of  in- 
itiation consisted,  not  in    instruc 
tion  as  to  what  to  believe  or  how  tc 
act  to  be    worthy  of  Persephone's 
favor,  but    in  elaborate    and    pro 
longed  representations  of   the  vari 
ou3  scenes  aud  acts  on  earth  and 
under  it  connected  with  her  abduc- 
tion by  Hades.    The  ceremony  took 
place  at  night,   and  it  is  probable 
that  advantage    was   taken  of  the 
darkness  to  make  the  scenes  in  the 
lower  world  more  hideous  and  im- 
pressive.    Probably  these  represen- 
tations were  reserved  for  the  Epop- 
tie,  or  persons  in  the  final  stage  of 
initiation.     Those    in    the    earliet 
stages  were  called  Mystse.     Asso- 
ciated with  Ceres  and  Persephone 
in  the  worship  of  Eleusis  was  Di- 
onysus in  his  youthful   character 
and  under  the    name  of   Jacchus, 
But  at   what    time  this   first   took 
place,  whether  it  was  due  to  some 
affinity  in  the  orgiastic  nature  of 
his  worship,  or  rather  to  his  local 
connection  with  Attica  as  god  of  the 
vine,  is  not  known.

to  call  these  fearful  goddesses  b-- 
their  real  name.  It  was  said  to 
have  been  first  given  them  after  t)»6 
acquittal  of  Orestes  by  the  Areopt 
gus,  when  the  auger  of  the  Eriuys 
had  been  soothed.  They  are  rep- 
resented as  the  daughters  of  Earth 
or  of  Night,  and  as  fearful  winged 
maidens,  with  serpents  twined  in 
their  hair,  and  with  blood  dripping 
from  their  eyes.  They  dwelt  in 
the  depths  of  Tartarus,  dreaded  by 
gods  and  men.  With  later  writers 
their  number  is  usually  three,  and 
their  names  are  Tisiphone,  Alecto, 
and  Megaera.  They  punished  men 
both  in  this  world  and  after  death. 
The  sacrifices  offered  to  thei)^  con- 
sisted of  black  sheep  and  uepnaiia, 
i.  e.,  a  drink  of  honey  mixed  with 
water.  The  crimes  which  they 
chiefly  punished  were  disobedience 
towards  parents,  violation  of  the 
respect  due  to  old  age,  perjury, 
murder,  violation  of  the  laws  of 
hospitality,  and  improper  conduct 
towards  suppliants,  13,  251,  292.

Eu-Ro'pA,  daughter  of  the  Phoeni-

the  Iliad,  daughter  of  Phoenix. 
Her  beauty  charmed  Zeus  (Jupi- 
ter), who  assumed  the  form  of  a 
bull,  and  mingled  with  the  herd  as 
Europa  and  her  maidens  were 
sporting  on  the  sea-shore.  Encour- 
aged by  the  tameness  of  the  ani- 
mal, Europa  tried  to  mount  his 
back;  whereupon  the  god  rushed 
into  the  sea,  and  swam  with  her  to 
Crete.  Here  she  became  by  Zeus 
the  mother  of  Minos,  Rhadaman-

Fama,  the  goddess  of  fame  or  re- 
port, whether  good  or  bad,  was  said 
to  be  a  daughter  of  Gaea,  and  bora 
at  the  time  of  her  great  indignation 
at  the  overthrow  of  the  Giauts. 
Sleepless,  always  prying,  swift  of 
foot,  Fama  announced  whatever 
she  saw  or  heard  of,  at  first  in  a 
whisper  addressed  only  to  a  few 
persons,  then  by  degrees  louder  and 
to  a  larger  circle,  until  finally  she 
had  traversed  heaven  and  earth 
communicating  it.  She  was  repre- 
sented as  a  tender,  gentle  figure, 
winged,  and  holding  a  trumpet. 

Fam'ixe,  215,  216. 

Fate,  the  Greek  name  being 
Ananke,  the  Eoman  Fatura,  was  a 
personification  of  the  unalterable 
necessity  that  appeared  to  control 
the  career  of  mankind  and  the 
events  of  the  world.  Gods,  as  well 
as  men,  were  subject  to  its  un- 
changing decrees.  This  deity  wag 
the  offspring  of  Night  and  Erebus. 
Her  sentences  were  carried  out  by 
tlie  Parca:^,  who,  however,  were 
also  looked  upon  as  independent 
deities  of  fate.  She  was  represented 
standing  on  a  globe,  aud  holding  an 
urn. 

Fates.  They  were  described  aa 
daughters  of  Night— to  indicate 
the  darkness  and  obscurity  of  hu- 
man fate — or  of  Zeus  and  Themis, 
that  is,  "daughters  of  the  just 
heavens."  Another  story  has  it 
that  it  was  they  who  united  Themis 
and  ZiMis  in  marriage,  the  same 
ceremony,  according  to  another  ver- 
sion of  the  myth,  having  been  per- 
formed by  them  to  Zeus  and  Hera. 
It  was  nuliiral  to  suppose  the  crod- 
desses  of  fate  present  and  taking 
part  at  marriages  aud  births.    The

names  of  the  three  sisters  were 
Clotho,  Laehesis,  ami  Atropos.  To 
express  the  inlluence  whicli  they 
were  believed  to  exercise  on  huinau 
life  from  birth  to  death,  they  were 
conceived  as  occupied  in  spinning 
a  thread  of  gold,  silver  or  wool; 
now  tightening,  now  slackening, 
and  at  last  catting  it  otr.  This  oc- 
cupation was  so  arranged  among 
the  three,  that  Clotho,  the  young- 
est, put  the  wool  round  the  spindle, 
Lachesis  spun  it,  and  Atropos,  the 
eldest,  cut  it  oflf  when  a  man  had  to 
die.  Tyche,  or  Fortuna,  on  account 
of  the  similarity  of  her  functions, 
has  been  regarded,  but  incorrectly, 
as  a  fourth  sister.  Tliey  were  rep- 
resented in  art  as  serious  maidens, 
always  side  by  side,  and  in  most 
cases  occupied  as  we  have  men- 
tioned; there  are  instances,  how- 
ever, in  which  Atropos,  the  '*  unal- 
terable," is  represented  alone. 
They  were  worshipped  very  seri- 
ously both  in  Greece  and  Italy ; 
sacrifices  of  honey  and  flowers, 
sometimes  of  ewes,  were  offered  to 
them,  while  in  Sparta  and  in  Eome 
they  had  temples  and  altars,  13,  73, 
84,  215, 227,  223,  328. 

Fauns,  16,  96. 

Fau'nus,  son  of  Picus,  grandson  of 
Saturnus,  and  father  of  Latinus, 
was  the  third  in  the  series  of  the 
kings  of  the  Laurentes.  He  was 
worshipped  as  the  protecting  deity 
of  agriculture  and  of  shepherds,  and 
also  as  a  giver  of  oracles.  After  the 
introduction  of  the  worship  of  the 
Greek  Pan  into  Italy,  Faunus  was 
identified  with  Pan,  and  repre- 
sented, like  the  latter,  with  horns 
and  goat's  feet.  At  a  later  time 
we  find  mention  of  Fauni  in  the 
plural.  What  Faunus  was  to  the 
male  sex,  his  wife  Faula  or  Fauna 
was  to  the  female.  As  the  god 
manifested  himself  in  various  ways, 
the  idea  arose  of  a  plurality  of 
Fauns  (Fauni),  who  are  described 
as  half  men,  half  goats,  and  with 
horns.  Faunus  gradually  came  to 
be  identified  with  the  Arcadian 
Pan,  and  the  Fauni  with  the  Greek 
Satyrs,  16,  49,  212,  200,  340.

Angerboda — the      "»ffspring     were 


three.  The  Wolf,  the  Serpent,  and 
Death.  The  Fenris  wolf  is  supposed 
to  have  personated  the  element  of 
fire,  destructive  except  when 
chained,  420,  421,  433,  439. 

Fen-sa'lir.  Freya's  palace,  called 
the  Hall  of  the  Sea.  Here  were 
brought  together  lovers,  husbaiu/'j 
and  wives  who  had  been  separated 
by  death,  433. 

Fe-ro'ni'-a,  an  ancient  Italian  di-

at  Terracina,  near  Mount  Soracte. 
At  her  festival  at  this  place  a  great 
fair  was  held.

ga  was  the  best  and  dearest  to  Odin. 
Siie  sat  enthroned  beside  him,  and 
surveyed  the  world.  She  knew 
all,  and  exercised  control  over  the 
whole  face  of  nature.  She  is  usu- 
ally attended  by  her  handmaiden 
Full  or  Fulla.  She  was  also  a  god- 
dess and  presided  over  smiling  na- 
ture, sending  sunshine,  rain,  and 
harvest.  She  was  further  a  god- 
dess into  whose  charge  the  dead 
passed.  As  has  been  said,  half  the 
number  of  heroes  who  fell  in  battle 
belonged  to  her.  She  is  often  rep- 
resented driving  in  a  cart  drawn  by

earth,  is  described  as  the  first  being 
that  sprung  from  Cliaos,  and  gave 
birth  to  Uranus  (Heaven)  and  Pou- 
tus  (Sea).  By  Uranus  she  became 
the  motber  of  tbe  Titans,  wlio  were 
hated  by  their  father.  Ge  there- 
fore concealed  them  in  the  bosom 
of  the  earth  ;  and  she  made  a  large 
iron  sickle,  with  which  Cronos 
(Saturn)  mutilated  Uranus.  Ge  or 
Tell  us  was  regarded  by  both  Greeks 
and  Romans  as  one  of  tlie  gods  of 
the  nether  world,  and  hence  is  fre- 
luently  mentioned  where  they  are

Games.  These  were  four  in  number: 
the  Olympian,  Pythian,  Nemean,  and 
Isthmian.  The  first  mentioned  was 
held  in  honor  of  Zeus,  on  the  plain 
of  Olympia,  in  Elis.  It  occurred 
every  fifth  year,  and  the  usual 
method  of  reckoning  time  was  ac- 
cording to  its  reoccurrence — by 
Olympiads,  as  we  say.  The  games 
with  which  it  was  celebrated  con- 
sisted of  running,  wrestling,  box- 
ing, a  combination  of  the  two  lat- 
ter, horse-racing,  either  with  chari- 
ots or  only  with  riders.  The  prize 
of  victory  was  simply  a  wreath  of 
olive,  and  yet  athletes  trained 
themselves  laboriously  and  trav- 
elled great  distances  to  compete  for 
it.  Kings  sent  their  horses  to  run 
in  the  races,  and  counted  a  victory 
among  the  highest  honors  of  their 
lives.  The  fellow  townsmen  of  a 
victorious  athlete  would  raise  a 
statue  in  his  honor.  Occasionally 
writers,  as  we  are  told  of  Herodo- 
tus, took  this  occasion  of  a  vast  as- 
semblage of  their  countrymen  to 
read  to  them  part*"  of  their  writings. 
The  Pythian  games  were  held  in 
honor  of  Apollo,  in  the  neighbor- 
hood of  Delplii,  and  occurred  every 
fifth  year,  there  being  competition 
in  music  as  well  as  in  athletics. 
,  The  i)riz;o  was  a  wreath  of  laurel. 
At  the  Nenu-an  ganu^s,  which  were 
held  in  honur  of  Zens,  the  ]»rize 
was  a  wrcatii  <»f  ivy.  The  Isthmian 
games  were  held  in  honor  of  Posei- 
don (Neptune)  on  the  Isthmus  of 
Corinth,  and  occurred  every  third 
year;  the  ])rize  was  a  wreath  of 
pine,  29,  197. 

Ga.n'y-mede,  son  of  Tros  and  Cal- 


lirrhoe,  and  brother  of  Ilua  and 
Assaracus,  was  the  most  beautiful 
of  all  mortals,  and  was  carried  off 
by  the  gods  that  he  might  fill  the 
cup  of  Zeus,  and  live  among  the 
immortal  gods.  This  is  the  Ho- 
meric account.  Later  writers  state 
that  Zeus  himself  carried  him  oft*, 
in  the  form  of  an  eagle,  or  by 
means  of  his  eagle.  There  is, 
further,  no  agreement  as  to  the 
place  where  the  event  occurred, 
though  later  writers  usually  repre- 
sent him  as  carried  otf  from  Mount 
Ida.  Zeus  compensated  the  father 
for  his  loss  by  a  pair  of  divine 
horses.  Astronomers  placed  Gany- 
medes  among  the  stars  under  the 
name  of  Aquarius.  His  name  was 
sometimes  corrupted  in  Latin  into 
Catamitus,  187,  188.

Ge'ni-us,  a  protecting  spirit,  anal-

The  belief  in  such  spirits  existed 
both  in  Greece  and  at  Rome.  The

was  their  mother.  They  are  repre- 
s^ntt'd  as  beings  of  a  monstrous  size, 
with  fearful  countenances  and  the 
tails  of  dragons.  They  made  an 
attack  upon  heaven,  being  armed 
with  huire  rocks  and  trunks  of

Ha'des,  the  god  of  the  nether  world 
In   ordinary  life   be    was   usuallj 
called  Pluto  (the  giver  of  wealth), 
because  people  did  not  like  to  pro- 
nounce the  dreaded  name  of  Hades 
/     or  Aides.    The  Koman  poets  use 
the  names  Dis,  Orcus  and  Tartarus 
as  synonymous  with  Pluto.    Hades 
was  the  son  of  Cronus  (Saturn)  and 
Rhea,  and  brother  of  Zeus  (jupi- 
iter)  and  Poseidon  (Neptune).    His 
wife  was  Persephone  or  Proserpina, 
the  daughter  of  Ceres,  whom  he 
carried  off  from  the  upper  world, 
as    is    related    elsewhere.    In  the 
division  of  the  world  among  the 
3    brothers.    Hades    obtained    the 
nether  world,  the    abode    of   the 
shades,  over  which  he  ruled.    His 
character  is  described  as  fierce  and 
inexorable,  whence  of  all  the  gods 
he   was    most    hated    by  mortals. 
The  sacrifices  oftered  to  him  and 
Persephone     consisted    of     black 
sheep;  and  the  person  who  oflTered 
the  sacrifice  had  to  turn  away  his 
face.    Tlie  ensign  of  his  power  was 
a  staff,  with  which,  like  Hermes, 
he  drove  the  shades  into  the  lower 
world.    Tliere  he  sat  upon  a  throne 
with  his  consort  Persephone.     He 
possessed  a  helmet  which  rendered 
the  wearer  invisible,  and  which  he 
sometimes  lent  to  both  gods  and 
men.    Like  the  other  gods,  he  was 
not  a  faitliful  husl>and;  the  Furies 
are    called     his    daughters;      the 
nymph   IMintiio,   whom   he  loved, 
was  metamorphosed  by  Persephone 
into  the  plant  called  mint;  and  the 
nymph  Leuce,  whom   he  likewise 
loved,  was  chaiiged  by  him  after 
death  into  a  white  poplar.     Being 
the  king  of  the  lower  world,  Pluto 
is  the  giver  of  all   the  blessings 
that  came  from  the  earth;  hence 
he  gives  the  metals  contained  in 
the  earth,  and  is  called  Pluto.     In 
works    of   art    he    resembles    his 
brothers  Zeus  and  Poseidon,  excepi 
that  his  hair  falls  over  his  forehead,

Hec^a-te,    a    mysterious    divinity, 
commonly  represented  as  a  daugh- 
ter of  Persaeus  or  Perses  and  As- 
teria,    and    hence    called    Perseis. 
She  was  one  of  the  Titans,  and  the 
only  one  of  this  race  who  retained 
Lrir  power  under  the  rule  of  Zeus. 
She  was  honored  by  all    the   im- 
mortal   gods,    and    the    extensive 
po^'er  possessed  by  her  was  prob- 
ably the  reason  that  she  was  subse- 
quently   identified    with     several 
other  divinities.    Hence  she  is  said 
to  have  been   Selene  or  Luna  in 
heaven,  Artemis  or  Diana  on  eartli, 
and  Persephone  or   Proserpina  in 
the  lower  world.     Being  thus,  as  it 
were,  a  threefold   goddess,   she  is 
described  with  3  bodies  or  3  heads. 
Hence  her  epithets  Terqeminn,  Tri- 
formis,    Triceps,  etc.     She  took  an 
active  part  in  the  search  after  Pro- 
serpina, and,  when  the  latter  was 
found,  remained  with  her  as  her 
attendant    and    companion.       She 
thus  became  a  deity  of  the  lower 
world,  and  is  described  in  thisca   j 
pacity  as  a  mighty  and  foruiidable 
divinity.      She    was    sujjposed    to 
send  at  night  all  kinds  of  demons 
aud  terrible  phantoms   from    the 
lower  world.     She  taught  sorcery 
and     witchcraft,     and     dwelt     at 
places  where  two  roads  crossed,  on 
tombs,  and  near  the  blood  of  mui'- 
dered   persons.    She  herself  wan- 


dered about  with  the  souls  of  the 
dead,  aud  her  approach  was  an- 
nounced by  the  whining  and  howl- 
ing of  dogs.  At  Athens,  at  the 
close  of  every  nmnth,  dishes  with 
food  were  set  out  for  her  at  the 
points  where  two  roads  crossed; 
and  til  is  food  was  consumed  by 
poor  people.  The  sacrifices  offered 
to  her  consisted  of  dogs,  honey, 
and  black  female  lambs,  164,  167,

Thrace.    She  was  the  wife  of  Priam, 
king  of   Troy,  to  whom  she  bore 
Hector,  Paris,  and  many  other  chil- 
dren.    After  the  fall  of  Troy  she 
was  carried  away  as  a  slave  by  the 
Greeks.  On  the  coast  of  Thrace  she 
revenged  the   murder  of  her   son 
Polydorus  by  slaying  Polymestor.

He'lios,  called  Sol  by  the  Romans, 
the  god  of  the  sun.  He  was  the 
son  of  Hyperion  and  Thea,  and  a 
brother  of  Selene  and  Eos.  From 
his  father,  he  is  frequently  called 
Hyperion.  Honjer  describes  Helios 
as  rising  in  the  E.  from  Oceanus, 
traversing  the  heavens,  and  de- 
scending in  the  evening  into  the 
darkness  of  the  W.  and  Oceanus. 
Later  poets  have  marvellously  em- 
bellished this  simple  notion.  They 
tell  of  a  magnificent  palace  of 
Helios  in  the  E.,  from  which  he 
starts  in  the  morning  in  a  chariot 
drawn  by  four  horses.  They  also 
assign  him  a  second  palace  in  the 
W.,  and  describe  his  horses  as 
feeding  upon  herbs  growing  in  the 
islands  of  the  Blessed.  Helios  is 
described  as  the  god  who  sees  and 
hears  everything,  and  is  thus  able 
to  reveal  to  Vulcan  the  faithless- 
ness of  Aphrodite  (Venus)  and  to 
Ceres  the  abduction  of  her  daugh- 
ter. At  a  later  time  Helios  became 
identified  with  Apollo,  though  the 
two  gods  were  originally  quite  dis- 
tinct. He  was  worshipped  in  many 
parts  of  Greece,  and  especially  in 
the  island  of  Rhodes,  where  the 
famous  Colossus  was  a  representa- 
tion of  the  god.  The  sacrifices 
offered  to  him  consisted  of  white 
rams,  boars,  bulls,  goats,  lambs,  and 
especially  white  horses  and  honey.

He'ka,  called  Juno  by  the  Romans, 
The  Greek  Hera,  that  is.  Mistress, 
was  a  daughter  of  Cronos  (Saturn) 
and  Rhea,  and  sister  and  wife  of 
Zeus  (Jupiter).  According  to  Ho- 
mer, she  was  brought  up  by  Oce- 
anus and  Tethys,  and  afterwards 
became  the  wife  of  Zeus,  without 
the  knowledge  of  her  parents. 
Later  writers  add  that  she,  like  the 
other  children  of  Cronos,  was  swal- 
lowed by  her  father,  but  afterwards 
restored.  In  the  Iliad,  Hera  is 
treated  by  the  Olympian  gods  with 
the  same  reverence  as  her  husband. 
Zeus  himself  listens  to  her  coun- 
sels, and  communicates  his  secrets 
to  her.  She  is,  notwithstanding, 
far  inferior  to  him  in  power,  and 
must  obey  him  unconditionally. 
She  is  not,  like  Zeus,  the  queen  of 
gods  and  men,  but  simply  the  wife 
of  the  supreme  god.  The  idea  of 
her  being  the  queen  of  heaven,  with 
regal  wealth  and  power,  is  of  much 
later  date.  Her  character,  as  de- 
scribed by  Homer,  is  not  of  a  very 
amiable  kind;  and  her  jealousy, 
obstinacy  and  quarrelsome  disposi- 
tion sometimes  make  her  husband 
tremble.  Hence  arise  frequent  dis- 
putes between  Hera  and  Zeus ;  and 
on  one  occasion  Hera,  in  conjunc- 
tion with  Poseidon  (Neptune)  and 
Athena  (Minerva),  contemplated 
putting  Zeus  into  chains.  Zeus,  in 
such  cases,  not  only  threatens,  but 
beats  her.  Once  he  even  hung  her 
up  in  the  clouds,  with  her  hands 
chained,  and  with  two  anvils  sus- 
pended from  her  feet;  and  on  an- 
other occasion,  when  Hephaestus' 
(Vulcan)  attempted  to  help  her, 
Zeus  hurled  him  down  from  Olym- 
pus. By  Zeus  she  was  the  mother  of 
Ares  (Mars),  Hebe  and  Hephaestus. 
Hera  was,  properly  speaking,  the 
owly  really  married  goddess  among 
the  Olympians,  for  the  marriage  of 
Aphrodite  (Venus)  with  Hephaestus 
can  scarcely  be  taken  into  consider- 
ation. Hence  she  is  the  goddess  of 
marriage  and  of  the  birth  of  chil-

Hes'ti-a,  called  Vesta  by  the  Eo- 
mans,  the  goddess  of  the  hearth,  or, 
rather,  of  the  fire  burning  on  the 
hearth,  was  one  of  the  twelve  great 
divinities  of  the  Greeks.  She  was 
a  daughter  of  Cronos  (Saturn)  and 
Rhea,  and,  according  to  common 
tradition,  was  the  first-born  of 
Rhea,  and  consequently  the  first 
of  tlie  children  swallowed  by  Cro- 
nos. Slie  was  a  maiden  divinity; 
and  when  Apollo  and  Poseidon 
(Neptuue)  sued  for  her  hand,  she 
swore  by  the  heaJ  of  Zeus  to  re- 

'  main  a  virgin  for  ever.  As  the 
hearth  was  looked  upon  as  the  cen- 
tre of  domestic  life,  ^o  Hestia  was 
the  goddess  of  domestic  life,  and,  as 
such,  was  believed  to  dwell  in  the 
inner  part  of  every  house.  Being 
the  goddess  of  the  sacred  fires  of  the 
altar.  Hestia  had  a  share  in  the 
sacrifices  offered  to  all  the  gods. 
Hence  the  first  part  of  every  sacri- 
fice was  presented  to  her.  Solemn 
oaths  were  sworn  by  the  goddess  of 
the  hearth;  and  the  heartli  itself  was 
the  sacred  asylum  where  suppliants 
implored  the  protection  of  the  in- 
hal)itants  of  the  house.  A  town  or 
city  is  only  an  extended  family, 
and  therefore  had  likewise  its  sa- 
cred hearth.  This  public  hearth 
usually  existed  in  the  prytaneuni 
of  a  town,  where  the  goddess  had 
her  especial  sanctuarv.  There,  as 
at  a  private  hearth,  Hestia  protect- 
ed the  suppliants.     When  a  colony 


was  sent  out,  the  emigrants  took 
the  fire  which  was  to  burn  on  the 
hearth  of  their  new  home  from 
that  of  the  mother  town.  The  wor- 
ship of  the  Roman  Vesta  is  spoken 
of  under  Vesta,  16.

ing  to  Hesiod,  a  daughter  of  Zeus 
and  Themis,  and  one  of  the  Horae. 
She  was  worshipped  at  Athens  and 
^ome;  and  in  the  latter  city  a 
magnificent  temple  was  built  to 
her  by  the  emperor  Vespasian.  Pax 
is  represented  ou  coins  as  a  youth- 
ful female,  holding  in  her  left  arm 
a  cornucopia,  and  in  her  right  hand 
an  olive-branch  or  the  staff  of  Mer- 
cury, 354. 

Tris,  goddess  of  the  rainbow,  was  a 
daughter  of  Thaumas  and  Electra. 
a  granddaughter  of  Oceanus  and 
Gae,  and  a  sister  of  the  Harpies. 
As  messenger  of  Juno  and  Zeus, 
she  lived  among  the  other  deities 
of  Olympus,  which  she  only  left  for 
the  purpose  of  conveying  the  di- 
vine commands  to  mankind,  by 
whom  she  was  looked  on  as  a  guide 
and  adviser.  She  travelled,  always 
with  the  speed  of  wind,  from  one 
end  of  the  world  to  the  other,  could 
penetrate  to  the  bottom  of  the  sea, 
or  to  the  Styx,  and  in  this  respect 
formed  a  female  counterpart  of 
Mercury  in  his  capacity  of  messen- 
ger of  the  gods,  and  held  much  the 
same  position  towards  Hera  as  he 
did  towards  Zeus.  It  was  Iris,  the 
ancients  believe,  who  charged  the 
clouds  with  water  from  lakes  and 
rivers,  in  order  that  they  might  let 
it  fall  again  upon  the  earth  in 
gentle  fertilizing  showers ;  and,  ac- 
cordingly, when  her  bow  appeared 
in  the  clouds  the  farmer  welcomed 
it  as  a  sign  of  rain  to  quicken  his 
fields,  and  gladly  paid  honors  to 
the  goddess  whose  presence  he 
recognized  in  the  rainbow  with  its 
splendid  colors.  She  was  repre- 
sented as  a  beautiful  virgin,  with 
wings  of  varied  hue,  in  robes  of 
bright  colors,  and  riding  on  a  rain- 
bow; at  other  times  with  a  nimbus 
on  her  head  in  which  the  colors  of 
the  rainbow  were  reflected,  8, 90, 91,

I'sis  was  th^  wife  of  Osiris,  also  a 
counterpart  of  him;  for,  as  he  was 
judge  of  tlie  dead,  so  she  is  de- 
scribed as  the  giver  of  death.  She  is 
identified  with  Ceres  and  Perseph- 
one, and,  in  this  view,  the  grief 
of  Isis  for  her  husband  may  be  re- 
garded as  an  Egyptian  version  of 
the  myth  representing  Demeter  as 
mourning  for  the  loss  of  her  daugh- 


ter. Apuleius  makes  her  declare: 
"  I  am  Nature,  the  parent  of  all  the 
gods,  mistress  of  all  the  elements, 
the  beginning  of  all  the  ages,  sov- 
ereign of  the  gods,  queen  of  the 
manes,  and  the  first  of  the  heaven- 
ly beings.  My  divinity,  uniform  in 
itself,  is  honored  under  numerous 
forms,  various  rites,  and  different 
names,  .  .  .  but  the  sun-illumed 
Ethiopians,  and  the  Egyptians  re- 
nowned for  ancient  lore,  worship 
me  with  due  ceremonies,  and  call 
me  by  ray  real  name,  'Queen  Isis.' " 
Plutarch  considers  Isis  to  be  the 
earth,  the  feminine  part  of  nature, 
while  Diodorus  says  that  the 
Egyptians,  considering  the  earth  to 
be  the  parent  of  all  things  born, 
called  her  Mother,  just  as  the 
Greeks  called  earth  Demeter,  368,

nected with  the  city  by  means  of

Ja'nus  was  a  deity  unknown  to  the 
Greeks,  but  from  the  earliest  times 
held  in  high  estimation  by  the 
Romans,  who  placed  liim  on  almost 
an  equal  footing  with  Jupiter,  even 
giving  his  name  precedence  in  their 
prayers,  and  invoking  the  aid  of 
both  deities  previous  to  every  un- 
dertaking. To  him  they  ascribed 
the  origin  of  all  things,  the  intro- 
duction of  the  system  of  years,  the 
change  of  season,  the  ups  and 
downs  of  fortune,  and  the  civfliza-

of  agriculture,  industry,  arts,  and 
re/igion.     Ho  was  represented  witli 
two    lieads,  one    being    tliat   of   a 
youth,  to  indicate  "  beginning,"  the 
other  that  of  an  old  man,  to  indi- 
cate the  end,  whence  he  was  styled 
Bifrons  (two-headed).     In  his  left 
hand   is  a  key,  to  show    that   he 
opens  at  the  beginning  and  shuts 
at  the  end  ;  the  sceptre  in  his  right 
is  a  sign  that  he  controls  the  pro- 
gress of  every  undertaking.     The 
first    day    of    January,    a    month 
named   after  him,   being  the  first 
day  of  a  new  year,  was  the  occa- 
sion of  a  celebration  in  his  honor. 
At  the  beginning  of  every  month 
the  priests  ofi'ered  sacrifice  to  him 
at  twelve  altars.     He  was  invoked 
every  morning  as  the  beginner  of  a 
new  day.     Janus  opened  and  closed 
all  things.     He  sat  not  only  on  the 
confines  of  the   earth,  but  also  at 
the  gates  of  heaven.     Air,  sea  and 
land   were  in   the   hollow  of  his 
hands.     The  world  moved  on   its 
hinges    at    his    command.       The 
public  worship  of  Janus  as  a  god 
was  introduced  into  Kome  as  early 
as  the  time  of  Numa   Pompilius, 
but  a  foundation  for  its  establish- 
ment was  laid  as  early  as  the  reign 
of  Romulus.     The  story  runs  that 
the  Sabines,  having  once  made  an 
assault  on    the    newly    built  town 
of  Rome,  a  spring  of  boiling  water 
suddenly    appeared,  and    was   the 
means  of  destroying  these  enemies. 
On  this  spot  a  temple  was  erected 
in   honor   of   Janus,   the  gates  of 
which  stood  open  so  long  as  Rome 
was  at  war,  and  were  closed  with 
great  ceremony  and  rejoicing  only 
in  times  of  general  peace.     Rome 
was,  however,  so  continually   en- 
gaged in    war   that  in   the  course 
of  the  first   seven    hundred  years 
after   the   foundation  of  the  city 
the  gates  of  the  temple  were  closed 
only  three  times— in  the  reign  of 
Numa    Pompilius,    after   the  first 
Punic  war,  and   during   the  reign 
of  Augustus.      Hence  the  temple 
of  Janus  with  its  gates  shut  came 
to  be  a  very  emphatic  symbol  of 
peace,  17,  342,

vide them  into  two  classes:  The 
Lares,  or  the  souls  of  good  men,  and 
the  Larvse,  or  the  souls  of  wicked 
men.  But  the  common  idea  was 
that  the  Lemures  and  Larvae  were 
the  same.  They  were  said  to  wan- 
der about  at  night  as  spectres,  and 
to  torment  and  frighten  the  living. 
In  order  to  propltnite  them  the 
Romans  celebrated  the  festival  of 
the  Lemnralia  or  Lemuria.

tion or  carelessness.  The  Litfe 
were  supposed  to  be  daughters  of

Lo'ki,  the  Satan  of  Norse  mythology, 
dwelt  in  the  laud  of  the  dead.  He 
was  the  son  of  the  giant  Farbauti, 
whose  duty  it  was  to  ferry  the  dead 
over  the  waters  of  the  lower  world. 
Loki  had  three  children  as  cruel 
and  hateful  as  he  himself  was  full 
of  mischief.  One  was  the  huge  wolf 
Fenris,  who,  at  the  last  day,  shall 
hurry  gaping  to  the  scene  of  battle, 
with  his  lower  jaw  scraping  the 
earth  and  his  nose  scraping  the 
sky  !  The  second  was  the  serpent 
of  Midgard— the  serpent  which 
Odin  threw  into  the  sea,  where  the 
monster  grew  to  such  length  that 
it  embraced  the  whole  world  in  its 
folds.  The  third  was  the  goddess 
Hela.  420,  422,  423,  424,  428,  430,

of  the  Ethiopians,  and  came  to  the 
assistance  of  Priam  towards  the 
end  of  the  Trojan  war.  He  wore 
armor  made  for  him  by  Vulcan  at 
the  request  of  his  mother.  He 
slew  Antilochus,  the  son  of  Nestor, 
but  was  himself  slain  by  Achilles 
after  a  long  and  fierce  combat.

sank.  To  soothe  the  grief  of  his 
mother,  he  conferred  immortality

upon  Memnon,  and  caused  a  num- 
ber of  birds  to  issue  out  of  the 
funeral  pile,  which  fought  over  the 
ashes  of  the  hero.  These  birds 
were  called  Memnonides,  and  were 
said  to  have  visited  every  year  the 
tomb  of  the  hero  on  the  Hellespont. 
The  Greeks  gave  tlie  name  of  Mem- 
nonia  to  certain  very  ancient  build- 
ings and  monuments  which  they 
supposed  to  have  been  erected  by 
or  in  honor  of  Memnon.  Of  these 
the  most  celebrated  was  a  great 
temple  of  Thebes,  behind  which 
was  a  colossal  statue  (called  tlie 
statue  of  Memnon),  which,  when 
struck  by  the  first  rays  of  the  ris- 
ing sun,  was  said  to  give  forth  a 
sound  like  the  snapping  asunder 
of  a  chord.  It  appears,  however, 
that  tlie  statue  represented  in  real- 
ity  the  Egvptian  king  Amenophis,

Moly,  301. 

Mo'mus  was  a  deity  whose  delight 
and  occupation  was  to  jeer  bitterly 
at  the  actions  both  of  gods  and  men, 
sparing  no  one  with  his  insinua- 
tions except  Aphrodite,  in  whom  he 
could  find  nothing  to  blame,  and 
vexed  himself  to  death  in  conse- 
quence. As  an  example  of  his  beha- 
vior, it  is  said  that  he  complained 
of  the  man  that  Prometheus  had 
made,  because  there  was  not  a  win- 
dow in  his  breast  through  which 
his  thoughts  might  be  seen,  14.

Mors,  the  god  of  death,  was  a  son  of 
Night  and  twin-brother  of  Sleep. 
He  was,  however,  also  described  as 
a  son  of  Earth  and  Tartarus,  to 
whom  it  was  his  office  to  introduce, 
some  time  or  other,  the  whole  of 
mankind.  The  relentless  severity 
with  which  he  discharged  the  task 
caused  him  to  be  frequently  regard- 
ed with  pain,  and  to  be  repre- 
sented as  of  a  powerful  figure,  with 
shaggy  beard  and  fierce  coun- 
tenance, with  great  wings  to  his 
shoulders,  and  resembling,  on  the 
whole,  the  figure  of  Boreas,  the  god 
of  the  wild  north  wind  of  winter.

Neith,  who  was  said  to  be  the  god-

not  slain  by  Hercules,  la  his  early

part  in  the  fight  of  the  Lapithw 
against  the  Centaurs,  and  he  is 
mentioned  among  the  Calydonian

Ni'be-lun' gen-Lied.  The  Volsunsa 
Suffa  and  Nibelungeu-Lied  hardly 
differ  in  anything  but  the  name. 
The  one  is  merely  the  Norse,  the 
other  the  German,  form  of  one  and 
the  same  Nature-myth  or  epic.  Ac- 
cording to  the  "Solar  myth"  theor- 
ists, this  epic  serves  the  comm<in 
purpose  of  all  Aryan  nations:  in 
India  as  Ramayana  and  Mahab- 
harata;  in  Greece  as  the  Iliad  and 
the  Odyssey ;  in  our  more  northern 
lands  as  the  Tale  of  the  Volsungs, 
and  the  Nibelungen  Lay;  and  in 
England  as  the  tale  of  King  Arthur 
and  his  Knights  of  the  Round 
Table.  Sigurd  was  taught  in  all 
the  arts  and  sciences  by  Regin,  the 
cunning  blacksmith,  who  was  also 
the  brother  of  the  otter  killed  by 
Odin,  and  the  serpent — or  worm— 
Fafnir,  who  guarded  those  golden 
treasures  which,according  to  the  So- 
lar theory,mean  the  gladdening  and 
revivifying  sunlight,  Fafnir  him- 
self being  the  evil  power,  the  cloud, 
or  the  darkness,  which  steals  the 
light.  Regin  wished  to  secure  the 
treasure  for  himself,  and  forged  a 
sword  for  Sigurd  to  slay  the  worm 
with.  But  it  shivered  into  pieces 
on  its  very  first  trial;  and  Sigurd, 
in  contempt  at  Regin's  smithing, 
procures  the  fragments  of  his  pa- 
ternal sword  Gram,  and  Regin 
welds  them  together.  Gram  stood 
every  test.  Sigurd  drove  it,  right 
to  the  hilt,  into  Regin's  anvil;  and 
after  that,  a  lock  of  wool,  borne  01

the  surface  of  the  stream,  divided 
into  two  against  the  motionless 
edge.  Sigurd  slew  Fafnir,  and 
procured  the  treasure;  and  next  he 
slew  Regin,  who  wished  to  possess 
the  whole  of  the  prize  on  the  plea 
that  his  forging  of  the  weapon  had 
really  won  the  victory.  After  that 
Sigurd  went  to  free  the  Valkyrie 
Brynhild,  according  to  the  Solar 
myth  the  Maiden  of  Spring,  for 
whom  the  cold  earth  is  longing. 
Brynhild  lay  in  thesleep  into  which 
she  had  been  thrown  by  the  thorn  of 
Odin — that  is,  by  the  thorn,  or  cold. 
or  frost  of  winter.  Brynhild  had 
sworn  to  marry  only  the  man  who 
could  ride  through  the  fire  which 
surrounded  her  dwelling.  This 
Guunar  could  not  do;  but  Sigurd 
did  it  in  Gunnar's  shape,  where- 
upon Brynhild  agreed  to  marry 
Guunar.  But  Gudrun,  in  her  tri- 
umph, revealed  tbe  secret,  and 
compassed  the  death  of  Sigurd. 
Next,  Gudrun,  also  grieving  for 
Sigurd,  leaves  her  home;  but  she 
marries  Atli,  king  of  Hunland.  It 
would  seem  that  this  Atli  must  be 
another  name  for  the  powers  of 
darkness,  for  he  invited  his  wife's 
brother  to  his  court,  in  order  that 
he  might  seize  the  golden  treasure, 
"the  sunlight,"  which  they  had  re- 
ceived from  the  dead  Sigurd.  These 
treasures  the  brothers  buried  in  the 
Rhine  river,  and  went  on  their  way 
to  Hunland,  though  they  well  knew 
they  were  destined  never  to  return,

games  were  celebrated.  In  this 
plain  was  the  sacred  grove  of  Zeus 
called  Altis.  The  Altis  and  its  im-

0700  feet,  and  its  chief  summit  is 
covered  with  perpetual  snow.  lu 
the  Greek  mytholojiy,  Olympus 
was  the  residence  of  the  dynasty 
of  gods  of  which  Zius  was  the 
head,  Tlie  early  poets  believed 
that  the  gods  actually  lived  on  the 
top  of  this  mountain.  Even  the  fa- 
ble of  the  giants  scaling  heaven 
must  be  understood  in  a  literal 
sense;  not  that  thej'  jilaced  Pelion 
and  Ossa  upon  the  top  of  Olympus  to 
reach  the  still  higlier  heaven,  but 
that  they  piled  Pelion  on  the  top 
of  Ossa,  and  both  on  the  lower  slopes 
of  Olympus,  to  scale  the  summit  of 
Olympus  itself,  the  abode  of  the 
gods.  Homer  describes  the  gods  as 
having  their  several  palaces  on  the 
summit  of  Olympus;  as  spending 
the  day  in  the  palace  of  Zeus,  round 
whom  they  sit  iu  solemn  conclave, 
while  the  younger  gods  dance  be- 
fore them,  and  the  Muses  entertain 
them  with  the  lyre  and  song.  They 
are  shut  out  from  the  view  of  men 
upon  the  earth  by  a  wall  of  clouds, 
the  gates  of  which  are  kept  by  the 
Hours.  Iq  the  later  poets,  how- 
ever, the  real  abode  of  the  gods  is 
transferred  from  the  summit  of 
Olympus  to  the  vault  of  heaven,

Orphic  Poems.  Many  poems  ascribed 
to  Orpheus  were  current  in  the 
flourishing  period  of  Greek  litera- 
ture; but  the  extant  poems  bearing 
the  name  of  Orpheus  are  the  for- 
geries of  Christian  grammarians 
and  philosophers  of  the  Alexan- 
drian school,  though  among  the 
fragments  which  form  a  part  of  the 
collection  are  some  genuine  re-

to  the  earlier  Greek  writers.

specially  applied  to  an  ancient  im- 
age of  this  goddess  at  Troy,  on  the 
preservation  of  which  the  safety

stolen  by  Ulysses  and  Diomedes,

contained  two  Palladia,  one  of 
which  was  carried  olf  by  Ulysses

conveyed  by  iEneas  to  Italy.

brought  to  Italy  was  the  genuine 
image.  But  this  twofold  Palladium

dered his  half-brother  Phocus,  ho 
was  expelled,  and  went  to  Phthia, 
in  Thessaly.  Here  he  was  purified 
from  the  murder  by  Eurytion,  the 
son  of  Actor,  who  gave  Peleus  his 
daughter  Antigone  in  marriage, 
and  a  third  part  of  his  kingdom. 
i*eleus  accompanied  Eurytion  to 
the  Calydonian  hunt;  but  liaving 
involuntarily  killed  his  tather-in- 
law  with  hib  spear,  he  became  a 
wanderer  a  second  time.  He  now 
took  refuge  at  lolcus,  where  he  was 
again  purified  bv  Acastus,  the  king 
of  ♦^^he  place.  Here  he  was  falsely 
accused  by  Astydamia,  the  wife  of 


Acastus,  and  in  conseqdence  nearN 
perished  on  Mount  Pel  ion  (Acas- 
tus). While  on  Mount  Pelion, 
Peleus  married  the  Nereid  Tiietis. 
She  was  destined  to  marry  a  mortal, 
but  having  the  power,  like  Proteus, 
of  assuming  any  form  she  pleased, 
she  endeavored  in  this  way  to  es- 
cape from  Peleus.  The  latter, 
however,  previously  taught  by 
Chiron,  held  the  goddess  fast  till 
she  promised  to  marry  him.  The 
gods  took  part  in  the  marriage 
solemnity,  and  Eris,  or  Strife,  was 
the  only  goddess  who  was  not  in- 
vited to  the  nuptials.  By  Thetis 
Peleus  became  the  father  oi 
Achilles.  Peleus  was  too  old  to 
accompany  Achilles  against  Troy; 
he  remained  at  home,  and  survive(i

that  the  woodpecker  is  a  prophetic

Pi-rith'o-us,  son  of  Ixion  and  Dia, 
and  king  of  the  Lapithse  in  Thes-

brating his  marriage  with  Hippo- 
damia,  the  intoxicated  Centaur, 
Eurytus,  carried  her  off,  and  this 
act  occasioned  the  celebrated  fight 
between  the  Centaurs  and  Lapithse, 
in  which  the  Centaurs  were  de- 
feated. Theseus,  who  was  present, 
assisted  him  in  his  battle  against 
the  Centaurs.  Hippodamia  after- 
wards died,  and  each  of  the  two 
friends  resolved  to  wed  a  daughter 
of  Zeus.  With  the  assistance  of 
Pirithous,  Theseus  carried  off  Helen 
from  Sparta.  Pirithous  was  still 
more  ambitious,  and  resolved  to 
carry  off  Persephone  (Proserpina), 
the  wife  of  the  king  of  the  lower 
world.  Theseus  would  not  desert 
his  friend  in  the  enterprise,  though 
he  knew  the  risk  which  they  ran. 
The  two  friends  accordingly  de- 
scended to  the  lower  world;  but 
they  were  seized  by  Pluto  and 
fastened  to  a  rock,  where  they  both 
remained  till  Hercules  visited  the 
lower  world.  Hercules  delivered 
Theseus,  who  had  made  the  daring 
attempt  only  to  please  his  friend; 
but  Pirithous  remained  forever  in

est legends  as  a  subject  of  Neptune, 
whose  flocks,  the  seals,  ho  teiuled. 
According  to  Homer,  he  resided  in 
the  island  of  Pharos,  at  the  distance 
of  one  day's  journoy  from  the  river 
Nile;  whereas  Virgil  places  his 
residence  in  the   island  of  Carpa- 


thos,  between  Crete  and  Rhodes. 
At  midday  Proteus  rose  from  the 
sea,  and  slept  in  the  shade  of  the 
rocks,  with  the  monsters  o^  the 
deep  lying  around  him,  Anyone 
wishing  to  learn  futurity  from  him 
was  obliged  to  catch  hold  of  him 
at  that  time;  as  soon  as  he  was 
seized  he  assumed  every  possible 
shape,  in  order  to  escape  the  neces- 
sity of  prophesying,  but  whenever 
he  saw  that  his  endeavors  were  of 
no  avail  he  resumed  his  usual  form, 
and  told  the  truth.  After  finishing 
his  prophecy  he  returned  into  the 
sea.  Homer  ascribes  to  him  a 
daughter  Idothea.  Another  set  of 
traditions  describes  Proteus  as  a 
son  of  Poseidon,  and  as  a  king  of 
Egypt,  who  had  two  sons,  Telego- 
nus  and  Polygonus  or  Tmolus,  76,

Pthah,  is  only  Kneph  under  a  new 
name;  or,  to  express  it  otherwise, 
he  represents  a  special  energy  of 
that  god.  He  is  the  creator,  or  the 
universal  life  in  action.  Jamblic- 
hus  calls  him  the  demiotirgos,  or  ar- 
tisan of  the  world ;  and  the  Greeks 
regarded  him  as  the  counterpart  of 
their  artisan  god,  Hephaestus,  or 
Vulcan.  As  the  creator  he  was 
thought  of  as  the  father  and  sov- 
ereign of  the  gods.  He  was  wor- 
shipped chiefly  in  Memphis.  He 
appears  as  a  mummy-shaped  male 
figure ;  also  as  the  pigmy-god.

sumption and  arrogance  were  so 
great  that  he  deemed  himself  equal

fices to  be  offered  to  himself;  nay, 
he  even  imitated  the  thunder  and

Sat'ur-na'li-a.  Once  a  year,  in  the 
month  of  December,  the  Romans 
held  a  festival,  called  Saturnalia, 
in  his  honor.  It  lasted  from  five 
to  seven  days,  and  was  accompanied 
byamusements  of  all  kinds.  During 
those  days  the  ordinary  distinc- 
tions between  master  and  ser- 
vant or  slave  were  done  away  with. 
No  assemblies  were  held  to  discuss 
public  affairs,  and  no  punishments 
for  crime  were  inflicted.  Servants 
or  slaves  went  about  dressed  like 
their  masters,  and  received  from 
them  costly  presents.  Children  re- 
ceived from  their  parents  or  rela- 
tives presents  of  pictures,  probably 
of  a  gaudy  type,  purchased  in  the 
street  where  the  picture-dealers 
lived.  There  was  a  temple  of 
Saturn  in  Rome,  at  the  foot  of  the 
Capitoline  Hill,  containing  a  figure 
of  him,  with  his  feet  wrapped 
round  with  pieces  of  woolen  cloth, 
which  could  only  be  removed 
during  the  festival  of  the  Saturna- 
lia.   In  one  hand  he  held  a  curved

Savitar,  an  Indian  god,  the  per- 
sonification of  the  sun.  His  name 
means  the  "  Inciter,  or  Enlivener." 
As  the  sun-god  he  is  spoken  of  as 
the  golden-eyed,  golden-tongued, 
and  golden-handed;  and  the  Hin- 
doo commentators,  in  their  absurd 
attempts  to  give  a  literal  prosaic 
explanation  of  a  highly  appropriate 
poetic  epithet,  say  that  Savitar  cut 
off  his  hand  at  a  sacrifice,  and  that 
the  priests  gave  him  a  golden  one 
instead.  Savitar  thus  corresponds 
to  the  Teutonic  god  Tyr,  whose 
hand  was  cut  oflf  by  the  wolf  Fen- 
ris.  Like  other  gods  in  the  Hindoo 
and  Norse  mythologies,  Savitar  is 
regarded  as  all-powerful.  That 
Savitar  is  a  sun-god  appears  from 
the  following  passages,  among 
many  others,  from  the  Rig- Veda: 
"He  steps  forth,  the  splendor  of 
the  sky,  the  wide-seeming,  the  far- 
shining,  the  shining  wanderer; 
surely  enlivened  by  the  sun  do 
men  go  to  tlieir  tasks  and  do  their 
work.  May  the  golden-eyed  Savi- 
tar arise  hither !"

the  country,  but  compelled  them 
on  the  Scironian  rock  to  wash  his 
feet,  and  kicked  them  into  the  sea 
while  they  were  thus  employed. 
At  the  foot  of  the  rock  there  was  a 
tortoise  which  devoured  the  bodies 
of  the  robber's  victims.  He  was 
slain  by  Theseus.

Se-mir'a-mis  and  Ninus,  the  mythi- 
cal founders  of  the  Assyrian  empire 
of  Ninus  or  Nineveh.  Ninus  was 
a  great  warrior,  who  built  the  town 
of  Ninus  or  Nineveh.  Semiramis 
was  the  daughter  of  the  fish-god- 
dess Derceto,  of  Ascalon,  in  Syria, 
by  a  Syrian  youth,  Derceto,  being 
ashamed  of  her  frailty,  made  away 
with  the  youth,  and  exposed  her 
infant  daughter;  but  the  child 
was  miraculously  preserved  by 
doves,  who  fed  her  until  she  was 
discovered  by  the  shepherds  of 
the  neighborhood.  At  the  siege  of 
Bactra,  Semiramis  planned  an  at- 
tack upon  the  citadel,  mounted  the 
walls  with  a  few  brave  followers, 
and  obtained  possession  of  the  place. 
Ninus  was  so  charmed  by  her  brav- 
ery and  beauty  that  he  resolved  to 
make  her  his  wife,  whereupon  her 
unfortunate  husband  put  an  end  to 
his  life.  By  Ninus  Semiramis  had  a 
son,  Ninyas,  and  on  the  death  of  Ni- 
nus she  succeeded  him  on  the  throne. 
She  built  numerous  cities  and 
erected  many  wonderful  buildings. 
In  Nineveh  she  erected  a  tomb  for 
her  husband  ;  she  built  the  city  of 
Babylon,  with  all  its  wonders;  and 
she  constructed  the  hanging  gar- 
dens in  Media,  of  which  later 
writers  give  us  such  strange  ac- 
counts. Besides  conquering  many 
nations  of  Asia,  she  subdued  Egypt 
and  a  great  part  of  Ethiopia,  but 
was  unsuccessful  in  an  attack  which 
she  made  upon  India.  After  a  reign 
of  42  years,  she  resigned  the  sov- 
ereignty to  her  son  Ninyas,  and  dis- 
appeared from  the  earth,  taking 
her  flight  to  heaven  in  the  form  of 
a  dove,  34.

landed  after  they  had  been  exposed 
by  Acrisius,  where  Perseus  was 
brought  up,  and  where  he  after- 
wards turned  the  inhabitants  into 
stone  with  the  Gorgou's  head,  142,

Soma.  In  some  respects  the  myth 
of  Soma  is  the  most  curious  of  all 
the  Vedic  gods.  Soma,  as  the  in- 
toxicating juice  of  the  Soma  plant, 
corresponds  to  that  mixture  of 
honey  and  blood  of  the  Quoasir 
which,  in  the  Norse  mythology, 
imparts  prolonged  life  to  the  gods. 
In  the  Rig- Veda  the  Soma  is  simi- 
larly described ;  as  also  the  process 
by  which  it  is  converted  into  in- 
toxicating liquid.  But  in  the  same 
hymns  Soma  is  also  described  as 
an  all-powerful  god.  It  is  he  who 
gives  strength  to  Indra,  and  enables 
him  to  conquer  his  eu'»"^v  Vritra, 
the  snake  of  darkness.

the  sun.  The  same  distinction  ex- 
ists between  Poseidon  and  Nereus; 
the  one  being  the  god  of  all  waters, 
and  even  a  visitor  of  Olympus,  the 
otiier  a  dweller  in  the  sea.  Surya 
is  described  as  the  husband  of  the

three  times  a  day.  and  see  who 
landed  on  the  coast.  When  the 
Argonauts  arrived  he  opposed  their 
landing,  but  unsuccessfully;  for  it 
happened  that  tiiey  were  aware  of 
the  fact  that,  though  apparently  al- 
together made  of  bronze,  he  still  had 
a  vein  reaching  from  neck  to  heel, 
and  containing  his  life-blood.  This 
vein  Poeas,  the  father  of  Philoc- 
tetes.  managed  to  hit  with  an  ar- 
row from  the  famous  bow  of  Her-

in  search  of  his  father.  A  storm  cast 
his  ship  on  the  coast  of  Ithaca,  and 
being  pressed  by  hunger,  he  began 
to  plunder  the  fields.  Ulysses  and 
Telemachus,  being  informed  of  the 
ravages  caused  by  the  stranger, 
went  out  to  fight  against  him;  but 
Telegonus  ran  Ulysses  through 
with  a  spear  which  he  had  received 
from  his  mother.

'  The  lovely  scenery  of  this  glen  is

also  celebrated  as  one  of  the  favor- 
ite haunts  of  Apollo,  who  trans- 
planted his  laurel  from  this  spot  to

earth.  The  hammer  is  said  to  have

Tro-pho'ni-us,  373. 

Troy.  The  site  of  the  original  city  of 
Troy  will  probably  never  be  posi- 
tively identified.  It  is  somewhere, 
of  course,  in  the  Troad,  a  district 
whose  boundaries  have  been  en- 
larged since  the  famous  war.  The 
Troad  is  for  the  most  part  mount- 
ainous, being  intersected  by  Mount 
Ida  and  its  branches;  the  largest 
plain  is  that  in  which  Troy  stood. 
The  chief  rivers  were  the  Satnois 
•  on  the  S.,  the  Rhodius  on  the  N., 
and  the  Scamander  and  Simois  in 
the  centre.  These  2  rivers,  so  re- 
nowned in  the  legends  of  the  Tro- 
jan war,  flow  from  2  dififerent 
points  in  the  chain  of  Mount  Ida, 
and  unite  in  the  plain  of  Troy, 
through  which  the  united  stream 
flows  N.W.,  and  falls  into  the  Hel- 
les{)ont  E.  of  the  promontory  of 
Sigeum.  The  precise  locality  of  the 
city  of  Troy,  or.  according  to  its 
genuine  Greek  name.  Ilium,  is  the 
subject  of  much  dispute.  The  most 
probable  opinion  seems  to  be  that 
which  places  the  orignal  city  in 
the  upper  part  of  the  plain,  on  a 
moderate  elevation,  at  the  foot  of 
Mount  Ida,  and  its  citadel  (called 
Pergama)  on  a  loftier  height,  al- 
most separated  from  the  city  by  a 
ravine,  and  nearly  surrounded  by 
the  Scamander.  This  city  seems 
never  to  have  been  restored  after  its 
destruction  by  the  Greeks.  Tiie 
ohronologers     assigned      diflerent 


dates  for  the  capture  of  Troy;  the 
calculation  most  generally  accepted 
placed  it  in  B.C.  1184.  Dr.  Schlie- 
mann  locates  the  site  at  Hissarlik, 
some  3  miles  from  the  Hellespont. 
He  believes  that  he  has  unearthed 
the  literal  palace  of  Priam,  257, 258,

U-NfcORN,  389. 

U-ra'ni-a,  one  of  the  Muses,  a 
daughter  of  Zeus  by  Mnemosyne. 
The  ancient  bard  Linus  is  called 
her  son  by  Apollo,  and  Hymenseus 
also  is  said  to  have  been  a  son  of 
Urania.  She  was  regarded,  as  her 
name  indicates,  as  the  Muse  cf 
Astronomy,  and  was  represented 
with  a  celestial  globe,  to  which  she 
points  with  a  small  staff",  12, 14. 

U-ra'nus  (Heaven),  sometimes  called 
a  son  and  sometimes  the  husband 
of  Gsea  (Earth).  By  Gsea,  Uranus 
became  the  father  of  Oceanus,  Cceus, 
Crius,  Hyperion,  lapetus,  Thia, 
Rhea,  Themis.  Mnemosyne,  Phoebe, 
Tethys,  Cronus;  of  the  Cyclopes — 
Brontes,  Steropes,  Arges  ;  and  of  the 
Hectatoncheires — Cottus,  Briareus, 
and  Gyes.  According  to  Cicero, 
Uranus  was  also  the  father  of  Mer- 
cury by  Dia  and  of  Venus  by 
Hemera.  Uranus  hated  his  chil- 
dren, and  immediately  after  their 
birth  he  confined  them  in  Tartarus, 
in  "onsequence  of  which  he  was 
Uf  tanned  and  dethroned  by  Cronos 
a)  .he  instigation  of  Gsea.  Out  of 
tlie  drops  of  his  blood  sprang  the 
Gigantes,  the  Melian  nymphs,  and, 
according  to  some.  Silenus.  and 
from  the  foam  gathering  around 
his  limbs  in  the  sea  sprang  Aphro< 
dite,  19.

Vesta,  daughter  of  Cronus  and  Rhea, 
was  worshipped  both  by  Greeks  and 
Romans  as  tiie  goddess  of  the  home- 
fire,  or  hearth.  She  was  the  guard- 
ian of  family  life.  In  every  public 
resort  she  had  a  sanctuary  in  the 
shape  of  a  fire;  and  when,  in  Greece, 
a  body  of  colonists  were  about  to 
emigrate,  one  of  their  chief  consid- 
erations was  t«)  take  with  them 
some  portion  of  fire  sacred  to  Hes- 
tia,  in  order  to  carry  with  them  the 
favor  of  tli(^  goddess ;  for  the  Greeks 
looked  upoti  the  state  as  a  great 
family,  vvitli  an  altar  of  Hestia  as 
its  central  point.      No  enterprise 


was  commenced  without  sacrifice 
and  prayer  at  her  altar;  and  when 
the  fire  chancted  to  be  extinguished, 
it  could  only  be  rekindled  by  a 
light  from  some  other  sanctuary. 
Her  priestesses,  six  in  number, 
were  called  vestal  virgins,  their 
duty  being  to  feed  the  sacred 
flame  of  her  temple,  and  to  pre- 
sent sacrifices  and  prayers  for  the 
welfare  of  the  state.  To  this  ofllce 
they  were  chosen  by  the  high- 
priest,  who  was  styled  Pontifex 
Maxim  us.  They  wore  robes  of 
wliite,  with  a  fillet  round  the  hair, 
and  a  veil,  additional  ornaments 
being  permitted  in  later  times.  It 
was  necessary  that  the  girls  selected 
for  this  service  siiould  be  between 
six  and  ten  years  of  age,  and  that 
they  should  take  a  vow  of  chastity, 
and  serve  in  the  temple  for  thirty 
years.  The  sacred  fire  on  the  hearth 
of  the  goddess  and  the  laurel  that 
shaded  it  were  renewed  on  the 
1st  of  March  of  each  year ;  on  the 
15fch  of  June  her  temple  was 
cleansed  and  repaired,  16, 18,  354.
