INTRODUCTION 


HE  very  brief  space  of  ten  years  has  been  sufficient  in  which  to  develo])  an  entirely 
new  type  of  American  country  house,  the  house  to  which  the  words  "stately" 
and  "sumptuous"  may  be  indifferently  applied,  with,  at  times,  a  quite  realizing  sense 
of  their  utter  inadeciuac>'.  Country  houses  we  have  always  had,  and  large  ones  too;  but  the 
great  country  house  as  it  is  now  understood  is  a  new  type  of  dwelling,  a  sumptuous  house, 
built  at  large  expense,  often  palatial  in  its  dimensions,  furnished  in  the  richest  manner,  and 
placed  on  an  estate,  perhaps  large  enough  to  admit  of  independent  farming  operations,  and  in 
most  cases  with  a  garden  which  is  an  integral  part  of  the  architectural  scheme.  The  formal 
garden,  in  which  garden  architecture  has  an  important  part  to  perform,  is  the  most  usual;  but 
the  garden  is  always  present,  even  though  a  considerable  latitude  be  permitted  in  its  design 
and  arrangement. 

It  is  a  beautiful  thing,  this  garden-love,  which  so  embellishes  the  house,  gives  it  a 
new  meaning,  adds  to  its  beauty — rationalizes,  in  a  word,  the  country  life.  It  has  opened  up 
new  fields  of  activity  to  the  landscape  designer,  and,  which  is  much  more  significant,  has 
created  new  appreciations  of  outdoor  life  and  broadened  the  vision  of  many  an  art  lover.  For 
the  garden,  finely  laid  out,  exquisitely  planted,  suitably  ornamented,  if  space  be  had,  with 
sculpture,  is  a  work  of  art,  stimulating  the  imagination,  helping  mankind  wnth  its  soft,  gentle 
beauty,  a  source  of  joy  and  of  unending  delight.  Garden  appreciation  in  itself  is  not  new, 
but  the  great,  splendid  garden,  arranged  and  planted  as  a  part  of  the  scheme  of  which  the  house 
is  itself  the  center,  has,  in  late  years,  become  so  important  a  factor  in  American  country  life  as 
to  have  fresh  significance. 

In  a  book  which,  like  the  present  one,  is  devoted  to  the  architectural  and  gardening 
features  of  some  of  the  more  notable  of  recent  American  country  houses,  it  might  be  naturally 
assumed  that  the  art  value  of  these  places — meaning  by  that  term  everything  that  helps  in 
giving  beauty — might  be  considered  as  the  single  point  of  interest;  yet,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  this 
great  new  building  energy  is  not  due  to  an  interest  in  architecture  as  architecture,  perhaps 
hardly  to  gardening  as  gardening,  but  to  an  entirely  new  conception  of  country  life,  and  a  new 
appreciation  and  realization  of  its  manifold  joys  and  pleasures.  The  movement  countryward 
is  not,  in  fine,  a  Renaissance  of  architecture,  important  as  is  the  place  architecture  takes  in  it; 


[I] 


AMERICAN     ESTATES     AND     GARDENS 

nor  is  it  a  Renaissance  of  the  gardening  art,  important  as  that  is  likewise;  btit  l)Oth  these  factors 
testify,  and  in  a  most  impressi\'e  way,  to  a  Renaissance  of  country  Hfe. 

These  great  houses  mean  not  so  much  a  hking  for  them  as  buildings,  though  it  will  be 
readily  admitted  that  their  attractions  as  places  of  residence,  with  their  luxurious  accompani- 
ments and  wealth  of  conveniences,  are  very  great,  as  a  realizing  sense  of  the  i^leasure  of  country- 
life,  of  delight  in  escape  from  the  crowded  conditions  of  cit>-  living,  and  of  an  increasing  affec- 
tion for  the  simpler  and  more  natural  life  of  the  country,  with  its  varied  si)orts  and  open-air 
activities.  That  a  palace  in  the  country  may  be  as  luxurious  as  one  m  the  city  is,  of  course, 
quite  true;  but  the  love  for  country  life,  which  is  surely  on  the  increase,  is  one  of  the  most 
remarkable  social  features  of  contemporary  American  life. 

And  to  live  in  the  country  one  must  have  a  house;  there  must  be  accessory  buildings 
also,  numerous  enough  to  meet  the  social  needs  of  each  individual  owner.  That  the  house 
may  be  a  splendid  architectural  creation,  and  its  allied  Ijuildings  handsomely  designed  as  well 
as  conveniently  planned,  follows  almost  as  a  matter  of  course.  That  the  house  needs  an 
environment  in  keeping  with  itself  is  a  further  natural  consequence,  and  the  artistic  house,  with 
its  artistic  garden  and  the  lesser  buildings,  is  planned,  arranged,  and  executed  as  an  artistic 
whole,  ministering  to  every  possible  need  and  fulfilling  every  reasonable  delight. 

We  stand  on  the  threshold  of  a  great  movement  to  the  country.  Too  long,  it  would 
seem,  have  our  best  energies  been  centered  in  the  towns.  The  old  idea  of  country  life  as  syn- 
onymous with  the  farm  no  longer  ]3re\'ails.  The  farmhouse  type  of  country  home  is  b}'  no 
means  extinct;  but  in  every  part  of  the  country  the  magnificent  new  mansions  of  the  rich  are 
putting  entirely  new  ideas  into  the  cmTcnt  conceptions  of  country  life.  The  great  country 
house  is  the  outward  visible  sign  of  this  new  movement.  It  has  called  forth  a  fine  architectural 
talent  in  its  development,  and  has  given  a  new  field  and  a  new  scope  to  architectural  activities 
in  America.

AMERICAN     ESTATES     AND     GARDENS 

terminates  in  the  valley  below,  at  the  edge  of  a  winding  and  V)eautifully  clear  lake,  and  on 
the  other  hill  of  the  slope  are  the  dense  forests  of  a  neighboring  Country  Club.  It  would  seem, 
therefore,  that  the  wild  features  of  the  landscape  must  be  always  i^reserved. 

As  one  passes  through  the  gatewa}^  and  approaches  the  house,  which  is  ])laced  on 
a  stone  terrace  with  almost  menacing  abruptness,  one  can  hardly  realize  that  scarcely  two  years 
sufficed  to  bring  the  land  immediately  around  one  to  a  fine  state  of  perfection  and  growth. 
Rows  of  cedar  trees  of  great  age  and  size,  as  may  he  seen  in  the  frontispiece  of  this  book,  have 
been  transplanted  for  the  creation  of  the  formal  ajiproach,  and  have  been  so  ably  blended 
with  the  natural  licauties  of  the  ]_)lace  as  to  form  an  integral  ])art  of  one  of  the  most 
elaborate  and  extensive  schemes  of  its  kind  ever  carried  out  in  America. 

The  driveway,  after  it  passes  through  the  gateway  and  up  the  gentle  slope,  turns  at 
the  foot  of  the  steps  abruptly  to  the  left,  and  thence  onward  to  a  level  plateau  of  considerable 
extent,  at  the  extreme  end  of  which  is  located  the  mansion  itself.  The  road  encloses  a  green- 
sward with  an  ample  water  basin,  filled  with  lilies  and  tropical  plants,  which  reaches  almost 
to  the  doorway.  On  ttn-ning  to  the  right  and  approaching  the  house  the  formal  treatment 
has  been  again  ver\-  happil}'  carried  out ;  while  on  the  left  the  natural  wildness  of  the  mountain- 
side has  been  retained  in  all  its  primitive  beaiity — a  fine  touch  of  genius  that  enhances  the 
contrast  between  nature  and  art  which  has  been  so  completely  attained  in  this  beautiful 
estate. 

The  house  is  built  of  red  brick  and  Indiana  limestone,  and  is  designed  in  the  style  of 
Louis  XIII.  It  is  two  stories  in  height,  with  a  third  story  in  the  high  pyramidal  roof.  It 
is  simple  and  stately,  the  main  doorway  being  contained  within  an  ornamental  stone  frame- 
work, supporting  a  low  pediment  carried  b}^  double  pilasters.  The  general  plan  is  rectangular, 
with  projecting  wings  at  each  end,  the  shorter  side  facing  the  entrance  roadway,  and  the  longer 
overlooking  the  valley  immediately  below  and  the  hills  beyond. 

The  spacious  interior  is  extremely  elegant,  with  reception-room,  library,  drawing-room, 
breakfast-room,  dining-room,  and  music-room  opening  out  of  the  great  central  hall.  The 
hall,  with  its  ornamental  staircase,  is  entirely  of  Caen  stone.  The  dining-room,  at  the  end  of 
the  hall,  is  paneled  throughout  with  oak  and  has  a  coffered  ceiling.  The  hangings  are  green 
and  gold,  and  the  carving  on  the  oak  is  also  gilded,  with  a  very  successful  introduction  of 
color. 

The  librarv  is  in  Italian  walnut,  and,  like  the  dining-room,  is  wholly  paneled.  The 
ceiling  is  plaster,  and  the  mantel  of  marble.  The  tone  of  the  living-room  is  gray.  This  is 
a  charming  room,  delightfully  finished  with  the  decorative  materials  taken  from  an  old  draw- 
ing-room in  Second  Avenue,  New  York,  the  ornamental  features  of  a  fine  old  New  York 
room  being  thus  utilized  in  this  modern  New  Jersey  home.  The  l)illiard-room  is  treated  in 
the  Renaissance  style  with  good  detail. 

The  upper  floors  of  the  house  are  given  over  to  bedrooms,  arranged  singly  and  en  suite, 
and  with  many  bathrooms.-    Bright,   cheerful  colors  are  used  in  the  bedrooms,   and  a  tour

"Blairsden" 

The     House     of    C.     Ledyard     Blair,     Esq.,     Bernardsville,     New    Jersey 


HE  building  of  a  large  house  means  very  much  more  than  the  incurring  of  a  great 
expenditure.  Costliness  is,  indeed,  an  essential  element  in  all  large  building  enter- 
prises— an  element  unavoidably  entailed  by  the  very  extent  of  the  building  operation. 
And  a  great  house  in  the  country,  destined  for  the  accommodation  of  a  family  and 
the  entertainment  of  many  guests,  must  have  space  ample  and  abundant  for  every  possible 
occasion.  It  is  big,  therefore,  not  to  display  the  wealth  that  created  it,  but  because  size  is 
a  fundamental  requirement. 

A  large  house  requires  a  large  site.  There  must  not  only  be  room  to  build  upon,  but 
there  must  be  ample  grounds  for  the  proper  environing  of  the  house  with  land  that  will  give 
the  dweUing  suitable  individuality,  pleasure  grounds  for  the  inmates,  and  perhaps  a  farm  for 
their  further  delight  and  sustenance.  A  great  house  in  the  country  implies  opportunities  for 
the  enjoyment  of  rural  life  in  every  aspect,  so  that  a  large  estate  is  l)oth  a  necessity  and  a  natural 
consequence  of  the  building  of  such  houses. 

Acreage  alone  is  not  sufficient.  The  land  must  be  pleasant  to  look  upon,  with  fine  out- 
looks across  the  country,  and  perhaps  a  stream  or  lake  or  harbor  to  add  to  its  beauty.  A  beau- 
tiful site— that  is  the  desideratum  in  all  large  country  buildings,  and  very  beautiful  indeed  are 
many  of  the  places  chosen  for  the  location  of  our  great  country  houses.  The  human  element 
is  supplied  by  the  architect,  the  designing  genius  whose  part  it  is  to  create  a  house  that  will 
fit  the  site,  that  will  stand  just  where  the  house  should  stand,  and  which  shall  have  an  artistic 
outward  character  in  keeping  with  the  surroundings.  Almost  as  weighty  is  the  share  of  the 
landscape  architect,  to  whom  is  assigned  the  agreeable  task  of  beautifying  the  grounds  in  imme- 
diate contact  with  the  house,  of  designing  the  formal  garden,  of  arranging  the  walks  and  drives, 
of  giving  the  crowning  touch  of  beauty  which  welds  every  part  into  one  perfect  picture. 

Such  a  picture,  combining  in  one  splendid  whole  the  elements  that  help  in  the  making 
of  fine  American  country  places,  is  presented  by  "Blairsden,"  the  picturesquely  placed  house 
that  Mr.  Blair  has  built  on  the  steep  slope  of  one  of  the  mountains  of  Somerset  County,  near 
Bernardsville,  New  Jersey.  It  is  a  fine  house,  finely  placed  on  a  superb  site;  not,  indeed,  on 
the  summit  of  the  hill,  but,  more  wisely,  and  somewhat  after  the  Italian  manner,  on  the 
sloping  hillside,  so  that  it  may  have  the  advantage  of  the  wooded  backgrotmd  which  adds  so 
much  to  the  beauty  of  the  location.  A  rather  startling  innovation  is  the  placing  of  the  stable 
on  the  top  of  the  hill,  above  the  house,  but  it  is  so  placed  that  it  can  not  be  seen  from  the  house 
and  is  scarcely  visible   from   the    surrounding    summits.     The   wooded   slope   of   the    hillside

through  the  upper  parts  of  the  house  presents  a  succession  of  pleasant  pictures,  admirably 
arranged  for  the  comfort  and  convenience  of  the  many  guests  who  frequenth'  throng  this 
delightful  home. 

The  elevation  of  the  house  on  a  hillside,  and  the  necessary  luiilding  of  terraces  on  which 
to  support  it,  provide  some  additional  space  below  the  main  floor,  which  has  been  ])ut  to  good 
use.     Here  are  a  squash  court,  a  plunge  and  Turkish  bath,  and  Mr.  Blair's  lounging-room. 

Like  all  great  country  houses,  "Blairsden"  is  amply  provided  with  sumptuous  gardens 
and  grounds.  Viewed  from  below,  the  house  is  supported  by  a  great  stone  terrace,  with  double 
flights  of  steps.  The  space  thus  created  forms  a  species  of  o]_ien  court  l)efore  the  house,  and 
is  treated  with  lawns  and  paths,  and  decorated  with  many  bay  trees.  From  the  stone  terrace 
descend  the  great  terraced  gardens  of  the  estate,  closely  hned  with  trees  and  treated  in  a 
formal  way,  a  superb  approach,  by  which  the  traveler  on  foot  may  reach  the  house. 

At  the  farther  end  of  the  house,  from  the  entrance  doorway,  is  a  pergola  leading  to  an 
outdoor  lounging-room,  a  unique  apartment,  with  brick  walls,  open  arches,  high  wooden  roof, 
and  a  fireplace,  a  spot  not  only  agreeable  with  all  the  agreeableness  of  good  taste,  luit  from 
which  can  be  had  most  charming  views  of  the  surrounding  country.  Within,  and  behind 
the  connecting  pergola,  is  a  small  enclosed  flower  garden  court. 

The  house  is  the  center  of  a  great  estate,  with  stables,  carriage  houses,  an  automol)ile 
house,  farmhouse,  dairy,  and  other  essentials  of  a  like  nature.  Mr.  Blair  is  much  interested  in 
his  stable,  and  the  finest  possible  accommodations  have  bqen  provided  for  his  blooded  stock, 
all  of  which  are  housed  and  cared  for  in  a  state  almost  regal.

The   House  of  W.   L.   Stow,   Esq. 

Roslyn,  New  York 


|R.  STOWS  house  is  an  Italian  palace  adapted  to  the  exigencies  of  the  American 
climate.  Ver\'  large  it  is,  and  splendidly  environed,  and  best  seen  from  the  south, 
althovigh  entered  from  the  north.  It  is  a  stately  pile,  broad  and  firm  in  outline, 
simply  designed  and  sparsely  ornamented,  Init  withal  characterized  by  fine  dignity 
and  charm.  The  main  doorway,  on  the  north,  is  modest  enough,  and  is  sheltered  by  a  small 
glass  marquise  that  flares  slightly  upward. 

But  the  south  side  is  palatial,  with  an  effect  of  quite  monumental  grandeur.  Like 
man^^  Long  Island  country  places,  the  house  is  built  on  high  ground,  with  very  beautiful  natural 
surroundings.  On  the  south  it  slopes  rapidly  away  from  the  house,  falls  quickly,  indeed,  so 
that  the  terrace  treatment  is  at  once  the  most  natural  and  the  most  effective. 

And  most  happih'  this  has  been  arranged.  A  spacious  area  is  enclosed  within  a  balus- 
trade, with  a  flight  of  steps  at  each  end.  A  wonderful  space  this  is,  with  the  great  house 
immediatelv  behind,  the  steep  cliff  below,  and,  beyond,  the  rich  farming  lands  of  the  near-by 
estates,  and  farther  on,  again,  if  the  day  be  clear,  the  view  is  veiled  by  the  ocean. 

Down  below,  immediately  in  the  foreground,  is  a  second  space,  enclosed  with  a  hedge 
of  evergreens.  At  the  foot  of  each  flight  of  steps  is  a  pair  of  marble  lions,  standing  on  the 
high  pedestals  of  the  balustrade.  The  upper  terrace  is  supported  by  a  wall,  carried  wholly 
across  the  front,  the  center  marked  with  three  great  arches.  This  lower  space  is  a  simple  formal 
garden,  and  with  old  ItaUan  well-heads,  great  marble  vases,  and  other  decorative  adjuncts.  One 
can  here  realize,  if  one  has  not  reaUzed  it  before,  that  this  is  a  superb  mansion,  a  veritable  palace, 
happily  designed,  finely  placed,  and  suitably  environed.  The  greensward,  the  massive  retain- 
ing-wall  of  the  upper  terrace,  the  balustrade,  and  the  enclosing  stairways  at  the  ends,  the  house 
above,  make  an  ensemble  of  stately  beauty  that  few  American  country-  houses  possess.  The 
general  effect  is  fine,  and  the  im])ression  one  of  much  splendor. 

The  house  is  palatial  because  it  is  large,  excellently  designed,  and  handsomely  furnished. 
The  interior  is  eminently  livable  and  enjoyable.  The  rooms  are  not  vast,  as  rooms  in  houses 
of  this  rank  are  measured,  but  are  well  proportioned  to  their  uses,  and  the  spaces  have  been 
judiciously  employed.  The  main  doorway  leads  immediately  into  an  entrance  or  stair  hall 
the  full  height  of  the  house,  and  lighted  above  as  well  as  by  a  window  immediately  over  the 
door.  A  flight  of  stone  steps,  with  an  imposing  stone  balustrade,  leads  to  the  upper  floor. 
Immediatelv  in  face  is  a  monumental  doorway  to  the  hall.  This  is  a  splendid  apartment, 
the  largest  in  the  house,  occup}'ing  more  than  half  of  the  main  Imilding,  with  four  great 
windows  opening  on  to  the  south  terrace.       It  is  paneled  in  black  oak  for  two-thirds  of  its

height,  the  upper  jiart  of  the  ]_)anehng  being  treated  with  small  open  arches  supported  on  free 
columns.  Above  is  a  rich  damask  brocade  of  deep  red.  A  narrow  i)ainted  frieze  of  grotesques 
runs  around  the  room,  and  the  ceiling  is  beamed  and  painted  in  small  squares.  The  doors, 
which  arc  elaborately  framed,  as  are  the  windows,  have  rounded  to])s,  with  open  carved 
woodwork  in  the  panels.  It  is,  therefore,  a  room  rich  in  color,  and  with  a  structural  decoration 
of  quite  unusual  extent,  very  interesting  in  itself,  very  interestingly  applied,  and  thoroughly 
successful  in  its  effect.  At  the  far  end  is  a  monumental  chimneypiece,  with  fluted  columns, 
the  treasure  tro\-e  of  a  Florentine  palace,  as  are  most  of  the  chimneypieces  in  the  house. 
Electric  lights  are  hidden  behind  the  top  of  the  wall  panels,  and  produce  a  startlingly  beautiful 
effect  when  illuminated. 

To  the  right  is  the  Gold  Salon.  Here,  again,  is  more  splendor,  yet  thoroughly  harmo- 
nized and  quite  sul)dued  in  effect.  The  walls  are  hung  with  old  green  silk,  arranged  in  gilt  panels. 
The  rich  door  frame  is  also  gilt,  the  color  scheme  being  gold  and  green.  The  doorway  is  Spanish 
Renaissance.  The  mantel  is  plain,  but  beautifully  wrought;  over  it  is  a  portrait  of  the  Duchess 
of  Parma,  by  Suttermans,  in  a  rich  old  monumental  frame.  The  center  of  the  ceiHng  is  filled 
with  a  large  painting  of  the  School  of  Tiepolo,  and  the  room  is  illumined  by  crystal  lights  hanging 
from  the  walls.  Three  rooms  on  the  end  of  the  house  open  from  the  hall  and  adjoin  the  Salon. 
The  central  one  is  a  ];)illiard-room;  at  one  end  is  a  conservatory,  at  the  other  a  smoking-room. 
The  dining-room  adjoins  the  hall,  and  is  nearly  of  the  same  size.  It  is  a  large  apart, 
ment,  l)rilliantly  lighted  by  the  spacious  windows  by  day^  and  at  night  b}'  great  electric 
standards  placed  in  each  corner.  It  is  sumptuously  furnished,  and  that  many  fine  works  of 
art  enter  into  its  adornment  is  thoroughly  in  keeping  with  the  splendid  manner  in  which  the 
whole  house  has  been  planned  and  arranged.  The  floor  is  marble  mosaic.  The  door  frames 
are  of  marble,  carved  and  ornamented  with  rich  panels  and  friezes.  Marble  pilasters  mark 
off  the  division  of  the  walls,  which  are  covered  with  green  velvet  brocade.  There  is  a 
dado  of  green  and  black  marble,  and  the  same  material  appears  in  the  serving  tables  or 
sideboards,  each  of  which  is  supported  by  white  marble  pedestals.  The  ceiling,  in  green  and 
gold,  is  decorated  with  small  squares;  in  the  center  is  a  large  square  painting  by  Domenichino, 
the  "Youth  of  Bacchus";  each  of  the  four  corners  has  rotund  allegorical  panels,  painted 
by  Claudio  Francesco  Beaumont.  On  one  wall  is  a  painting  of  the  "Rape  of  the  Sabines," 
by  Vasari,  and  a  number  of  old  Italian  portraits  are  htmg  in  the  adjoining  spaces.  A  small 
breakfast-room  opens  out  of  the  dining-room;  and  then,  beyond  it,  are  the  apartments 
devoted  to  the  service,  pantries,  a  dumb-waiter  to  the  kitchen,  which  is  placed  below,  where 
there  are  more  pantries,  storerooms,  ice  chests,  servants'  dining-room,  and  other  offices,  all 
so  needful  to  the  inhabiting  of  the  house,  and  here  down  below,  but  with  their  own  opening 
to  the  outer  world,  which  the  location  of  the  house  on  a  hill  permits  most  conveniently. 

To  the  left  of  the  entrance  hall  is  the  library.  It  is  prefaced  by  a  small  recess.  .  The 
walls  are  lined  with  bookcases,  above  which  are  deep  dark  oak  panels;  the  plastered  ceiling 
is  decorated  with  geometrical  designs.     The  conspicuous  feature  of  this  room  is  the  superb

mantel  and  chimnc_\-i)iecc,  the  richest  in  the  house,  magnifieentl)-  carved  with  crowded  ixuiels 
in  rehef,  and  a  veritable  masterpiece,  brought  from  Venice.  Above  it  are  three  consoles  with 
gilt  busts.  The  fin-niture  is  chiefly  old,  and  the  walls  are  hung  with  old  portraits.  A  goodly- 
portion  of  the  bookcases  is  given  up  to  Mr.  Stow's  collection  of  old  blue  and  white  china,  which 
includes  a  number  of  pieces  of  the  highest  interest.  In  each  corner  hangs  a  large  German 
silver  lamp,  connected  with  the  electric  light. 

Upstairs  are  bedrooms,  boudoirs,  and  bathrooms.  A  great  corridor  runs  through  the 
house  froi  i  east  to  west,  opening  on  to  the  entrance  hall,  with  a  central  balcony,  whence  one 
may  look  across  at  the  tapestries  with  which  this  part  of  the  house  is  decorated.  The 
bedrooms  are  mostly  hung  with  silk  or  other  material,  all  delightfully  furnished,  and  each 
with  its  own  color  scheme  and  its  attendant  bathroom.  The  third  floor  does  not  appear  in 
the  outward  design  as  it  is  hidden  b}-  the  cornice  and  roofing;  it  is  entirely  given  up  to  the 
servants'  c^uarters.

The   House  of  P.  A.  B.  Widener,  Esq. 


Ashbourne,    Pennsylvania 


HE  magnificent  residence  of  Mr.  P.  A.  B.  Widener,  at  Ashbourne,  Pennsylvania,  is  one 
of  the  most  sumptuovis  hovises  in  the  immediate  neighborhood  of  Philadelphia.  It 
is  a  house  of  the  largest  size,  truly  palatial  in  its  dimensions,  quite  soberly  treated, 
dignified,  with  a  stately  portico  as  the  conspicuous  feature  of  the  main  front.  The 
porches,  indeed,  constitute  the  chief  external  adornment,  for  the  front  walls  are  plain,  with 
widely  spaced  pilasters,  each  panel  containing  two  windows  in  somewhat  severe  frames.  This 
motif  is  carried  wholly  around  the  house,  the  various  fronts  difiiering  only  from  the  main  front 
in  the  spacing  of  the  pilasters,  the  arrangement  of  the  windows,  and  the  size  and  shape  of  the 
porches.  A  high  balustrade  completely  surrounds  the  roof  line,  save  where  it  is  interrupted 
bv  the  entrance  portico. 

The  very  spacious  grounds  are  beautifully  developed  as  an  Italian  garden,  with  the 
architectural  accompaniments  of  retaining-walls,  steps,  balustrades,  and  other  adjuncts  which 
are  so  essential  to  gar- 
dening of  this  kind,  but 
which  are  seldom  carried 
out  on  a  scale  so  truly 
grand  as  here.  The  beau- 
tiful lawns,  the  beds  and 
banks  of  flowers,  the 
palms,  hydrangeas,  bay 
trees,  and  other  plants 
in  tubs  and  jars,  are 
arranged  in  excellent 
taste,  and  form  a  fine 
environment  for  the 
great  house  to  which 
they  belong. 

The  palatial  grandeur 
that  the  exterior  so  well 
expresses  is  richly  de- 
veloped within.  The  hall 
occupies  the  center  of 
the     house,      and     is     a  THE  HOUSE  OF  P.  A.  B.  WIDENER,  ESQ.

splendid  nxim,  thirtv-six  feet  scjuare  and  two  stories  in  heij^ht.  Tt  is  completely  built  of 
Caen  stone.  The  walls  are  divided  into  bays,  with  great  pilasters  su])porting  the  cornice  at 
the  ceiling;  Ijelow  arc  round  arched  openings  and  doors;  above  are  rectangular  windows, 
opening  into  a  gallery  that  is  carried  around  the  hall,  with  richly  chased  bronze  railings. 
The  stairway  rises  immediately  from  the  central  arch  of  the  farther  side,  and  is  continued 
within  to  the  upper  storv.  A  gigantic  Chinese  vase  supporting  a  candelabrum  stands  on  each 
side  of  the  steps.  Before  the  mantelpiece  are  busts  of  Cosmo  de'  Medici  and  his  wife,  by 
Bernini.  The  hangings  are  of  red  velvet  embroidered  with  gold,  and  in  the  center  of  the 
room  is  a  large  carved  table  supported  on  gilt  figures.  The  colors,  as  a  whole,  as  given 
by  the  hangings  and  rugs,  are  red,  white,  and  gold,  and  the  decorative  treatment  is  very 
rich  and  sumptuous. 

The  more  important  rooms  open  directly  from  the  hall.  On  the  right  are  the  reception- 
room,  billiard -room,  and  library,  the  latter  a  great  apartment,  fifty  feet  square.  On  the  left 
a  smaller  hall  leads  to  the  smoking-room  and  sitting-room,  and  to  the  dining-room  and  the 
breakfast-room.  All  of  these  rooms  are  beautifully  furnished  and  decorated.  They  are  truly 
palatial,  hospitable  in  size,  lavish  in 
their  appointments,  and  present  ex- 
cellent examples  of  present-day  tend- 
encies in  costly  dwellings.  This  is 
particularly  true  of  this  house,  for 
Mr.  Widener  gave  up  a  grand  cit}' 
mansion  that  he  had  built  for  himself, 
in  order  to  live  in  this  great  new 
house.  It  is  located  in  a  pleasant 
suburb  of  Philadelphia,  but  near 
enough  to  the  city  to  be  quite  suffi- 
ciently close  for  business  and  social 
affairs.  It  stands  just  outside  of 
built-up  Philadelphia,  in  a  lovely 
rural  neighborhood,  where  the  pleas- 
ures of  coiintry  life,  when  centered  in 
.such  a  home,  must  be  almost  unlimited. 
The  chief  room  on  the.  second 
floor  is  the  picture  gallery,  entered 
through  an  antechamber.  Here  is 
housed  one  of  the  richest  and  finest 
collections  of  paintings  in  the  United 
States.  The  collection  has  been 
formed   with   tmusual    taste   and    dis-         THE  HOUSE  OF  P.  A.  B.  wiDENER,  ESQ.— THE  HALL.

li\-ing-r()oms,  is  the  real  center  of  Mr.  Widener's  house,  and  gives  it  an  importance  and 
interest  that  few  other  great  houses  in  America  possess.

"Harbor  Hill" 

The  Estate  of  Clarence  H.  Mackay,  Esq.,  Roslyn,  New  York 

R.  MACKAY'S  house,  "Harbor  Hill,"  is  a  stately,  dignified  composition,  the  some- 
what severe  front  being  gracioush'  relieved  by  the  excellent  carving  of  the  dooi^way. 
It  is  built  of  a  pale,  delicate  gray  stone  of  delightful  tone  and  color. 

A  great,  cool  gray  hall  fills  the  center.  It  is  two  stories  in  height,  paneled 
throughout  in  oak,  with  oak  columns  and  pilasters  and  coffered  ceiling.  The  windows  opposite 
the  entrance  look  out  on  to  the  head  of  Hempstead  Bay.  The  chief  adornments  are  four  sets 
of  old  oak  choir  stalls  from  a  church  in  Europe,  exquisitely  carved  and  beatitiful  works  of  art. 
The  chimneypiece,  a  fine  old  spoil  from  a  European  palace,  is  so  huge  that  the  wood  of  a  single 
tree  can  be  burned  within  it.  The  planning  of  the  house  is  simple.  In  the  center  is  the  hall; 
at  the  entrance,  stretching  away  right  and  left,  is  a  wide  corridor,  at  the  left  end  of  which  is 
the  main  stairway — oak,  like  all  the  woodwork  in  the  open  public  parts  of  the  ground  floor,

with  a  hea\-ih-  carved  railing;  from  the  ceihng  of  the  uppermost  story  hangs  a  great  bronze 
lamp — a  late  Renaissance  masterpiece.  On  the  right  is  the  dining-room,  with  ])antries  and 
kitchen  beyond — the  latter  in  a  separate  wing — and  the  billiard-room;  on  the  left  are  the 
librar}'  and  the  white  drawing-room. 

The  library  walls  have  a  high  paneled  dado  of  polished  wood  below  a  covering  of  green 
stripes.  Rare  tapestries  cover  much  of  the  wall  space;  above  is  a  coved  cornice  pi  polished 
wood.  There  is  much  furniture  in  the  room — a  piano  in  one  corner,  a  fine  old  Ffench  table 
near  the  fireplace,  desks  and  tables,  tables  with  lamps  and  tables  with  bric-a-brac,  and 
a  veritable  garden  of  plants  and  palms.  The  whole  room  is  surrounded  with  growing  plants; 
great  garden  vases  filled  with  fine  specimens  stand  before  two  of  the  windows;  mammoth 
Boston  ferns,  palms  in  the  corners  and  by  the  windows;  and  yet  the  room  is  so  large 
that  there  is  no  sense  of  overcrowding,  and  the  plants  are  arranged  in  a  truly  decorative 
manner  and  in  exquisite  taste. 

The  white  drawing-room  is  cool  and  beautiful  in  color,  all  in  white.  Panels  of  mirrors 
fill  spaces  not  occupied  by  doors;  and  of  windows  there  are  none  at  all,  for  it  opens  into  an 
enclosed  porch,  or  conservatory,  to  which,  in  a  sense,  it  is  an  antechamber.  The  furniture  is 
white,  with  caned  seats  and  backs,  covered  with  tapestried  cushions;  two  great  jardinieres 
with  caned  sides  stand  before  the  doors  to  the  conservatory.  Over  a  console,  filling  one  of 
the  great  panels,  is  a  portrait  of  the  mistress  of  the  niansion,  a  lovely,  speaking  figure. 

The  conservatory  beyond  is  another  bower  of  flowers."  White  furniture  here  also,  with 
red  cushions;  red  carpet  in  the  center;  matting  at  the  ends;  glazed  brick  for  ceiling.  It  is 
really  an  enclosed  porch,  looking  out  on  to  an  open  porch,  with  stone  columns  and  red  bricked 
floor.  Beyond  is  the  Italian  garden;  not  as  vet,  it  is  true,  laid  out;  but  a  graceful  fountain 
fills  the  center,  and  a  row  of  statues  on  each  side  hints  what  the  immediate  foreground  will 
be  when  time  and  care  have  brought  this  portion  of  the  grounds  to  maturity. 

The  dining-room  and  billiard-room,  on  the  other  side  of  the  central  hall,  are  both  noble 
apartments,  for  there  is  a  splendid  sense  of  space  in  this  great  house;  the  rooms  are  large,  the 
windows  ample,  the  ceilings  lofty.  Each  room  has  its  individual  note  and  treatment;  the 
dining-room  is  paneled  throughout. 

An  electric  elevator  takes  one  upstairs.  Nearly  half  of  the  top  floor  is  given  up  to 
nurseries,  with  separate  rooms  for  the  children  and  their  attendants.  Very  pleasant  these 
rooms  are,  in  cool,  quiet  colors  and  fine  furnishings,  in  which  the  quality  of  appropriateness 
has  been  very  happily  caught.  All  these  apartments  are  communicating,  and  can,  at  the 
same  time,  be  completely  isolated  from  the  rest  of  the  house.  Guest  rooms,  arranged  in  pairs, 
with  a  common  bathroom,  fill  up  much  of  the  remainder  of  this  floor,  although  some  space 
for  servants  is  found  here,  together  with  storage  closets.  Mrs.  Mackay's  cedar  room  has 
special  interest. 

The  second  floor  contains  the  apartments  of  the  master  and  mistress  of  the  house, 
together  with  some  additional  guest  rooms.     The  latter  are  slightly  more  elegant  than  those

above,  but  have  the  same  ampleness  of  size  that  distinguishes  all  the  rooms  of  the  house.  Mr. 
Mackay's  rooms  consist  of  his  bedroom,  finished  in  a  cool  shade  of  green,  and  a  sitting-room, 
transformed  at  times  into  a  place  for  exercise. 

A  separate  hall  leads  to  my  lady's  apartments.  Here,  at  last,  is  the  queen's  chamber, 
the  intimate  home  of  the  active  mind  that  dominated  the  creation  of  this  palatial  residence 
and  the  vast  estate  connected  with  it.  A  great  curtain  hangs  across  the  hall,  the  farther  end 
of  which  is  enclosed  as  an  anteroom.  Like  the  other  rooms  of  this  suite,  it  is  carpeted, 
curtained,  paneled,  and  finished  in  mauve,  a  beautiful,  gentle  hue.  The  boudoir,  or  sitting-room, 
opens  immediately  from  the  anteroom;  it  is  large,  thronged  with  ftuiiiture,  curtained  and 
walled  with  my  lady's  color,  and  richly  decked  with  the  thousand  and  one  articles — choice 
pieces  of  furniture,  vases,  lamps,  pictures,  bric-a-l)rac,  books,  and,  above  all,  plants — which 
every  great  lady  finds  comforting  to  existence.  Opposite  the  doorway  is  a  canopied  couch, 
over  which  hangs  a  rich  ermine  robe — a  trulv  royal  throne  for  the  queen  that  rules  here. 


•'HARBOR  HILL"— MRS.   MACKAY'S  BATHROOM. 


[33] 


[34] 


AMERICAN     ESTATES     AND     GARDENS 

Mrs.  Mackay's  bedroom  comes  next,  and  then  the  bathroom,  with  its  famous  bath, 
chiseled  out  of  a  single  piece  of  rich  marble  and  let  into  the  floor — a  room  unlike  any 
bathroom,  with  rich  furnishings,  lamps,  easy-chairs,  tables,  and  plants. 

"Harbor  Hill"  is  no  single  country  house,  isolated  in  the  midst  of  rural  surroundings. 
It  is  the  center  of  a  vast  estate  of  five  hundred  or  six  hundred  acres,  with  many  separate 
buildings  for  the  greater  development  and  the  more  thorough  enjoyment  of  country  life.  The 
carriage  house  and  stable  is  quite  palatial,  with  magnificent  appointments  for  the  horses, 
a  special  suite  for  the  head  coachman,  and  comfortable  quarters  for  the  men.  The  farm  bam  is 
a  separate  structure,  admirably  equipped  for  the  extensive  farming  operations  carried  on  here; 
and  the  farmer's  house  is  an  old  Long  Island  farmhouse,  long  standing,  and  thoroughly 
restored  and  kept  in  fine  order.  There  are  kennels  for  the  dogs,  a  special  stable  for  the  polo 
ponies,  chicken  houses  and  duck  houses,  conservatories  and  storage  houses  for  bay  trees, 
a  dairy,  and  special  houses  for  the  men  in  charge  of  each  department. 

Yet  all  these  building  features  pale  before  the  lovely  attractiveness  of  the  woods  and 
drives.  No  less  than  ten  miles  of  bridle  paths — quite  wide  enough  for  a  carriage — traverse 
the  hills  and  valleys  of  this  lovely  estate,  in  which  both  nature  and  art  have  been  combined 
in  a  thoroughly  delightful  manner,  and  so  happily  that  the  cultivated  borders  of  the 
driveways — ^beautifully  planted  with  flowering  shrubs  and  greened  with  well-trimmed  grass — 
merge  naturally  into  the  wilder  beauty  of  the  forests  which  still  cover  much  of  the  land. 
There  is  true  wildness  in  these  woodlands,  and  Mrs.  Mackay's  own  little  rustic  cottage,  deep 
in  the  woods,  and  placed  jtist  where  the  views  across  the  cotmtry  are  finest,  is  a  tinily  wood 
retreat  from  the  more  modern  splendors  of  the  palace  on  the  hill  summit.

The  White   House 

Washington,  District  of  Columbia 


HE  White  House  is  the  one  residence  of  national  interest  in  the  United  States.  Other 
houses  may  have  greater  local  associations,  may  be  larger,  more  richly  built  and 
furnished,  may  be  more  splendid,  in  a  word,  but  no  dwelling  is  so  supreme  in  its 
attractions  to  the  people  as  a  whole,  so  richly  endowed  with  historical  interest,  or 
associated  with  so  many  notable  people,  as  the  house  of  our  Presidents,  the  one  truly  State  resi- 
dence of  our  land — the  White  House.  The  dullest  imagination  kindles  at  thought  of  it,  and 
even  the  political  opponent  of  its  occupant  for  the  time  being  views  it  with  respect  as  the  home 
of  the  head  of  our  State.  It  is  the  Nation's  house,  the  one  residence  in  the  country  of  abounding 
sentimental  interest. 

It  is  a  fortunate  and  delightful  circumstance  that  its  architectural  interest  is  also  great 
and  very  real,  a  fact  of  the  more  moment  since  the  history  of  its  building  has  not  been  altogether 
happy.  Its  original  architect  was  an  Irishman,  James  Hoban,  who  not  only  superintended 
its  construction,  but  also  its  rebuilding  in  1814,  after  it  had  been  partly  burned  by  the  British. 
A  stately  and  beautiful  house  it  was  he  planned  and  built,  and  such  it  has  since  remained.  It  was 
but  half  finished  when  first  occupied  by  Mrs.  John  Adams,  on  the  removal  of  the  seat  of  govern- 
ment from  Philadelphia  to  Washington,  in  1800.  Twenty -five  years  later  the  north  and  south 
porticoes  were  built,  although  proposed  as  early  as  1803,  by  B.  H.  Latrobe.  Terraces,  also,  were 
added  on  the  east  and  west.  The  east  terrace  disappeared  early  in  the  sixties;  the  west  terrace, 
long  since  degraded  into  a  foundation  for  greenhouses,  has  been  now  happily  removed.  Large 
sums  of  money  have,  from  time  to  time,  been  spent  on  furniture,  decorations,  and  supplies 
for  the  President's  House,  as  it  was  styled  for  fifty  years  in  the  appropriation  bills;  but  little 
of  artistic  value — of  permanent  artistic  value — went  into  the  building,  and  not  until  the  very 
complete  and  beautiful  restoration  of  Tgo2  did  the  White  House  interior  become  worthily  repre- 
sentative of  the  best  in  American  household  art.  This  latter  restoration  was  so  skilfully  done 
and  was  so  very  thorough,  including  as  it  did  both  structural  and  decorative  changes,  the  rebuild- 
ing of  the  terraces,  which  were  originally  intended  to  form  a  component  part  of  the  building, 
and  the  erection  of  an  office  building,  that  permitted  the  house  to  be  used,  as  it  surely  should 
only  have  been  used,  as  a  residence,  that  the  names  of  the  architects,  McKim,  Mead  &  White, 
are  clearly  entitled  to  be  joined  with  that  of  the  original  creator,  James  Hoban. 

Judged  by  the  standards  of  European  palaces — and  the  White  House,  from  its  official 
use,  is  the  only  building  we  have  that  may  be  properly  compared  with  them — it  is  not  large; 
but  it  is  a  building  of  extraordinary  beauty  and  dignity,  a  restful  and  altogether  satisfying

exterior,  of  which  it  is  hardly  too  much  to  say  it  has  no  rival  in  stateliness  of  efifect  and  simple 
loveliness  among  the  great  mansions  of  America.  The  straight  lines  of  its  fronts  are  broken 
only  b}'  the  semicircular  swelling  of  the  south  front,  enclosed  with  a  gracious  colonnade  of 
similar  form,  and  the  great  portico  of  the  north  front,  which  serves  as  a  porte-cochere  as  well 
as  for  visitors  arriving  on  foot.  Since  the  recent  restoration  a  new  entrance  has  been  added 
to  the  end  of  the  east  terrace,  where  guests  alight  under  a  spacious  porte-cochere,  and  enter 
a  corridor  formed  by  the  terrace,  with  boxes  for  wraps  and  dressing-rooms  in  the  main  building, 
and  where  a  stairway  conducts  them  to  the  main  floor.  This  arrangement  has  simplified  the 
handling  of  the  great  crowds  that  throng  the  White  House  at  receptions  and  on  other  festival 
occasions ;  for  more  than  any  other  house  in  America  this  building  is  the  scene  of  great  functions, 
bringing  together  immense  numbers  of  people,  that  call  for  broad  passages  for  their  coming  and 
going,  and  enormous  rooms  for  their  entertainment. 

The  famous  screen  of  colored  glass,  placed  by  President  Arthur  between  the  vestibule 
and  the  main  corridor,  has  been  removed,  and  six  white  marble  columns,  grouped  in  pairs, 
substituted  for  it.  The  keynote  of  the  interior  is  thus  set  by  the  pure  Colonial  treatment 
of  the  vestibule  and  the  main  corridor,  the  latter  with  pilastered  walls  and  round  arched  niches, 
with  electric  light  standards  of  beautiful  design.  The  walls  are  painted  Colonial  yellow,  and 
a  dull  red  carpet  is  laid  on  the  center  of  the  stone  floor.

The  East  Room — ^unquestionably  the  most  famous  room  in  America — is  entered  by  the 
new  stairs  from  the  lower  hall  at  its  north  end.  It  is  a  magnificent  apartment,  eighty  feet  long, 
forty  feet  wide,  and  twenty -two  feet  in  height.  The  walls  are  paneled  throughout  with  wood, 
save  for  a  base  of  red  Numidian  marble,  the  panels  being  enclosed  between  pilasters  supporting 
a  finely  modeled  cornice.  Over  the  doors  and  above  the  panels  are  sculptured  reliefs — twelve 
in  all — illustrating  ^^sop's  fables.  The  woodwork  is  wholly  in  white,  with  a  high  enamel  finish; 
the  four  mantels  are  of  richly  colored  marble,  and  the  curtains  and  hangings  are  of  yellow. 
The  floor  is  superbly  polished,  and  the  ceiling,  from  which  hang  three  immense  crystal  chan- 
deliers, is  delicately  enriched  with  finely  modeled  ornament.  Low  stools,  covered  with  the  same 
rich  material  that  is  used  for  the  hangings,  are  aiTanged  around  the  walls.  It  is  a  spacious 
and  magnificent  room,  very  beautifully  detailed,  and  arranged  with  exquisite  taste. 

The  State  Dining-Room  is  at  the  opposite  end  of  the  corridor,  at  the  west  end  of  the 
building.  Its  original  area  has  been  extended  by  including  within  it  the  western  end  of  the 
main  hall.  It  is  now  large  enough  to  accommodate  a  hundred  persons  at  table.  Above 
a  marble  base  the  walls  are  finished  with  a  superb  paneling  of  beautifully  grained  English  oak, 
enclosed  within  pilasters  of  the  same  rich  wood.  Splendid  Flemish  tapestries,  illustrating  the 
"Eclogues"  of  Virgil,  hang  against  the  wall,  and  to  the  cornice  are  fastened  fine  heads  of  deer, 
moose,  and  other  American  animals.  The  mantel  is  of  white  marble,  the  curtains  of  rich  green 
velvet,  the  ceihng,  in  white,  is  beautifully  detailed,  and  the  floor  is  of  polished  marquetry. 
Three  other  rooms  along  the  back  of  the  house  complete  the  State  suite.  Adjoining  the 
State  Dining-Room  is  the  Red  Room,  which,  like  the  other  two,  takes  its  name  from  its  prevail- 
ing color.  Its  walls  are  covered  with  rich  red  velvet.  The  mantel  is  from  the  State  Dining- 
Room.  Many  portraits,  which  formerly  hung  in  the  corridor  and  the  East  Room,  are  placed 
here.  The  Blue  Room  is  oval  in  form,  and  is  one  of  the  most  exquisitely  proportioned  rooms 
in  America.  Its  walls  are  hung  with  steel  l)lue  ribbed  silk,  embroidered  at  the  ceiling  and 
above  the  wainscot  with  the  Greek  fret  in  yellow  silk.  The  windows  have  heavy  curtains, 
with  a  gilded  eagle  over  the  center  of  each.  The  marble  mantel  is  supported  by  sheaves  of 
arrows  tipped  with  gilt  bronze.  This  room  is  used  by  the  President  for  official  receptions, 
and  its  form  and  decorations  are  admirably  adapted  to  ceremonial  occasions.  The  Green 
Room,  which  adjoins  it  on  the  other  side,  is  hung  in  velvet  with  a  silvery  sheen,  and,  like  the 
Red  Room,  contains  a  number  of  portraits.  The  mantel  formerly  stood  in  the  State  Dining- 
Room.  The  private  dining-room,  which  adjoins  the  State  Dining-Room,  has  ctirtains  of  red 
velvet.     The  domed  ceiling,  like  the  other  ceilings  in  the  house,  is  white. 

A  stone  stairway  near  the  main  entrance  of  the  East  Room  leads  to  the  upper  floor, 
which  is  now  wholly  given  up  to  the  family  life.  The  old  Cabinet  Room  is  now  used  by  the 
President  as  his  workroom,  and  is  an  apartment  rich  in  historic  memories.  The  former  offices 
have  been  transformed  into  bedrooms,  and,  almost  for  the  first  time  in  its  history,  the  White 
House  has  been  completely  adapted  to  its  proi)er  uses,  and  is  now  a  State  residence,  with  ample 
and  handsome  rooms  for  State  functions,  and  quite  sufficient  space  for  the  accommodation  of 
a  large  Presidential  family.

The  House  of  Herman  B.  Duryea,  Esq. 


Old  Westbury,  New  York 


R.  DURYEA'S  house  at  Old  Westbury,  Long  Island,  is  a  striking  structure,  built 
in  the  pleasant  woods  for  which  the  neighborhood  is  famous.  It  is  placed  on  the 
slope  of  a  hill,  the  entrance  part  in  three  stories,  the  garden  part  in  two  stories.  It 
has  a  striking  exterior  of  white  stucco,  the  somewhat  severe  front  lieing  relieved 
by  an  ornamental  centerpiece  and  balconies  in  the  second  story.  The  garden  front  is  much 
freer  in  treatment — is,  in  fact,  a  festal  composition  of  quite  unusual  charm.  Two  wings  extend 
from  the  main  building,  and  end  in  open  rooms,  or  porches,  with  trellised  arches  and  walls.  Above 
each  window  in  the  wings  is  a  sculptured  relief,  emblem  of  the  ornamental  character  of  the  rooms 
within.  A  columned  center  em- 
phasizes the  middle  of  the  main 
building,  and  above,  behind  a 
balustrade,  is  the  oval  exterior 
of  the  hall. 

The  location  of  the  house 
on  the  hillside,  and  the  attend- 
ant fact  that  the  front  portion 
has  a  lower  story  which  does 
not  appear  in  the  rear,  are  dis- 
tinguishing characteristics  which 
vitally  affect  the  plan,  and  make 
the  interior  one  of  most  un- 
usual interest.  The  halls  and 
corridors  are  its  most  striking 
features,  and  are  arranged  and 
developed  in  a  very  original 
way.  The  entrance  hall  is 

square,  the  pilastered  walls  of 
pink  Caen  stone.  Steps  be- 
tween a  screen  of  Doric  columns 
lead  to  a  corridor  connecting 
with  a  suite  of  bedrooms  on 
the  right,  and  with  the  service  view  of  the  garden  from  the  loggia.

department  on  the  left.  Two  curved  stairways,  one  on  each  side,  are  the  ai)])roaches  to 
the  upper  hall,  which  is  the  center  of  the  house — the  point  to  which  everything  radiates  and 
by  which  the  plan  is  dominated.  It  is  a  splendid  and  surprising  room,  oval  in  form,  two  stories 
in  height,  lighted  by  windows  in  the  outer  wall,  and  by  others  in  the  upper  floor,  from  which 
a  flood  of  sunshine  is  thrown  across  the  balcony  that  runs  entirely  around  it.  The  whole  of  the 
lower  hall  is  in  pink  Caen  stone,  the  upper  in  white  Caen  stone;  while  the  upper  arches, 
which  complete  the  inner  circle  of  the  upper  windows,  afford  glimpses  of  Caen  stone  columns, 
still  higher  up,  that  support  the  ceiling  of  the  upper  corridor.  It  is  a  brilliant  conception, 
carried  out  in  a  brilliant  way.  The  architectural  parts  are  beautifully  refined,  and  while 
entirely  adequate  are  carefully  subordinated  and  subdued.  The  main  arches  of  the  lower  hall 
are  elliptical  in  form,  and  without  mouldings;    the  smaller  round  arches  over  the  doorways  in

the  cornei-s  are  slightly  molded.  The  walls  are  injsticated,  the  arches  being  upheld  on 
pilasters,  which  appear  again  in  the  upper  floor  to  support  the  plaster  ceiling.  The  floor,  as  are 
the  floors  of  all  the  lower  halls,  is  of  red  brick. 

A  corridor  runs  at  right  angles  through  the  house,  cutting  the  central  oval.  To  the  left 
it  connects  with  the  dining-room;  to  the  right  it  opens  into  the  drawing-room.  It  is  decorated 
with  superb  tapestries. 

The  drawing-room  and  dining-room  each  completely  fills  a  wing  of  its  own,  which  is 
joined  at  right  angles  to  the  main  building.  The  drawing-room  is  paneled  in  pearl.  Great 
panels  of  red  damask,  curtains  of  the  same  brilliant  color,  and  furniture  from  Battle  Abbey 
in  red  and  gold,  give  the  dominant  color.  The  fireplace  is  of  yellow  marble,  with  a  paneled 
overmantel  and  a  rare  old  mirror.         The  lights  are  beautiful  girandoles  of  striking  beauty

and  originality.  The  end  opens  into  the  outdoor  room,  which  is  continuous  with  the  house  wall 
and  covered  by  the  same  roof.  It  has  a  bricked  floor  and  a  beamed  ceiling,  and  its  arches 
look  out  upon  the  beautiful  formal  garden. 

The  dining-room,  which  occupies  the  space  corresponding  to  the  drawing-room  on  the 
left  of  the  oval  hall,  is  paneled  throughout  in  Italian  walnut,  with  pilasters  at  the  windows  and 
doors,  all  very  beautiful  in  color.  The  ceiling  is  elliptical  and  perfectly  plain.  The  lights  are 
girandoles.  There  is  no  mantel,  but  an  English  stone  fireplace.  Above  it  hangs  a  portrait  of 
Mrs.  Duryea,  by  John  W.  Alexander.  An  open-air  room,  identical  with  that  at  the  end  of  the 
drawing-room,  opens  from  the  dining-room. 

The  oval  hall,  for  its  part,  provides  space  for  two  corner  rooms,  irregtilar  in  shape,  which 
are  used  as  sitting-rooms.  One  is  especially  set  apart  for  the  use  of  Mr.  Duryea.  It  has  dark 
green  walls,  on  which  are  many  old  colored  prints  and  other  sporting  mementos.  The  mantel 
is  of  green  marble,  and  the  furniture  of  the  same  color.  The  other  room  is  paneled  in  two 
shades  of  gray.  The  curtains  are  red,  with  embroidered  borders.  The  mantel  is  an  old  carved 
one,  with  an  old  mirror  over  it. 

A  flight  of  marble  steps  leads  from  the  center  of  the  oval  hall  to  the  upper  corridor, 
which  opens  into  it.  Here  are  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Duryea's  rooms,  the  latter  a  large  room,  with 
a  boudoir  adjoining  it  in  the  corner  of  the  house.  All  these  apartments  are  delightfully  furnished, 
each  with  its  own  scheme  of  harmonious  decoration  and  its  own  special  color.  More  stairs 
lead  to  the  upper  third  story,  the  corridor  here  forming  a  picture  gallery.  The  rooms  are 
entirely  set  apart  for  guests,  and  are  arranged  en  suite  with  bathrooms.  Each  is  furnished  in 
chintz,  vei-y  beautiful  in  color  and  delightfully  varied. 

The  space  immediately  without  the  house  at  the  back  forms  the  formal  garden.  In  the 
center,  between  the  drawing-room  and  the  dining-room,  is  a  long  pool,  with  a  fountain  at  one 
end.  At  the  farthest  extremity  this  garden  is  enclosed  with  high  trellises  of  wood,  painted 
green,  with  a  high  niche  of  the  same  material  directly  opposite  the  two  ends  of  the  wings. 
BrilHant  beds  of  flowers  surround  the  house  and  enclose  the  trellises.  From  each  side  extend 
two  broad  grassed  walks,  bounded  with  privet  hedges,  beyond  which  are  solemn  rows  of  cypress. 
These  are  beautiful  stretches  of  green  grass,  reaching  off  on  the  one  side  to  the  trees,  and  on 
the  other  to  a  roadway.  Behind  the  enclosing  trellises  is  a  thick  wood,  which  spreads  away 
in  all  directions,  the  whole  house,  both  front  and  back,  being  set  in  the  woods,  which  have  been 
cleared  away  somewhat  in  its  imrnediate  vicinity. 

The  house  presents  a  brilliant  exterior  as  seen  from  the  garden,  the  exterior  of  a  bviilding 
quite  palatial  in  scale  and  palatial  in  expression.  Every  single  feature,  the  decorated  walls, 
the  delightful  end  porches,  the  novel  trellises,  the  water  garden  in  the  center,  the  blooming 
plants  and  vines,  all  help  in  creating  an  ensemble  of  very  great  charm  and  interest.

"Indian  Harbor" 

The  House  of  E.  C.  Benedict,  Esq.,  Indian  Harbor,  Greenwich,  Connecticut 


[IVEN  an  irregular  piece  of  land,  jutting  out  into  the  waters  of  Long  Island  Sound — 
a  veritable  peninsula — a  liberal  appropriation  of  money  for  buildings  and  a  garden, 
a  fine  taste  and  vast  enthusiasm  on  the  part  of  the  architects,  and  there  is  no  wonder 
at  all  that  Mr.  E.  C.  Benedict's  house  at  Indian  Harbor  is  one  of  the  most  beautiful 
country  houses  in  America.  The  irregular  shores  of  Connecticut  contain  many  fine  sites  for 
handsome  homes,  but  the  whole  coast  contains  nothing  more  picturesque  than  Indian  Harbor, 
an  irregularly  shaped  rock  that  runs  out  so  far  into  the  water  as  to  take  the  house  quite  beyond 
the  limits  of  the  mainland.  It  is  a  wonderful  situation,  a  scene  of  utmost  peace  and  charm; 
and  the  great  house  built  here  is,  with  its  subsidiary  buildings,  one  of  the  finest  residences  in 
America. 

It  is  a  veritable  palace,  a  house  of  great  size,  built  so  far  out  on  its  rock  as  to  be  prac- 
tically surrounded  on  three  sides  by  the  waters  of  the  Sound.      It  is  approached  by  a  curving 
driveway  that  presently  enters  a  formal  treatment  of  its  bordering  land.     Immediately  to  the 
left  is  the  house  of  Mr.  Frank  S. 
Hastings,  Mr.  Benedict's  secre- 
tary,   itself    a    fine    and   beau- 
tiful    dwelling    rising     directly 
above  the  water,  and  connected 
with  Mr.  Benedict's  own  house 
by     a     stately     pergola,     built 
directly  above  the  wall  which 
skirts     the     land,     and     which 
rises    in    steps    to    the    higher 
level     on     which     the     greater 
house  is  built. 

And  very  splendid  this 
mansion  is,  designed  in  a  pure 
Italian  stjde,  a  stately  Italian 
palace  built  on  this  quiet  New 
England  shore,  whose  rocky 
surface  has  been  transformed 
into  a  superb  formal  garden  in

complete  keeping  with  the  monumental  character  of  the  dwelling.  The  house  is  white,  quite 
elaborated  in  its  structural  parts,  its  blocked  and  pilastered  walls,  stately  arches,  finely 
proportioned  columns,  and  quite  abundant  use  of  the  balustrade.  Carving  in  relief  is  sparsely 
used,  Init  when  employed  it  is  introduced  in  a  thoroughly  legitimate  manner  to  properly 
adorn  and  embellish  the  architectural  features.  It  is  a  majestic  and  impressive  building, 
rising  alwve  the  water  like  a  dream-palace.  But  it  is  very  real,  built  solidly  upon  a  rock, 
vast  in  size,  so  beautifully  environed  as  to  immediately  give  the  impression  of  being  an  ideal 
residence  on  an  ideal  site. 

The  chief  entrance,  which  faces  the  drive  by  which  the  estate  is  entered,  is  one  of  real 
grandeur.  A  monumental  flight  of  steps  rises  in  the  center  to  the  opening  in  the  porte-cochere. 
Handsome  balustrades  on  either  side  enclose  sunken  gardens,  and  bound  the  roadway,  which 
rises  to  the  level  of  the  main  floor,  where  guests  dismount  beneath  a  porch  which  is  an  integral 
part  of  the  house  design.  The  roof  of  this  porch  forms  a  terrace,  very  broad  and  stately,  with 
an  inner  part  covered  by  a  high  central  arch  supported  on  coupled  columns,  with  outer  columns 
against  the  end  piers.  A  very  gracious  motif  this,  with  the  circular  pierced  windows  in  the 
ends  over  the  flat-topped  openings,  a  truly  Italian  frontispiece,  very  happily  used  and  very 
successful  as  the  chief  feature,  the  predominating  note,  of  the  exterior. 

The  house  is  L-shaped,  with  a  great  wing  on  the  right,  completely  filled  with  the  draw- 
ing-room. One  side  of  this  room,  therefore,  immediately  overlooks  a  formal  garden,  which  is 
botinded  on  another  side  by  the  walls  of  the  main  building.  'It  opens  on  to  a  spacious  porch 
with  a  semicircular  end,  which 
is  directly  above  the  rocks  at 
the  water's  edge.  This  porch 
also  connects  with  the  pergola 
that  unites  Mr.  Benedict's  house 
with  that  of  Mr.  Hastings, 
bringing  the  two  residences  into 
immediate  contact.  This  plan 
is  obviously  one  determined  by 
the  site;  it  gives  a  drawing- 
room  with  three  open  sides,  the 
windows  of  two  of  which  look 
out  upon  the  water,  while  those 
of  the  third  give  a  view  on  to  the 
pergola  and  the  main  entrance. 

The  water  views  are,  of 
course,  the  very  views  for  which 
the  house  was  built,  and  the 
more    important    rooms    must

present  as  many  of  them  as  possible.  Hence  the  dining-room  is  placed  at  the  extremity  of 
the  main  building,  and  has  three  open  sides,  all  giving  upon  the  water.  It  is  enclosed  on 
the  end  with  a  great  porch  with  a  curved  center.  This  porch  is  so  close  to  the  edge  of  the 
rock  as  to  almost  overhang  it,  and  thus,  with  its  adjoining  room,  has  a  position  of  quite 
unusual  beauty. 

On  the  main  front — the  land  front — the  house  is  entered  through  a  spacious  vestibule 
which  immediately  adjoins  the  porte-cochere.  This  in  turn  opens  into  a  great  hall,  reaching 
wholly  across  the  front  from  end  to  end.  On  the  right  is  a  doorway  to  the  drawing-room;  in 
the  center  is  a  corridor  leading  to  the  dining-room.  On  the  right  of  this  corridor  are  the  library 
and  the  den;  on  the  left,  pantries  and  service-rooms,  with  the  kitchen  beyond.  The  arrange- 
ment of  the  rooms  is  entirely  logical  and  quite  compact,  notwithstanding  the  considerable  floor 
area  over  which  they  are  dis- 
posed. 

Apart  from  the  interest 
which  attaches  to  this  house 
as  a  very  stately,  gracious  and 
refined  piece  of  architecture,  is 
the  still  greater  interest  that 
arises  from  its  surroundings. 
The  estate  is  a  unit.  The  archi- 
tects who  planned  and  designed 
the  house  also  planned  and 
designed  the  grounds.  A  single 
mind  permeates  the  whole, 
house,  gardens,  subsidiary  build- 
ings, walks,  fountains,  decora- 
tions. It  is  an  interesting  study 
in  house  designing,  with  the 
grounds  and  surroundings  in 
perfect  harmony  with  the  dwell- 
ing. It  would  seem  that,  so  far 
as  is  possible,  this  house  and 
garden  is  a  work  of  art.  Nature 
is  here  called  upon  to  do  her 
loveliest,  and  in  the  fine  natural 
scenery  of  the  locality  that  did 
not  seem  a  difficult  task.  The 
architects  were  called  upon  to

the  result  shows  how  far  they  succeeded.     Apparently  there  was  no  limitation  in  any  direction ; 
and  yet  the  house  is  not  too  costly,  the  grounds  not  too  elaborate.  > 

The  other  buildings  of  the  estate,  in  addition  to  the  architectural  features  of  the  garden, 
include  a  boat  house  and  stable.  The  former  is,  of  course,  necessitated  by  the  location  of  the 
property  and  the  very  ample  boating  and  sailing  facilities,  which  are  among  its  chief  attrac- 
tions. The  stable  is  an  extensive  group  of  buildings,  designed  in  the  same  style  as  the  house, 
but  somewhat  more  modern  in  feeling,  an  ornamental  structure  of  much  quiet  dignity.  It  is 
grouped  around  a  stable  yard,  which  it  encloses  on  three  sides,  and  is  placed  considerably  to 
the  left  of  the  entrance  driveway.  It  need  hardly  be  added  that  it  is  very  complete  in  its 
appointments.  Nor  should  the  gate  lodge  be  forgotten,  a  charming  little  house  of  stone, 
which,  although  modest  in  style,  stifficiently  proclaims  the  importance  of  the  estate  to  which 
it  is  guardian.

A    Group    of   Newport    Palaces 


COMMUNITY  of  wealth  and  pleasure,  Ncw]:)ort  is  the  chief  city  in  the  United  States 
in  which  these  characteristics  are  thoroughly  dominant.  The  social  aspects  of  this 
summer  capital — for  its  in-gatherings  of  pleasure-loving  people  are  truly  national — 
are  known  of  all  men ;  Init  the  highly  important  fact  that  this  great  social  activity 
needs  and  necessitates  an  architectural  background,  a  habitat,  a  scene  and  setting  commen- 
surate with  its  splendid  pleasures,  is  less  generally  recognized,  or  certainly  very  much  less

heard  of.  Yet  the  houses  of  Newport  are  most  important  to  the  gay  doings  of  this  beautiful 
city ;  for  the  life  of  Newport  is  concerned  solely  with  pleasure  and  with  entertainment,  and  fine 
houses,  richly  furnished  and  decorated,  spacious  and  elegant,  built  and  adorned  with  a  delight- 
ful disregard  of  cost  and  expense,  with  beautiful  grounds  arranged  in  a  sumptuous  fashion 
— these  are  the  requirements,  and  the  legitimate  requirements,  of  Newport  palaces.

Splendid  ijiiilding,  therefore,  is  a  fundamental  princiijle  of  Newport  building.  And  so 
great  have  been  its  architectural  activities  of  late  years  that  a  friendly  rivalry  has  sprung  up 
among  the  owners  of  its  large  houses  as  to  who  shall  have  the  most  magnificent  home.  Each 
new  house  is  grander  and  finer  than  its  predecessors.  The  resoiu'ces  of  our  most  resourceful 
architects  are  taxed  to  their  utmost;  the  skill  and  ingenuity  of  our  decorators  and  furnishers 
are  all  but  exhausted  that  the  spacious  mansion  be  fitly  decorated  and  amply  furnished;  the 
taste  of  our  best  landscape  architects  is  brought  into  play  that  the  grovmds  and  gardens  be  in

keeping  with  the  lavish  scale  in  which  each  great  house  is  maintained.  If  the  social  life  is 
maintained  at  a  high  key,  the  architectural  life,  so  to  speak,  is  raised  to  a  corresponding  degree. 
The  architectural  thought  which  lay  behind  the  creation  of  Versailles  is  identical  with 
the  ideas  that  have  brought  the  great  houses  of  Newport  into  existence.  It  is  true  that  Ver- 
sailles was  a  single  palace,  built  by  a  despotic  monarch  for  his  own  delight,  while  Newport  is 
an  aggregation  of  palaces,  built  not  by  despots,  but  by  free  American  citizens.  But  the  palace 
of  Versailles  was  a  vast  architectural  background  for  court  fetes  and  festivities  of  all  sorts. 
Just  so  the  palaces  of  Newport  are  architectural  backgrounds  for  the  pleasures  and  sports  of

its  inhabitants.     The  scale  is  different,  the  place  and  the  manners,  but  the  architectural  mean- 
ing of  both  is  identical. 

The  Newport  house  must  be  large,  splendid,  and  expensive.  It  will  be  the  scene  of 
many  costly  entertainments,  and  it  must,  therefore,  properly  set  forth  the  wealth  and  social 
position  of  its  owner.  It  must  be  suitai^ly  environed  in  handsome  grounds;  it  must  l)e  rich 
within  and  without;  it  must  have  large  rooms  for  entertaining,  and  be  fvxrnished  and 
decorated  in  keeping  with  the  means  of  its  owner;  it  must  possess  architectural  interest,  and 
must  excite  the  admiration  of  every  one  fortunate  enough  to  behold  it  or  privileged  to  enter  its 
well-guarded  portals.  And  all  of  this  is  natural  and  entirely  in  keeping  with  the  ideas  around 
which  Newport  has  been  developed  as  a  favorite  watering  place.  The  great  houses  are  not 
luxuries,  from  the  standpoint  of  their  owners,  but  necessities.  They  are  not  large  for  the 
simple  purpose  of  impressing  the  wayfarer,  but  because  great  spaces  are  needed  within  them. 
They  are  not  splendid  for  the  sheer  display  of  wealth,  but  because  splendid  houses  are  quite 
rightly  regarded  as  the  one  kind  of  house  perfectly  suited  to  their  wealthy  inmates.  They  are 
not  gorgeously  furnished  that  the  money  value  of  the  many  costly  objects  within  them  may 
be  the  object  of  friendly  boasting  among  their  owners,  but  because  these  rich  and  beautiful 
things  are  precisely  the  things  their  owners  wish  to  live  among.  Newport,  at  all  events,  illus- 
trates splendid  living  in  the  most  splendid  fashion  it  has  yet  attained  in  America,  so  far  as 
a  group  of  houses  and  a  group  of  people  are  concerned.  It  is  only  from  this  point  of  view  that 
its  houses  can  be  appreciated. 


'<The    Breakers,"    the    House    of  Mrs.    Cornelius    Vanderbilt. 

Mrs."  Cornelius  Vanderbilt's  mansion,  "The  Breakers,"  at  the  time  at  which  it  was  built, 
and  that  but  a  few  years  since,  established  a  new  standard  in  Newport  building.  Designed  in 
the  Italian  style,  its  three  main  fronts  are  thoroughly  well  studied  and  quite  monumental. 
Each  has  strong  individuality — one  a  two-story  arcade  connecting  the  projecting  wings  over- 
looking the  garden;  another  a  massive  square  porte-cochere  applied  directly  to  the  main  wall; 
the  third  with  a  hemicycle,  again  in  two  stories,  enclosed  with  a  flat  roofed  porch  below,  with 
loggias  on  either  side — ^but  each  obviously  belongs  to  the  same  building,  each  is  so  admirable 
in  itself  as  to  seem  but  a  finer  expression  of  the  gracious  style  which  has  been  so  well 
employed  in  this  fine  design. 

The  stately  and  somewhat  sober  exterior  of  "The  Breakers"  hardly  prepares  one  for 
the  magnificent  interior,  which  is  truly  gorgeous  and  most  sumptuous  in  its  dimensions  and 
adornment.  The  great  hall,  which  rises  to  the  full  height  of  two  stories,  sets  the  keynote 
of  the  whole  dwelling.  It  is  finished  throughout  in  white  marble  and  onyx.  It  is  .square  in 
plan,  with  large  pilasters  dividing  each  wall  into  three  great  bays,  which  contain  rounded  arches 
and  doorways  below,  with  rectangular  openings,  divided  by  central  columns  and  piers,  above, 
and  with  handsome  bronze  railings  which  take  an  important  place  in  the  color  scheme  of  the 


[67]

whole.  The  stau-way  rises  immediately  under  the  central  archway,  projecting  somewhat  into 
the  main  hall,  with  s]ilendid  light  standards  on  either  side.  The  arch  supporting  the  stairs 
rises  in  graceful  curves  to  the  second  story  in  the  stair  hall,  with  overhanging  decorated  vaults 
for  the  gallery  above  it,  while  the  upper  walls  are  marked  off  with  columns  and  pilasters  or 
covered  with  tapestries.  The  architectural  features  of  the  main  hall  are  extraordinarily  rich, 
the  channeling  of  the  pilasters  being  filled  in  with  ornament  below;  there  are  cartouches  and 
festoons  and  panels  of  onyx  above  the  arches,  and  a  festooned  frieze  at  the  base  of  the  elabo- 
rately molded  cornice  which  encloses  a  painting  in  the  center  of  the  ceiling. 

Splendid  as  the  hall  is,  it  is  far  surpassed  by  the  dining-room  in  gorgeousness.  Again 
there  are  white  marble  and  onyx,  but  the  prevailing  tone  of  the  room  is  gold.  The  coved  ceil- 
ing, which  is  richly  painted  and  decorated,  is  upheld  by  columns  standing  before  plain  pilasters, 
between  which  are  arched  panels  and  doorways,  elaborately  framed  and  heavily  carved.  The 
room  is  lighted  by  side  windows  and  by  oval  windows  in  the  ceiling  arches.  The  latter  is  com- 
pleted with  a  painting.  Two  great  crystal  chandehers  depend  from  the  ceiling,  and  crystal 
side  Hghts  are  attached  to  the  columns. 

The  drawing-room  is  in  the  Louis  XV.  style.  The  pilasters  are  decorated  throughout 
with  arabesques,  the  corners  and  the  mantel  being  emphasized  with  free  columns  standing  on 
paneled  bases.  The  walls  are  paneled  and  decorated,  with  additional  enrichments  over  the 
doorways  and  other  openings.  The  colors  are  drab  and  gold;  the  richly  coffered  ceiling  has 
a  central  painting.  The  library  is  finished  in  oak.  It  is  a  quiet  and  dignified  apartment,  with 
built-in  bookcases  surmounted  with  elliptical  arches,  above  which  are  rectangular  panels  and 
a  coffered  ceiHng.  The  mantel  of  carved  stone,  with  a  richly  decorated  overmantel,  was  brought 
from  Italy.  The  billiard-room  is  another  notable  apartment,  with  a  deeply  coved  ceiling, 
with  a  painted  center,  from  which  a  great  crown-like  chandelier  of  bronze  is  hung  by  heavy- 
chains.  The  walls  are  simply  treated,  but  have  arches  below  the  curved  segments  of  the  ceil- 
ing. Special  mention  should  be  made  of  the  loggias  and  porches,  which  are  treated  as  out- 
door rooms.  Their  ceilings  are  vaulted,  either  in  whole  or  in  part,  and  are  quite  splendid  in 
their  decorative  embellishments. 


"Ochre    Court,"    the    House   of  Mrs.    Ogden    Goelet. 

"Ochre  Court,"  like  "The  Breakers,"  was  a  late  work  of  the  same  architect,  the  late 
Richard  M.  Hunt.  No  two  buildings  could,  however,  be  more  different  in  style.  The  archi- 
tectural motifs  of  "Ochre  Court"  are  derived  from  the  simple  models  of  the  French  chateau 
epoch,  when  the  Gothic  feeling  had  not  wholly  disappeared  nor  the  later  Renaissance  taken  on 
the  full  splendor  of  its  subsequent  enrichment.  It  is  three  stor^'es  in  height,  the  uppermost 
story  being  formed  by  the  sloping  roof,  whose  dormer  windows,  partly  plain  and  partly  orna- 
mental, form  a  leading  feature  in  the  architectural  enrichment  of  the  exterior.  A  small  stone 
porch  is  prefixed  to  the  main  entrance,  above  which  is  a  large  muUioned  window,  and  above

that  again  the  highest  roof  of  all,  emphasized  with  the  richest  dormer  of  the  series.  The  garden 
front  has  a  loggia  of  five  delicate  arches  connecting  the  two  wings,  and  is  surrounded  with 
a  balustraded  and  stepped  approach,  which  is  continued  on  the  two  adjoining  sides  of  the  house. 

The  stately  hall  is  almost  without  parallel  among  the  palatial  rooms  of  great  American 
palaces.  It  is  monumental  in  size,  and  designed  and  decorated  in  a  monumental  manner.  It 
consists  of  two  parts:  an  outer  hall,  which  is  entered  directly  from  the  main  doorway,  and 
which  contains,  on  one  side,  the  stairway,  built  of  stone  and  carried  on  arches;  and  an  inner 
or  main  hall,  which  is  purely  decorative  in  purpose.  It  is  three  stories  in  height,  built  of  Caen 
stone,  plain  below,  with  paneled  arches  and  pilasters,  very  refined  in  design  and  beautifully 
chiseled.  The  second  story  is  a  superb  arcade,  decorated  in  every  part,  having  round  arches 
carried  on  piers,  all  minutely  carved  and  paneled,  with  delicate  slender  outer  columns  and 
a  band  of  rich  panels  above.  These  arches  open  on  to  a  gallery  which  runs  entirely  around 
the  hall.  The  third  story  is  also  open,  with  low  round  arches;  those  on  the  sides  opening  into 
the  cove  which  supports  the  gently  curved  ceiling,  while  those  at  the  end  are  cut  into  the  wall. 
There  is  rich  sculpture  here,  with  groups  and  single  figures  in  the  end  spandrels,  and  single 
figures  upholding  the  uppermost  cornice  on  the  sides.  A  large  painting  fills  the  entire  center 
of  the  vault,  save  where  it  is  paneled  at  each  end. 

The  sumptuous  note  that  is  struck  by  this  magnificent  hall  dominates  the  whole  house. 
The  dining-room  is  a  rich  apartment,  with  pilasters  and  paneled  walls,  having  paintings  let  into 
the  architectural  framework,  and  a  painted  ceiling.  The  lireplace  is  double,  with  an  elab- 
orately carved  shelf,  above  which  is  an  oval  mirror.  The  library,  which  overlooks  the  cliff, 
has  been  finished  in  the  Louis  XVI.  style  in  oak  and  gold.  The  walls  are  entirely  paneled, 
with  a  decorated  cornice  that  supports  a  plain  ceiling.  The  rooms  are  spacious  in  size,  and 
richly  furnished  in  keeping  with  the  especial  styles  in  which  they  are  designed. 

"The    Elms,"   the    House   of  E.  J.   Berwind,   Esq. 

"The  Elms,"  the  house  of  E.  J.  Berwind,  Esq.,  is  a  very  recent  addition  to  the  great 
houses  of  Newport,  and  is  much  later  in  date  than  any  of  those  already  described.  It 
is  stately  in  design,  and  is  in  the  sumptuous  Renaissance  style  which  has  become  a  favorite 
vogue  in  residences  of  this  class.  The  house  is  of  generous  size,  broadly  treated;  the  horizontal 
lines  are  well  marked,  and  the  windows  large.  The  central  part,  projected  just  sufficiently  to 
mark  the  entrance  and  to  emphasize  it,  is  well  conceived  and  well  carried  out.  The  rising 
ground  on  which  it  is  placed  adds  materially  to  its  dignity. 

That  the  interior  is  ornate  the  exterior  has  already  told  us.  No  one  builds  a  house 
of  this  design  in  such  a  place  without  preparing  for  greater  sumptuousness  within  than 
may  be  discerned  without.  One  naturally  lavishes  decorations  on  an  interior  that  one  refrains 
from  exposing  to  the  vulgar  eye  outside.  The  inside  of  the  house  is,  therefore,  very  much 
more  splendid  than  the  splendid  outside.     Broad  corridors,  lofty  ceilings,  large  rooms,  gilding,

precious  marbles,  superb  tapestries,  rich  furniture,  fine  paintings,  costly  carpets — these  form 
the  contents  of  every  great  house,  the  individuality  depending  upon  the  taste  of  the  owner 
and  the  architect,  and  the  particular  kind  of  rich  possessions  available.  All  these  adjuncts 
to  splendid  living  are  well  used  in  Mr.  Berwind's  house,  which  is  richly  furnished  and  decorated 
and  contains  many  notable  works  of  art. 

The  chief  rooms  are  the  ballroom,  the  dining-room,  the  library,  the  palm-room,  the  draw- 
ing-room, the  breakfast-room,  the  gallery  hall,  and  the  stair  hall.  The  stairs  ascend  on  either 
side  of  the  entrance  and  rise  directly  from  the  main  hall,  which  in  itself  is  a  spacious  apart- 
ment, richly  decorated  and  furnished.  The  ballroom  is  a  very  beautiful  apartment,  paneled 
throughout,  and  with  paintings  let  into  the  panels  above  the  great  double  doors.  The  dining- 
room  is  one  of  the  finest  rooms  in  the  house,  with  a  coffered  ceiling,  monumental  mantel- 
piece, decorative  panels,  and  fine  paintings.  It  is  truly  a  "state"  dining-room,  ample  in  size, 
and  admirably  adapted  to  the  giving  of  large  dinners  and  elaborate  entertainments. 

The  best  use  has  been  made  of  the  surrounding  grounds  by  a  formal  treatment  with 
terraces  and  stairways,  vases,  statues,  and. shrubbery  balustrades,  and  a  free  use  of  shrubbery 
and  plants.  The  garden  is  not  large,  for  the  comparative  smallness  of  the  Newport  gardens 
has  been  frequently  criticized;  but  it  has  been  very  beautifully  treated,  and  forms  a  very 
happy  setting  for  the  mansion  for  which  it  has  been  created.

Belcourt,"   the   House   of  O.    H.   P.   Belmont,   Esq. 


"Belcourt,"  the  house  of  O.  H.  P.  Belmont,  Esq.,  was  also  designed  by  Mr.  Hunt,  but 
is  much  earlier  in  date  than  "The  Breakers"  or  "Ochre  Court."  Built  when  its  owner  was 
a  bachelor,  it  has  been  somewhat  flippantly  described  as  the  home  of  a  bachelor  with  a  taste 
for  hospitality  and  for  horses,  or,  in  other  words,  "a  palatial  stable  with  an  incidental  apart- 
ment and  an  incidental  ballroom."  It  is  immaterial  whether  this  be  literally  true  or  not;  it 
certainly  is  no  longer  true,  for  a  verv  gracious  lady  now  presides  over  it.  It  is  more  to  the  point 
that  its  plan  and  arrangement  called  for  unusual  treatment,  and  that  these  unusual  require- 
ments have  been  met  in  a  thoroughly  happy  and  delightful  way.  The  house  is  two  stories 
in  height,  with  a  third  story  in  a  mansard  roof,  lighted,  save  in  the  corner  pavilions,  which 
have  larger  windows,  with  oval  dormers  with  curved  hoods.  It  is  built  of  stone  and  brick, 
rough  cast,  the  central  wall  paneled  below,  with  rectangular  windows  below  the  large  round 
arched  windows,  which  form  a  glazed  arcade  completely  filling  the  center  of  the  front.  The 
interior  court  has  much  greater  picturesque  interest,  being  finished  in  rough  cast  and  open 
timber  work,  with  an  open  loggia  above,  which,  notwithstanding  its  lightness  of  construc- 
tion, is  the  dominant  feature,  and  whose  drai)ed  cvu^tains  or  awnings  give  it  quite  a  Southei"n  air. 

The  hall  is  finished  in  oak,  modest  below,  and  with  a  staircase  under  a  carved  arch  that 
leads  to  the  upper  hall,  which  is  much  more  elaborately  treated  with  carved  doorways,  a  coved

been    mounted    on  manikins  and    placed  upon  horses,  which    have    been  draped    and  fully 
caparisoned,  showing  how  the  knights  would  appear  when  arrayed  for  a  tourney. 

The  loft  above  is  provided  with  a  large  and  sweetly  toned  organ,  while  the 
windows  are  filled  with  colored  glass  representing  battle  scenes  and  tournaments.  Richly 
embroidered  flags  hang  from  the  ceiling,  from  which  also  depend  large  chandeliers.  A  screen 
covered  with  historic  bits,  spurs,  and  other  medieval  trappings  forms  an  important  part  of 
the  collection.  The  beautiful  dining-room  is  oval,  treated  in  green  and  white,  and  designed 
in  the  Empire  style.  The  walls  are  marked  off  with  columns,  between  which  hang  heavy  cur- 
tains. The  room  is  lined  with  mirrors,  the  openings  of  the  bay  window  being  closed  at  night

distinct  character  among  the  Renaissance  palaces  which  abound  in  Newport.  It  is 
a  genuinely  castellated  building,  quite  unusual  in  style,  and,  quite  unusual  for  Newport, 
placed  on  an  estate  of  about  one  hundred  and  twenty-five  acres.     The    house    stands    alone,

with  no  near-by  edifice  with  which  it  may  come  in  immediate  contrast.  It  is  built  of  stone 
taken  from  the  land  on  which  it  stands,  a  pudding-stone  having  the  quality  of  a  natural 
concrete.  Much  of  it  is  covered  with  natural  moss,  and  hardly  an  individual  stone  shows; 
but  there  is  a  superb  massiveness  in  the  walls,  which  are  dark  gray,  with  a  genuinely  antique 
character. 

The  house  is  entered  under  the  great  massive  tower.  A  vaulted  corridor  or  entrance 
hall  leads  to  the  great  central  hall,  a  superb  apartment,  two  stories  in  height.  It  is  not  only 
the  central  room  of  the  house,  but  the  most  important.  To  the  left  is  a  platform,  with  a  fine 
])ipe  organ,  flanked  on  cither  side  l^y  a  cathedral-like  window;  below  them  are  Sjmnish  church 
stalls,  with  high,  heavih-  carved  backs,  having  opal  panels  with  heads  in  the  center;  fine  black 
oak  stalls  of  unusual  beauty,  admirably  placed.  On  the  opposite  side  is  a  row  of  columns 
and  pointed  arches,  a  certain  irregularity  being  given  to  the  space  by  cutting  off  a  part  with 
curtains.  The  walls  are  of  rough  gray  plaster  with  sand  finish,  and,  save  the  carved  capitals 
of  the  columns,  there  are  no  moldings  or  decorations  beloved  of  the  architects.  The  coffered 
ceiling  is  of  California  redwood,  with  beams  supported  by  old  Florentine  shields ;  in  the  center 
is  a  large  skylight,  with  a  brilliant  sunburst  in  the  middle.  At  night  this  is  lighted  above.  The 
walls  are  hung  with  superb  old  tapestries  and  rare  paintings.  The  parquet  floor  is  covered 
with  rich  rugs.     The  furniture  is  old  and  chieflv  Italian.

The  general  shape  of  the  building  is  rectangular,  with  the  entrance  at  one  end.  A  small 
corridor  to  the  left  of  the  entrance  leads  to  Mr.  Clark's  den;  an  elevator,  also  recessed,  is  just 
before  his  door.     Immediately  opposite,  on  the  right,  is  a  staircase  to  the  second  floor. 

Passing  into  the  hall,  one  is  at  once  attracted  by  the  great  window  at  the  end  of  a  cor- 
ridor exactly  opposite  the  entrance  hall.  To  its  left  is  the  dining-room,  to  the  right  the  draw- 
ing-room, the  two  rooms  and  the  separating  corridor  being  so  arranged  that,  from  the  dinner 
table,  one  may  look  out  through  the  drawing-room  windows  upon  the  view  beyond. 

The  dining-room  is  three  steps  above  the  level  of  the  entrance  corridor.  Like  all  the 
interior,  except  the  drawing-room,  it  has  sand-finished  walls.  The  furniture  is  gilt  and  red, 
and  o\'er  the  \'ast  marble  sideboard  is  a  mirror  which  reflects  the  view  from  the  great  bay 
window  opposite.  The  drawing-room  has  an  elliptical  vault,  illuminated  at  night. with  lights 
placed  in  stars,  abotit  a  hundred,  a  brilliant  efTect  that  needs  to  be  seen  to  be  appreciated. 
The  walls  are  hung  with  cloth-of-gold  material,  against  which  are  placed  mirrors  and  pictures. 
The  furniture  is  gilt  and  of  Italian  origin. 

The  second  floor  has  a  series  of  corridors  and  loggias  surrounding  the  central  hall.  Here 
are  guest  rooms  and  the  rooms  of  the  owner.  In  the  far  corner,  adjoining  the  owner's  bedroom, 
is  a  morning  room,  decorated  in  Chinese  materials  and  with  Oriental  effect.  The  corner 
windows  afford  a  superb  view. 


The    House   of  Mrs.   Richard    Gambrill. 

The  startling  beauty  and  daring  originality  of  Mrs.  Richard  Gambrill 's  house  give  it 
high  rank  among  the  notable  houses  of  America.  It  is  one  of  the  most  individual  mansions 
in  Newport :  a  house  of  refined  beauty,  admirably  studied  in  all  its  parts,  yet  of  truly  spontaneous 
design.  It  is  a  large,  rectangular  building,  with  a  high-pitched  roof,  which  contains  two  stories 
of  dormer  windows,  the  upper  series  being  small  ovals.  The  high  plain  chimneys  are  a  very 
marked  feature  of  the  roof.  The  walls  are  without  vertical  lines,  and  have  no  architectural 
treatment,  save  a  shallow  string  course  at  the  base  of  the  windows  in  the  second  story.  The 
windows  have  no  external  frames,  but  are  sunk  in  the  thick  wall :  each  has  a  carved  keystone, 
which,  in  those  of  the  first  story,  is  assimilated  with  a  carved  decoration  under  the  shallow 
balconies  below  the  upper  windows.  These  balconies  are  supported  by  carved  brackets,  and 
the  base  of  the  windows  is  enclosed  within  wrought  iron  railings.  A  somewhat  narrow  cornice, 
with  quite  marked  projection,  crowns  the  wall  and  serves  as  a  base  for  the  roof.  Such,  very 
briefly  summarized,  are  the  chief  elements  of  the  design  of  the  main  part  of  the  house. 

The  ornamental  features  of  the  exterior  are,  however,  very  marked.  The  fine  proportions, 
the  admirable  spacing  of  the  voids  and  solids,  the  treatment  of  the  carved  ornament — very 
slight,  indeed,  but  very  admirably  used — sen'c  at  once  to  give  this  design  distinction.  But 
the  doorways  and  loggias  are   so  highly   ornamental,  and  the  latter  so  original,  as  to  give

a  sjiecial  character  to  this  most  interesting  house.  The  doorways  are  quite  monumental  in 
design — round  arched  portals  with  double  columns,  sui)i)orting  an  entablature  which  carries 
a  l)alustrade,  forming  the  central  balcony.  The  detail  here  is  very  l)eautiful  and  in  l)rillianl 
contrast  with  the  sobriety  with  which  the  adjoining  walls  are  finished.  The  loggias  are  the 
chief  distinction  of  the  house  and  its  most  conspicuous  ornament.  They  stand  one  at  each 
end  of  the  garden  front.  The\'  are  identical  in  design,  one  story  high,  with  three  arches  on  the 
side  and  a  projecting  ba}-  on  the  front.  The  arches  are  plainly  cut,  without  moldings,  l)ut 
have  large  car\'ed  keystones  and  festooned  spandrels.  The  walls  are  trellised  in  formal  ])atterns 
with  large  ui)])cr  ovals,   and  the  windows  have  elal)orately  designed  fanlights  in   the  arches

o\-er  the  oiieiiings.  The  balustrade  which  crowns  the  cornice  has  sculptured  groups  of  children 
on  the  corner  piers. 

The  grounds  which  surround  the  house  have  been  arranged  in  line  harmonx-  with  it. 
The  building  stands  on  a  terrace,  much  of  which  is  enclosed  within  balustrades.  The  a])proaches 
of  the  two  fronts  are  much  alike,  with  broad  flights  of  steps,  balustrades  finished  at  the  ends 
with  large  vases,  and  very  symmetrical  bay  trees.  On  the  right  of  the  entrance  front  is  the 
stable,  and  a  service  yard  which  is  placed  at  a  lower  level  than  the  spacious  fore  court  and  other 
grounds.  On  the  other  side  of  the  house  is  a  great  green  garden,  with  paths  of  grass  marked 
ofT  with  low  borders  of  flowers,  and  a  vast  central  fountain,  whose  jet  throws  a  stream  of  water 
high  into  the  air.  Stone  benches  are  placed  around  the  fountain,  and  groups  of  statuary  stand 
on  decorated  bases.  On  the  sides  of  the  house  the  view  is  closed  with  a  latticed  pergola,  with 
piers  of  small  o]3en  circles  and  latticed  panels.  Sculptured  figures  stand  under  the  openings, 
and  at  one  end  is  a  great  domed  summer  house,  also  of  lattice  design. 

With  such  a  splendid  exterior,  a  sumptuous  interior  follows  as  a  matter  of  course.  The 
entrance  hall  is  designed  in  a  monumental  manner,  with  walls  of  Caen  stone  and  columns  of 
polished  marble.  The  door  openings  are  flat,  with  round  arched  niches  between  them,  and 
the  cornice  is  richl}-  detailed.  To  the  right,  the  stairs  to  the  upper  story  ascend  in  a  graceful 
curve;   behind  them  are  the  i^antries  and  service-rooms  which  connect  with  other  rooms  and

with  the  kitchen  in  the  basement.  To  the  right  is  the  Hbrary,  a  daintily  designed  room  in 
very  light  green.  Three  large  rooms  on  the  garden  front  complete  the  apartments  on  this 
floor.  In  the  center  is  the  salon,  exquisitely  paneled  with  ornament  in  low  relief.  The  living- 
room  on  the  left  is  paneled  throughout  with  Italian  walnut,  with  ornaments  in  subdued  gold. 
The  dining-room,  on  the  right,  is  paneled  with  pilasters. 

The  loggias  form  open  rooms  for  the  summer,  but  are  enclosed  for  the  cold  weather. 
Their  lower  walls  are  lined  with  stone;  above  is  a  frieze,  painted  by  James  Wall  Finn,  of  vases  of 
flowers  and  birds  under  trellised  arbors.  A  similar  design,  with  many  variations,  is  painted  on 
the  ceilings.  A  light  bluish  green  is  the  dominant  color  in  these  very  remarkable  and 
highly  individual  decorations. 

"Hopedene,"   the   House   of   Mrs.  E.   H.  G.  Slater. 

"Hopedene,"  the  house  of  Mrs.  E.  H.  G.  Slater,  is  designed  in  a  quiet  Itahan  style, 
very  subdued  in  treatment,  but  thoroughly  good  and  homelike  in  character.  The  entrance  is 
on  the  side,  with  a  round  roofed  porch.  The  windows  of  the  first  story  have  round  arches; 
those  of  the  second  are  flat-topped,  all  quite  simply  cut  in  white  stone  and  directly  ap]:)lied  to 
the  brick  of  which  the  wahs  are  built.  The  garden  front  has  two  symmetrical  wings,  with 
a  broad  terrace  between  them,  enclosed  within  a  balustrade  and  covered  with  a  wide  awning_ 
In  the  center  of  the  second  story  is  a  triple  window  under  a  great  round  arch,  which  lights 
the  stairs  in  the  hall.  A  semicircular  porch  in  two  stories  is  the  central  feature  of  the  opposite 
side,  which  is  supported  by  a  terrace,  with  balustrades  and  steps.  A  very  low  sloping  roof, 
with  low  dormers  and  broadly  projecting  eaves,  covers  the  building.

AMERICAN     ESTATES     AND     GARDENS 

A  large  hall  fills  the  center  of  the  house.  It  is  designed  in  the  style  of  the  Italian 
Renaissance.  The  richly  decorated  ceiling  is  suppoi'ted  by  Ionic  columns.  The  walls  are  paneled 
and  decorated  with  ornamental  niches.  The  stairway  fills  one  side,  with  a  platform  below 
the  triple  window.  The  furniture  coverings  and  curtains  are  of  green  velvet.  The  reception- 
room  and  library  are  on  one  side;  the  dining-room,  with  pantries  and  kitchen  beyond,  on  the 
other.  The  reception-room  is  paneled  in  oak,  with  paintings  let  into  the  large  panels.  The 
smaller  panels  are  delicately  ornamented,  and  the  mirror  frame  is  very  elaborately  treated. 
A  cornice  in  relief  completes  the  wall  decoration.  The  dining-room  is  more  formal  in  style, 
the  cornice  upheld  by  Corinthian  pilasters,  and  the  walls  paneled  and  with  built-in  mirrors. 
The  doorways  are  surmounted  with  semicircular  arches  with  decorated  panels.  The  library  is 
a  room  of  quite  unusual  beauty,  and  is  a  close  copy  of  the  celebrated  library  in  the  Chateau  de 
Blois.  Like  its  famous  prototype,  the  walls  are  completely  covered  with  small  decorated 
panels,  and  the  fieur-de-lis  forms  the  motif  of  the  ornamentation  of  the  overmantel. 

The  house  stands  on  a  little  peninsula,  so  that  two  adjoining  sides  directly  face  the  ocean, 
and,  indeed,  open  directly  upon  it.  The  grounds  are  laid  out  as  a  formal  garden,  and  are  decorated 
with  many  notable  pieces  of  sculpture  and  handsomely  carved  marbles. 


"Rosecliff,"   the    House   of  Mrs.   Hermann    Oelrichs. 

The  design  of  "Rosecliflf,"  Mrs.  Hermann  Oelrichs's  house,  is  based  on  that  of  the  Grand 
Trianon  at  Versailles.  It  is  in  no  sense  a  reproduction  of  that  famous  palace,  for  no  attempt  has 
been  made  to  reproduce  its  vast  scale,  and  the  second  story,  which  is  treated  as  an  architectural 
attic,  does  not  appear  in  the  prototype,  but  was  quite  obviously  necessitated  by  American 
conditions,  which,  in  a  residential  mansion,  required  a  structure  of  more  than  one  story  in  height, 
as  is  the  case  with  the  French  palace.  The  Grand  Trianon  is  a  somewhat  cold  building  of  not 
very  great  architectural  interest.  Quite  the  contrary  can  be  said  of  Mrs.  Oelrichs's  house, 
for  it  is  smaller,  more  compact,  and  more  ornate;  and,  being  an  American  residence  containing 
a  large  suite  of  splendid  rooms,  it  is  apparent  that  the  design  is  original,  although,  like  many 
original  designs,  it  is  based  on  a  distinct  historical  idea. 

The  house  is  built  of  white  terra-cotta,  and  its  general  plan  is  after  the  form  of  the  letter 
H,  giving  an  open  court  on  each  side.  The  architectural  treatment  of  the  exterior  is  throughout 
quite  similar,  and  consists  of  round  arched  windows  in  the  first  story,  enclosed  within  pilasters 
supporting  an  entablature,  above  which  is  the  second  story,  with  flat-topped  windows  and  smaller 
pilasters  corresponding  to  those  below.  The  open  court  on  the  seaside  is  filled  with  a  great 
terrace,  enclosed  within  a  marble  balustrade,  with  large  vases  on  the  corners  and  at  the  top  of 
the  steps,  and  decorated  with  bay  trees  and  other  plants.  On  the  lawn  below  are  three 
large  groups  of  sculpture,  the  central  one,  an  impressive  seated  figure  of  a  woman,  forming  the 
chief  feattire  of  a  fountain. 


[103] 


AMERICAN     ESTATES     AND     GARDENS 

The  courts  which  fill  the  centers  of  the  tw.o  sides  are  somewhat  differently  treated,  but 
each  includes  a  terrace  which  projects  well  forward  beyond  the  walls  of  the  house.  The  garden 
front  is  distinctly  the  richer,  as  befits  the  more  retired  and  private  part  of  the  house.  The 
wings  are  longer  here,  with  three  windows  on  the  side,  while  on  the  sea  front  they  have  but 
one.  Across  the  three  central  openings  of  the  center  is  a  colonnade  of  double  columns,  with  an 
entablature  on  which  are  four  sculptured  groups.  The  garden  terrace  has  no  balustrade,  but 
is  laid  out  in  box  borders  and  adorned  with  many  plants  and  bay  trees.  Two  standing  lions 
are  placed  at  the  center  of  the  steps,  and  the  platform  contains  marble  seats,  superb  vases,  and 
a  delightful  fountain  in  the  middle.     Another  fountain  stands  on  the  lawn  below. 

In  a  very  literal  sense  of  the  word  this  magnificent  house  is  a  palace.  It  is  architectural 
elegance  of  a  very  refined  and  penetrating  character.  It  is  sumptuous  architecture,  moreover, 
very  beautifully  composed  and  very  carefully  treated.  It  is  a  house  built  quite  obviously 
for  stately  living,  and  has,  most  naturally,  a  thoroughly  distinguished  air.  The  grounds  have 
been  developed  and  decorated  in  a  sumptuous  manner,  and  add  very  largely  to  the  splendor 
of  the  mansion  which  they  surround.

"White  Hall" 

The    House   of  Henry    M.   Flagler,   Esq.,    Palm    Beach,    Florida. 


IKE  many  great  modern  houses,  the  Flagler  mansion  at  Palm  Beach  is  compara- 
tively simple  in  its  external  treatment.  It  is  eminently  stately  and  serene,  the  great 
colonnade  of  the  main  front  being  the  chief  external  adornment.  The  columns  are 
monumental  in  scale,  and  the  five  great  arched  openings  behind  them,  and  the  large 
windows  above,  are  direct  expressions  of  internal  splendor  of  dimensions  which  the  whole  of 
the  exterior  admirably  denotes. 

Architecturally,  it  is  two  stories  in  height,  the  attic  story  being  in  the  roofs,  which  are 
long  and  low  and  sloping,  and  whose  varying  heights  have  been  cleverly  utilized  in  giving  variety 
to  the  silhouette.  It  is  classic  in  feeHng  and  in  detail,  but  bears  unmistakably  the  character 
of  a  great  American  countr)'  house,  admirably  adapted  to  its  environment  in  the  beautiful 
Florida  landscape  in  which  it  has  been  placed.

•  The  front  is  a  liundred  and  seventy-five  feet  long  and  the  de])th  a  hundred  and  fifty- 
five  feet.  Such  dimensions  would  be  intolerable  in  a  Northern  house;  Ijut  thcv  are  none  too 
great  here,  since  the  center  of  the  dwelling  is  occupied  by  a  court,  about  ninety  feet  by  fift}- 
feet,  spacious  enough  to  amjily  light  all  the  rooms  and  passages  that  oi)en  upon  it,  and 
forming  a  most  entrancing  center  to  this  magnificent  home. 

Directly  before  one,  as  one  enters  the  hall,  is  the  double  staircase  of  white  statuary 
marble  to  the  upper  story.  It  occupies  fully  a  half  of  the  whole  length  of  the  hall,  standing 
in  a  recess  of  its  own,  the  beginning  of  the  stairs  being  marked  off  with  four  columns  of  pohshed 
Anicrican  white  and  green  marble,  with  a  great  marble  vase  before  each  group.  The  hand- 
rails are  beautiful  examples  of  modern  lironze  work;  before  each  ramp  is  a  fine  piece  of  old 
tapestry;  a  central  window  looks  into  the  court.  The  walls  are  of  white  and  green  marble, 
and  at  each  end  is  a  screen  of  double  columns,  standing  one  close  behind  the  other,  forming 
inner  vestibules  to  the  rooms  that  open  from  either  end.  The  ceiling  is  richlv  carved,  and 
treated  in  gray  with  ornamentation  in  solid  gold ;  in  the  center  is  a  large  circular  painting  by 
Benevenotti.     The  chairs,  tables,  and  chests  with  which  the  hall  is  furnished  were  expressly

made  for  this  room,  and  are  fine  examples  of  costly  workmanshi]j.  The  splendid  marble  floor 
is  partly  covered  with  superb  rugs.     The  general  treatment  is  Louis  XVI. 

On  the  right  of  the  hall  is  the  drawing-room,  and  on  the  left  the  library.  The  latter  is 
an  agreeable  room  to  read  in.  Nothing  is  wanting  to  heighten  the  effect.  The  style  is  Renais- 
sance. The  walls  have  a  high  wainscot  of  Circassian  walnut,  with  red  Spanish  damask  of 
two  shades  above.  The  walnut  mantelpiece  between  the  windows  is  paneled  with  brass 
ornaments,  and  is  richly  gilt,  the  overmantel  being  filled  with  a  life-size  portrait  of 
Mr.  Flagler. 

Then  comes  the  art  gallery  and  music-room,  an  apartment  of  large  size,  admirably 
designed  for  the  choice  collection  of  paintings  it  contains.  It  is  treated  in  old  ivory  and  antique 
gold.  In  the  center  of  the  ceiling  is  a  copy  of  Guido  Reni's  "Aurora."  It  is  lighted  with 
jeweled  crystal  chandeliers.     At  one  end  is  a  large  pipe  organ. 

The  next  room  is  the  billiard-room,  a  quaint  apartment  in  the  Swiss  style.  The  beamed 
ceiling  is  distinctly  Teutonic  in  decorative  feeling. 

The  grand  salon  is  on  the  right  of  the  hall,  corresponding  to  the  library.  It  is  Louis 
XVI.  in  style,  and  is  a  sumptuous  apartment  in  French  gray,  the  walls  paneled  in  gold  and 
gray  Ijrocaded  silk.  It  contains  a  beautiful  mantel  of  white  statuary  marble;  the  ceiling  has 
decorated  medallions;  the  portieres  are  richly  embroidered,  and  the  furniture  is  elaborate  and 
costly. 

Immediately  adjoining  it  is  the  dining-room,  most  hospitable  in  size.  The  style  is 
Frangois  I.,  and  the  color  scheme  a  rich  green;  the  walls  have  a  paneled  wainscot  of  satinwood 
below  and  a  rich  brocade  above.  The  elaborate  mantelpiece  supports  a  mirror.  The  beau- 
tiful ceiling  is  coffered  in  large  squares,  with  ornaments  in  high  relief,  and  is  green  and  cream. 
The  furniture  was  expressly  made  for  this  room.  Adjoining  the  dining-room  is  a  small  break- 
fast-room, in  ivory  enamel;  the  ceiling  ornamentation  is  tipped  with  gold;  the  furniture  is 
mahogany  with  bronze  mountings. 

Beyond  is  the  kitchen,  with  pantries,  serving-rooms,  storage-rooms,  and  other  depend- 
encies, filling  an  extension  beyond  the  main  building.  In  a  corresponding  space  on  the  other 
side  are  two  offices,  one  of  which  is  set  apart  for  Mr.  Flagler's  personal  use. 

The  rear  of  the  house — in  the  space  on  the  farther  side  of  the  court  and  corresponding 
to  the  hall— is  filled  with  a  ballroom.  The  style  is  Louis  XV.,  and  the  color  scheme  white  and 
gold.  Five  great  openings  on  either  side  form  the  motif:  on  one  side  they  are  windows;  on 
the  opposite  side  they  are  curtained  doorways.  The  spaces  between  have  round  arched  panels 
filled  with  mirrors.  The  hangings  and  draperies  are  of  Rose  du  Barry  silk.  The  decorations 
are  almost  purely  architectural,  the  doorways,  windows,  and  mirror  panels  being  encased  within 
a  wood  paneling.  The  panels  over  the  doors  and  windows  are  copies  by  Gatty,  of  Paris.  The 
ceiling  is  treated  in  large  rectangles,  the  alternate  ones  being  the  richer.  The  room  is  illuminated 
by  lights  dependent  from  the  ceiling  and  by  side  lights.  The  furniture,  as  befits  a  ballroom, 
is  confined  to  low  stools  and  benches.

The  bedrooms,  which  fill  the  upper  story,  are  fitted  up  with  rare  taste  and  fine  indi- 
viduality of  treatment.  Much  of  their  furniture  has  been  especially  designed  for  the  particular 
rooms  in  which  it  is  placed.  Unlike  a  great  covmtry  house  in  the  North,  this  vast  Southern 
palace  has  no  outbuildings  and  subsidiary  structures.  One  does  not  keep  a  stable  of  horses  at 
Palm  Beach,  and  one  does  not  need  elaborately  planned  and  cultivated  gardens  to  set  off  one's 
house.  Plants  and  flowers,  trees  and  shrubs,  grow  here  unaided  and  with  rare  Southern 
profuseness  and  rapidity.

The   House   of  Henry  W.  Poor,  Esq. 


Tuxedo,   New   York 


^^3||HE  house  of  Mr.  Poor  is  one  of  the  most  notalile  at  Tuxedo.     It  occupies  a  command- 


^"^ '^s    ^"S  position  on  the  summit  of  Tower  Hill,  and  dominates  the  whole  of  Tuxedo  Park. 

^1  It  is  a  beautiful  house  in  the  Jacobean  style,  stately  and  dignified  in  its  ]jarts,  and 

admirably  adapted  to  its  position.     No  tower  or  pyramidal  effect  was  needed  to  give 

emphasis  to  such  a  situation,  but  the  roof  line  is  very  happily  broken  by  the  curved  gable  ends, 

the    tops    of    which    stand    out 

free  against  the  skv. 

It  is  U-shaped  in  ].)lan,  the 
hollow  containing  the  entrance 
front  being  awa}-  from  the  bluff 
on  which  the  hovise  is  Iniilt. 
This  front  has  a  slightly  ex- 
tended center,  with  an  open 
porch  below,  and  two  short 
wings,  which  create  an  open 
court.  The  house  it  built  of 
dark  red  and  black  l)rick,  with 
stone  trimmings.  The  most 
elaborate  feature  of  the  exterior 
is  at  the  main  entrance — a 
richly  carved  frontispiece  of 
stone  that  verv  happilv  empha- 
sizes its  purpose.  The  whole 
design  is  quite  svmmetrical, 
although  the  left  wing  contains 
an  addition  for  the  service 
rooms,  and  a  kitchen  court 
enclosed  within  a  brick  wall. 
These  parts  have,  however, 
been  so  subordinated  as  not 
to  interfere  with  the  general 
harmony  and  symmetry  of  the 
design.

AMERICAN     ESTATES     AND     GARDENS 


The  garden  front  follows  out  the  same  general  idea,  but  the  three  gables  here  are  on 
a  line.  Here  are  three  slight  extensions,  surmounted  with  gables,  each  containing  bay  windows 
in  two  stories.  All  the  windows  are  in  groups  or  pairs,  mullioned  with  stone  frames.  The  side 
porches,  in  two  stories,  are  fine,  built  of  stone,  with  stone  paneled  ]Mers;  richly  coffered  ceilings 
add  to  their  splendor.  The  one  overlooking  the  lake  seems  built  directl}-  on  the  cliff,  and 
commands  a  superb  view. 

The  main  doorway  opens  directly  into  the  hall,  a  gallery-like  apartment  which  runs 
the  full  length  of  the  house.  Immediately  in  face  is  the  drawing-room;  to  the  right  is  a  double- 
arched  entrance  to  the  stairs,  and  then  the  library,  wh'ch  is  entered  from  the  end  of  the  hall. 
To  the  left  is  a  small  reception  room,  with  the  dining-room  beyond  and  a  passageway  to  the 
service  rooms.  All  the  main 
rooms  on  this  floor,  therefore, 
open  directly  on  to  the  hall. 

A  very  charming  hall  it  is 
too.  From  floor  to  ceiling  it  is 
paneled  in  oak,  with  richh" 
carved  door-frames.  The  ceil- 
ing, like  all  the  ceilings  on  this 
floor,  is  plastered  in  geometric 
design.  The  floor  is  of  hard 
wood,  with  a  rich  green  carpet. 
It  is  at  once  a  hall  and  a  gal- 
lery, admirably  proportioned 
and  treated  throughout  in  a 
thoroughly  architectural  and 
dignified  manner.  Manv  hand- 
some pieces  of  furniture  are 
placed  within  it;  high-back 
chairs  handsome  tables,  a  cou- 
ple of  fine  old  chests  before  the 
windows. 

The  drawing-room  walls  are 
covered  with  light  gray  silk  of 
delicate  texture.  A  rare  old 
Italian  door-frame,  elaboratelv 
carved  in  stone,  encloses  the 
doorway.  The  ch'mneypiece  is 
also  treasure -trove  from  Europe, 
and  fills  a  goodly  part  of  one  THE  MANTEL  IN  THE  DINING-ROOM.

side.  Oil  one  wall  is  a  fine  old  ])iece  of  ta])estry  in  a  richly  carved  canopied  frame.  The  room 
is  not  large;  for  this  is  a  summer  home,  built  for  summer  use  only,  and  for  a  life  chiefly  si)ent 
out  of  doors. 

It  is,  therefore,  quite  natural  that  the  library  should  be  a  larger  room.  It  is  lined 
throughout  with  books  to  the  tops  of  the  door-frames.  The  mantel  is  modern,  of  wood, 
decorated  in  panels.  At  one  end  is  a  great  table;  toward  the  other  a  rare  old  desk,  with  large 
carved  figures.  The  dining-room,  like  the  hall,  is  paneled  throughout  in  wood;  it  has  an 
ornamented  stone  mantel  of  ample  size.  Just  beyond  is  the  pantry,  with  a  servants'  dining-room 
in  the  wing;  the  corresponding  wing  on  the  library  side  is  filled  with  a  suite  of  apartments, 
a  sitting-room,  and  bedrooms. 

The  archways  enclosing  the  space  within  which  are  the  stairs  are  richly  carved,  as  are 
also  the  newel  posts  and  handrail.  The  under-steps  lead  down  to  the  Smoke  Room.  The 
floor  is  of  l)rick ;  the  walls  are  of  wood,  unpaneled ;  the  ceiling  is  beanied ;  the  fire])lace  is  encased 
within  a  gigantic  stone  framework  that  saw  much  use  abroad  before  being  finally  set  up  here. 
There  are  many  trophies;  the  walls  are  thickly  covered  with  prints  and  illustrations  of  hunting 
and  horse  life;   a  narrow  shelf  is  crowded  with  jars,  pots,  steins,  candlesticks,  ]:ilates,  and  knick-

knacks  in  delightful  profusion.  There  are  deer  heads  and  other  relics  of  the  chase,  and  strings 
of  hornet  nests — most  suggestive  of  the  strenuous  outdoor  life.  It  is  a  room  of  quiet,  simple 
charm,  a  room  for  a  man  to  be  happy  in,  and  happy  with  his  friends. 

One  has  but  to  step  out  of  the  door  to  find  one's  self  on  one  of  the  terraces.  Tuxedo 
Park  is  itself  one  great  garden,  so  beautiful  are  its  lawns,  so  fine  its  roads,  so  clean  its  shrub- 
bery ;  a  hydrangea  or  two,  or  perhaps  some  other  brightly  colored  flower,  seems  all  to  be  required. 

A  splendid  house  on  top  of  a  hill  is  apt  to  be  a  bit  isolated.  Mr.  Poor  promptly  argued 
that,  if  there  were  not  room  at  the  top,  he  would  make  room  by  building  up  his  mountain  until 
he  had  space  sufficient  and  to  spare.  So  the  outer  corner  of  his  flower  garden  is  supported  by 
a  high  wall,  giving  him  as  much  space  as  he  desired  on  the  summit,  and  a  corner  of  the  globe 
that  he  has  made  his  very  own. 

It  is  a  lovely  spot,  arranged  in  terraces  that  gradually  diminish  in  elevation,  but  still 
kee]:)ing  well  to  the  summit  on  which  the  house  stands.  It  contains  two  fountains,  both  old 
and  European — one  with  a  bronze  summit,  the  other  wholly  of  stone.  And  of  pots  and  well 
heads,  of  carved  benches  and  ornaments,  of  bay  trees  and  curious  plants,  of  roses,  dahlias, 
and  other  plants  of  bloom  and  foliage,  there  is  a  plenty.  It  is  a  cleverly  designed  garden 
too;  for,  although  the  total  area  is  not  large  as  large  gardens  go,  the  apparent  size  is  most 
considerable.  It  is  a  charming,  lovely  open  space,  with  the  eternal  view  beyond,  this 
strange,  gentle,  quiet  forest  land,  so  marvelously  peopled  with  modern  palaces,  so  thoroughly 
subdued  by  American  civilization,  and  yet  still  retaining  the  rare  beauty  of  its  natural  state — 
this  wonderful  contrast  of  man  and  nature!

"Biltmore" 

The   Estate   ot    George  W.  Vanderbilt,  Esq.,  in    North    Carolina 


T  is  a  flattering  comment  on  the  architectural  splendor  of  Biltmore  that,  while  Mr. 
Vanderbilt's  great  house  is  not  new  as  new  houses  are  now  counted,  public  interest 
in  it  as  the  greatest  of  American  country  houses  has  never  languished.     Its  building 
has  been  followed  by  the  opening  up  of  a  long  unknown  country,  and  the  develop- 
ment of  countrv  activities  and  interests  on  a  scale  never  before  attempted  in  America. 

The  house  is  as  completely  without  rivals  as  is  the  estate.  It  stands  on  a  sjmr  of  a  hill 
which  has  been  leveled  to  make  space  for  it,  overlooking  the  French  Broad  River.  It  commands 
what  is  surely  one  of  the  most  magnificent  views  in  the  world,  a  succession  of  hills  and  valleys 
and  rolling  country  of  almost  limitless  extent,  reaching  as  far  as  the  eye  can  see,  stretching

indefinitely  off  into  a  region  filled  with  beautiful  spots,  and  with  suggestions  of  other  l)eauties, 
unseen,  yet  suggested. 

This  is  the  su]3renie  attraction  of  Biltmore — the  wonderful  scenery — for  the  house  has 
a  site  that  at  once  commands  the  loveliest  views,  and  gives  it,  as  a  dwelling,  the  best  possible 
situation  and  the  greatest  advantage. 

The  circumstances  that  led  to  the  foundation  of  this  great  estate  are  well  known.  Mr. 
Vanderbilt  was  attracted  to  it  by  its  wonderful  scenery  and  fine  climate.  The  accumulation 
of  land  proceeded  at  a  rapid  rate,  until  now  the  estate  comprises  an  area  of  one  hundred  and 
forty-seven  thousand  acres.  Statistics  are  uninteresting  and  perhaps  of  little  value,  and  yet 
unless  the  size  of  this  great  property  is  realized  its  ver}-  untxsual  character  will  not  becom])re- 
hended.  To  say,  therefore,  that  the  park  contains  thirty-eight  miles  of  macadamized  drives, 
seventy  of  wagon  road,  and  two  hundred  and  sixty-five  miles  of  trails  in  the  forests,  is  to  express 
more  than  commonplace  facts,  but  offers  a  guide  to  determining  the  scale  of  the  property. 

Biltmore  comprises  two  parts — the  home  grounds  and  the  estate.  The  home  grounds 
are  in  the  immediate  vicinitv  of  the  house,  as  the  name -implies,  and  thev  have  been  treated 
with  much  elaboration  of  detail,  with  terraces  and  gardens,  and  gardens  again  descending 
down  the  slopes,  and 
including  among  other 
interesting  features  an 
old  English  garden,  with 
fruit  trees  trained  against 
the  walls,  a  fascinating 
spot  and  a  trulv  delight- 
ful one. 

As  for  tlie  estate. 
Nature  there  is  still  Na- 
ture, and  perhaps  will 
always  be  so.  The  area 
is  much  too  large  to  l)e 
reduced  to  formal  treat- 
ment, and  much  of  it 
would  lose  its  present 
grandeur  if  subjected  to 
cultivation.  As  a  matter 
of  fact,  the  fviture  of 
Biltmore  will  be  a  mat- 
ter of  development.  Mr. 
Vanderbilt,  as  is  well 
known,    is   deeplv   inter-

ested  in  arboriculture,  and  has  already  established  an  arboretum  which  ranks  among  the  most 
extensive  in  the  world.  Here  forest  culture  is  carried  out  on  the  largest  scale  yet  attempted 
in  this  country;  a  school  of  forestry  is  in  active  operation,  and  many  valuable  results  have 
already  been  obtained. 

And  in  this  lies  one  of  the  chief  characteristics  of  this  estate — its  vast  size  enables  most 
extensi\-e  experiments  in  ]ilant  and  tree  life  to  be  carried  out  on  it.  These  experiments  all  have 
an  economic  value,  for  the  owner's  idea  is  not  to  experiment  for  the  sake  of  experimenting, 
but  to  obtain  results  of  positive  value  that  will  be  helpful  not  alone  to  the  management 
of  this  pro])erty,  but  which  will  be  available  to  landowners  and  land  cultivators  throughout 
the  entire  country.  Much  has  already  been  done  in  these  directions,  and  much  more  will 
doubtless  be  done.  But  it  is  a  notable  fact  that  this  great  estate  is  not  kept  ttp  as  a  place 
of  pure  enjoyment  for  its  owner,  but  it  is  intended  to  be  a  great  practical  college  in 
agriculture  and  forestry.  And  so  it  is  that,  while  planned  as  a  private,  personal  estate,  it  has 
already  become  a  national  institution,  whose  value  to  the  country  at  large  increases  each  year. 

Mr.  Vanderbilt  has,  and  perhaps  wisely,  chosen  to  regard  the  interior  of  his  magnificent 
dwelling  as  personally 
belonging  to  himself. 
Freely  permitting  the 
photographing  of  the 
exterior,  he  looks  upon 
the  interior  as  having 
interest  only  to  himself 
and  his  friends. 

"  Biltmore  "  suggests, 
but  does  not  reproduce, 
historic  models.  It  em- 
ploys historic  ideas  and 
familiar  motifs,  but  it 
employs  them,  as  the 
great  architects  of  the 
great  periods  of  archi- 
tecture have  done,  as  the 
models  and  tools  at 
hand.  Just  as  each^Gothic

one,  and  most  of  all  to  the  designers  of  those  times,  so  here  the  most  beautiful  ideas  are 
employed,  but  employed  afresh  and  in  a  new  way. 

The  open  stairway  at  Biltmore  recalls,  as  it  was  doubtless  intended  to  recall,  the  great 
stair  at  Blois;  luit  it  recalls  it  only  as  an  octagonal  stair  lighted  by  many  windows  must  recall 
it.  One  can  not  get  away  from  the  original  structure,  but  the  stair  at  Biltmore  is  not  the 
less  an  individual  creation,  distinctive  and  modern.  And  the  same  may  be  said  of  the 
house  as  a  whole.  It  resembles  a  French  chateau,  since  that  resemblance  was  intended. 
Yet  it  is  familiar  in  suggestion  only,  for  it  is  a  new  and  original  composition,  designed  by  an 
American  architect  for  American  surroundings.  It  is  a  wonderful  example  of  the  proper  use 
of  historic  precedent. 

The  house  speaks  for  itself.  It  is  a  great  house  of  a  great  estate,  and  as  such  it  stands 
alone  among  the  great  houses  of  America.  It  expresses  that  idea  ver}^  fully,  and,  if  it  expresses 
it  well  and  artistically,  it  surely  has  achieved  a  very  marked  success.  Nothing  has  been 
spared,  neither  within  nor  without  the  house,  nor  in  the  large  private  grounds  that  stu'round 
it,  that  might  add  to  its  beauty  or  make  it  admirable  as  a  place  of  residence.

"Faulkner  Farm" 

Mrs.   Charles    F.   Sprague's    House,   Brookline,   Massachusetts 


ITATELINESS  is  surely  the  character  note  of  the  great  house  of  "Faulkner  Farm." 
It  is  a  design  that  combines,  in  a  very  marked  degree,  the  qualities  of  dignity, 
sobriety,  and  beauty,  the  three  qualities  essential  to  successful  building,  in  a  fine 
architectural  ensemble.  It  is  a  house  of  great  size,  with  wings  and  outbuildings 
that  themselves  cover  almost  as  much  area  as  the  great  central  structure ;  but  it  is  a  building 
that  attracts  one  by  its  very  dignified  parts,  and  the  thoroughly  successful  wav  in  which  a  simple, 
direct,  and  straightforward  use  of  good  forms  and  the  employment  of  good  materials  have  been 
joined  in  producing  an  effect  that  is  at  once  grandiose  and  without  effort  or  undue  enrichment. 
The  garden,  which  forms  so  fine  a  feature  of  the  place,  was  designed  and  arranged  by 
Mr.  Charles  A.  Piatt  after  the  house  and  a  good  deal  of  the  structural  work  on  the  grounds 
had  been  built.  No  doubt,  from  the  landscape  architect's  standpoint,  this  entailed  certain 
disadvantages,  since  perfect  freedom  of  design  was  denied  him;  but  of  the  artistic  success  of  the 
garden  there  can  be  no  doubt. 
From  the  designer's  stand- 
point there  may  not  be  that 
thorough  unit}^  which  rightly 
pertains  to  every  great  art 
work;  from  the  visitor's  stand- 
point there  can  be  only  delight 
that  so  charming  a  garden  was 
created  in  this  lovely  place. 

"Faulkner  Farm"  is  a 
large  estate,  with  the  varied 
i-ural  industries  that  belong  to 
such  a  property.  The  garden, 
however,  is  in  immediate  prox- 
imity to  the  house,  and  its 
design  necessitated  the  com- 
plete transformation  of  the 
grounds  in  near  juxtaposition 
to    it.       The    general    plan    is

simple.  \The  hotise  is  a  vast  rectangle.  A  broad  drive  leads  up  before  one  front,  where  is 
a  great  graveled  forecourt,  that  affords  ample  space  for  waiting  carriages.  Beyond  it — to 
one's  right  as  one  drives  up  to  the  house — is  a  grove  of  trees,  largely  planted  here  as 
a  part  of  the  general  scheme,  and  adorned  with  a  fountain  at  each  end.  The  central  path 
leads  up  to  a  beautiful  circular  temple,  which  stands  on  a  level  space  on  the  apex  of  the  hill 
on  which  the  house  is  built. 

The  formal  garden,  the  Italian  garden,  is  to  the  right  of  the  house.  It  is  not  too  large, 
measuring  two  hundred  by  one  hundred  and  thirteen  feet,  but  it  is  ample  in  size,  and  the  spirit 
of  the  Italian  garden,  as  well  as  its  forms,  has  been  translated  to  this  fine  New  England 
hillside. 

At  the  farthest  point  from  the  house,  and  marking  the  limits  of  the  garden,  is  the 
Casino,  a  graceful  structure,  entirely  unenclosed  on  the  garden  front,  and  decorated  within  in 
the  Pompeian  style  in  colors,  a  novel  and  effective  decoration.  Before  it  is  a  pool  with 
a  fountain,  and  on  either  side  stretch  the  columns  and  piers  of  the  pergola. 

Architecture  comes  into  use  only  in  the  boundary  enclosure;  but  it  is  employed  in 
strong,  graceful  lines,  in  well-built  walls,  in  admirably  proportioned  columns,  in  sturdy  piers. 
The  Casino  is  at  once  a  summer  house  and  a  retreat,  and  the  climax  to  the  garden  as  a  whole. 
The  pool  before  it  brings  the  charm  of  water  into  the  garden,  a  charm  penetrating  and  real; 
The  whole  of  the  space  other- 
wise unoccupied  is  given  to  the 
garden  proper,  to  the  plants 
and  shrubs  which  make  it 
joyous,  and  to  the  art  works 
which  give  it  life.  The  foliage 
is  chiefly  that  of  perennials, 
but  ample  space  has  been  left 
for  annual  plants,  and  many 
brilliant  notes  of  color  are  won 
by  this  combination  of  natural 
growth.  The  garden  contains 
not  a  few  furnishings  in  the 
form  of  old  wine  jars  from 
Italy,  well  heads  from  Venice, 
classic  busts,  carved  stonework 
and  balustrades.  Each  has 
been  placed  with  care,  and  for 
specific  purpose  in  adornment.

The  House  of  Stanford  White,  Esq. 

St.  James,  New  York 


jN  old  house  once  occupied  a  part  of  the  ground  on  which  Mr.  White  has  l:)uilt  his 
house;    a  portion  of  it  has  been  retained,  but  so  transformed  and  modified  as  to  be 

entirely  lost  in  the  present  house,  which  is  thus  practically  an  entireh-  new  building. 

Three  gables,  front  and  back,  form  the  striking  feature  of  the  exterior,  the  service 
wing  to  the  right  being  recessed  on  the  front,  and  not  counting  in  the  impression  received  from 
the  entrance  road.  The  walls,  including  the  gables,  are  pebbled  throughout,  the  quoins  of 
white  cement,  the  woodwork  painted  white.  The  kitchen  wing  is  wholly  enclosed  on  all  sides 
by  a  close  lattice  of  delicate  wood,  a  device  that  gives  plenty  of  air  and  shade,  and  thoroughly 
shuts  off  this  part  from  the  inquisitive  eye  of  the  passer-by. 

The  whole  exterior  is  embowered  with  plants— great  boxes  of  hydrangeas,  palms,  bay 
trees,  oleanders,  and  many  mimic  trees  from  Japan,  most  of  them  in  their  own  jars  or  vases,

some  of  which  are  rare  old  works  of  art.  Below  the  side  porch  is  the  Italian,  or  formal,  garden. 
It  lies  beyond  a  terrace  wall,  and  is  small,  but  brilliant  with  color.  It  is  square,  with  walks 
bounded  with  box,  and  an  outer  higher  box  border  for  a  final  enclosure.  In  the  center  is 
a  large  circular  basin  and  fountain,  with  a  stooping  Venus  in  the  middle.  Farther  down, 
below  a  lower  terrace,  is  the  pergola  which  closes  the  garden  beyond  which  are  the  trees  of 
the  forest.  Across  the  roadway  is  a  smaller  enclosed  garden,  ablaze  with  hardy  phlox, 
a  brilliant  mass  of  bloom,  with  lofty  dahlias  beyond. 

A  wonderful  view  may  be  had  from  the  inner  porch,  a  view  so  broad  and  entrancing 
that  even  Long  Island,  with  its  host  of  pleasant  spots,  can  scarcely  equal  it.  To  the  farthest 
right  stretches  Crane  Neck  Point,  that  reaches  far  out  into  Long  Island  Sound.  Immediately 
below  one  is  Stony  Brook  Harbor,  and,  beyond,  the  quiet  waters  of  Smithtown  Harbor;  and 
then,  farther  on,  the  blue  waters  of  the  Sound,  filling  in  the  horizon.  All  this  is  at  one's  feet; 
but  before  it  can  be  reached  one  must  cross  a  gently  swelling  lawn,  that  spreads  in  delightful 
green  to  the  forests  and  low  bushes  which  entirely  surround  its  distant  borders.  Far  off,  and 
quite  some  distance  below  the  house — whose  altitude  is  exceeded  by  but  two  other  spots  on 
Long  Island — is  a  Grecian  temple,  a  graceful  circular  structure  with  Doric  columns,  whence 
one  mav  view  in  quiet  and  peace  the  waterscape  below,  or  look  upward  toward  the  house  and 
lawn  at  one's  back.

On  a  pleasant  knoll,  not  far  off  and  shaded  by  trees,  is  a  great  semicircular  seat,  and 
just  before  it  is  a  white  rei^roduction  of  the  Diana  designed  by  Mr.  Augustus  St.  Gaudens  for 
the  Madison  Square  Garden  tower. 

Roughly  speaking,  the  house  consists  of  three  parts.  To  the  right  is  the  kitchen  and 
service  department;  in  the  center  is  the  entrance  hall,  which  is  L-shaped,  enclosing  the  dining- 
room  on  two  sides ;  to  the  left  is  the  living-room,  a  vast  apartment  which  occupies  fully  a  third 
of  the  ground  floor. 

The  hall,  by  which  the  house  is  entered,  consists  of  two  parts.  One  portion  of  the  L  is 
a  corridor,  which  runs  directh'  through  the  house;  the  other,  at  right  angles  to  the  passage,  is 
a  large  rectangular  room  containing  the  stairs  to  the  upper  floor.  The  walls  are  entirely 
covered  with  split  bamboos,  a  novel  and  interesting  surface  covering  that  gives  a  quiet  note  of 
color  and  quite  distinguished  texture  of  surface.  The  bamboos  form  the  background  for 
a  rich  collection  of  objects  which  this  indefatigable  collector  has  gathered  from  all  parts  of 
Europe,  but  chiefly  from  Italy  and  Spain.  Arranged  against  the  side  wall  of  the  corridor  are 
twisted  Spanish  carved  columns,  six  in  ah,  standing  in  the  corners  and  on  each  side  of  the 


THE  LIVING-ROOM.

doorways  to  the  living-room.  Fine  tapestries  are  hung  on  either  side,  with  old  mirrors  in 
richly  carved  gilt  frames  and  many  curious  carved  ornaments. 

In  the  stair  hall  is  a  host  of  things.  Both  it  and  the  corridor  are  paved  with  dull  red 
enamel  bricks,  on  which  rich  Turkish  rugs  are  spread.  The  stairs  are  open  and  without 
banisters,  the  stair  wall,  like  the  other  parts,  being  covered  with  bamboo.  High  up  on  the 
outer  stair  wall  is  a  fine  figure  tapestry,  with  a  larger  example  on  the  hall  wall  below.  The 
mantel  is  treasure -trove  from  Italy — two  giants  upholding  a  decorated  cornice.  All  sorts  of 
trophies  are  hung  on  the  walls.  On  the  side  is  a  vast  carved  chest.  A  high  case  clock  stands 
just  beside  the  entrance  doorway.  There  is  some  yellow  covered  furniture  in  the  hall,  which, 
with  the  light  yellow  of  the  bamboo  walls  and  the  many  old  carved  and  gilded  ornaments, 
gives  a  joyous,  welcoming  color,  a  brilliant  opening  to  this  delightful  home. 

The  dining-room  is  white  in  tone  and  color.  Toward  the  lawn  it  is  wholly  lighted  with 
windows,  a  continuous  series  giving  a  rare  sense  of  openness  to  the  room.  A  low  seat  is  built 
below  them,  with  a  shelf  at  the  window  base,  and  on  it  is  a  host  of  jars,  bowls,  and  vases. 
Over  the  windows  are  plates  hung  against  the  wall,  plates  and  baskets  of  open  pottery  work, 
chiefly  of  Italian  origin,  and  many  of  large  size;  they  are  mostly  white  in  color.  The  two  side 
walls  are  paneled  in  small  square  wood  panels  with  shallow  mouldings,  all  painted  white. 
Here  are  more  plates,  delicate  in  color  and  in  texture  like  the  others;  mirrors,  also,  in  rich  gold 
frames,  round  and  oval  in  shape;  gilded  ornaments  of  carved  wood  likewise;  a  host  of  treasured

articles.  Against  the  farther  wall  is  a  fine  old  sideboard,  richly  furnished  with  silver  and  cut 
glass;  on  either  side  of  the  entrance  door  is  a  small  old  console,  decked  with  silver  and  china 
ornaments.  The  remaining  side  of  the  room,  which  is  directly  opposite  the  windows,  is  wholly 
covered  with  old  Dutch  tiles  in  white  and  blue.  In  accordance  with  the  old  Dutch  custom,  a 
curtained  shelf  rtms  across  the  top,  and  on  it  are  stood  more  things  of  interest— old  glass  bottles, 
a  colored  bust,  gilded  ornaments.  In  the  center  is  the  fireplace,  likewise  lined  with  tiles,  with 
open  iron  screen  in  front  and  quaint  Chinese  dogs  in  color  on  either  side.  An  old  carved 
serving  table  stands  on  one  side  by  the  service  entrance.     The  ceiling  is  white  plaster. 

That  the  floor  of  the  living-room  is  stained  and  spread  with  splendid  rugs;  that  the 
walls  are  of  bamboo,  largely  covered  with  tapestries;  and  that  the  ceiling  is  of  bamboo,  are 
facts  easily  grasped  and,  perhaps,  quickly  comprehended.  But  within  these  tapestried  walls 
and  beneath  this  bambooed  ceiling  are  gathered  a  veritable  wealth  of  curious,  beautiful  objects. 
There  are  fine  old  carved  chairs.       There  are  spacious  sofas  and  chairs  of  ease  and  of  state;

there  are  lamps  and  candelabra  of  all  sorts;  there  are  silver  lamps  dependent  from  the  ceiling; 
and  in  the  center  a  curious,  mermaid-like  affair,  with  branching  antlers  carrying  candles. 
There  are  mirrors  in  rare  old  frames ;  fine  old  pictures ;  ornaments  of  shell  and  beads ;  Persian 
blue  and  white  tiles  over  the  doors  to  the  side  porch;  carved  window  frames  from  Holland 
over  the  entrance  doors  from  the  hall ;  wonderful  Italian  twisted  columns — of  quite  rare  beauty 
and  elaborateness — stand  in  the  four  corners  of  the  room.  A  great  gilded  chest  is  between 
the  entrance  doorways,  and  is  loaded  with  numerous  beautiful  objects  in  metal  and  other 
materials ;  and  there  are  gilded  figures  and  carved  ornaments  hung  and  stood  where  some  note 
of  color  has  been  needed.  The  very  multiplicity  of  its  contents  speaks  not  alone  of  comfort, 
but  of  interest,  and  real,  living  interest,  in  everv^thing  it  contains.  If  Mr.  White's  house  is 
tmique — and  this  much  overworked  word  can  rightly  be  appHed  to  it— this  room  is  clearly  its 
most  tmique  part.

Mrs.  A.  Cass  Canfield's  House 

Roslyn,  New    York 


RS.  CANFIELD'S  house  is  a  building  of  vast  size,  all  of  brick,  red  with  spots  of 
black,  presenting  a  stately  spreading  front,  and  so  pleasantly  environed  with  lofty 
forest  trees  as  to  seem  to  be  just  the  sort  of  house  one  might  naturally  look  for  in 
this  lovely  spot.  It  consists  of  a  large  central  building,  three  stories  in  height,  with 
long  wings  on  either  side,  of  two  stories.  Its  proportions  are  dignified  in  the  extreme,  the 
whole  front  being  of  great  length,  while  the  additional  height  in  the  central  part  adds  very 
materially  in  the  majestic  effect.  It  is  a  front  that  depends  very  largely  on  its  dimensions, 
and  these  are  so  generous  and  good  as  to  give  it  at  once  a  distinction  wholly  its  own.  The 
single  note  of  ornament  is  the  main  doorway — pilasters  supporting  a  broken  curved  pediment. 
The  window  openings  are  bricked  over  with  a  small  stone  keystone,  and  the  cornice,  both  of 
the  center  and  the  wings,  is  surmounted  by  a  balustrade.  So  much  skill  has  been  displayed  in 
disposition  of  the  parts  forming  this  front,  the  masses  of  the^  building  are  so  well  composed 
the  proportions  so  good,  the  spacing  of  the  windows  so  clever,  and  the  ornamental  features  so 
admirably  handled,  that  it  is,  as  a  whole,  a  front  of  quite  penetrating  attractiveness. 

A  spacious  platform,  paved  with  brick,  and  reached  by  stone  steps,  and  to  which  bay 
trees  in  great  pottery  jars  give  a  pleasant  note  of  color,  forms  the  approach  to  the  main  door- 
way. The  entrance  hall  is  rectangular;  it  is  white,  with  pilasters  on  the  wall  immediately  in 
front,  on  which  hangs  a  superb  tapestry;  rare  old  light  standards  are  fastened  on  either  side. 
On  each  side  of  the  entrance  is  a  recess  with  a  window.  To  the  right  is  a  separate  hall  contain- 
ing the  main  stairway,  and  then,  beyond  a  tapestried  curtain,  is  the  guest  wing,  the  whole  of 
the  right  wing,  both  on  this  floor  and  the  floor  above,  being  given  up  to  guest  rooms.  These 
are  charming  apartments,  beautifully  furnished,  the  walls  paneled  and  covered  with  fabrics  of 
delicate  colors,  and  the  rooms  arranged  in  suites,  with  their  attendant  bathrooms.  Just  inside 
the  door  is  a  sitting-room  in  green  for  the  bachelors,  who  are  lodged  on  the  first  floor.  A 
separate  stairway  to  the  upper  floor  and  a  separate  entrance  on  to  the  main  front  render  this 
wing  entirely  independent  of  the  other  parts  of  the  house,  from  which,  if  need  be,  it  can  be 
wholly  cut  off. 

The  wing  to  the  left  is  arranged  in  a  similar  manner,  and,  with  its  own  entrance  and 
stairs,  can  be  similarly  isolated.  This  part  of  the  house  is  especially  given  up  to  the  children, 
with  a  children's  dining-room  on  the  first  floor,  beyond  which  are  the  kitchen,  the  servants' 
hall,    the   pantries,    serving-rooms,    and   other   service   apartments.      The   upper  floor  is   the

children's  floor,  with  the  bedrooms  on  the  sunny  side  and  the  bathrooms  on  the  opposite  side 
of  the  corridor.  Large  rooms,  cheerful  colors,  pleasant  furniture,  and  quite  individual 
treatment  in  each  case  are  the  characteristics  of  these  attractive  apartments. 

The  main  rooms  of  the  house  are  on  the  south  front  of  the  central  Iniilding.  They  are 
three  in  number— the  library,  the  drawing-room  or  living-room,  and  the  dining-room.  The 
hvmg-room  fills  the  center,  the  other  two  opening  from  it  as  well  as  from  the  corridor,  which 
is  an  extension  of  the  entrance  hall.  The  library  is  in  oak,  paneled  to  the  ceiling,  with  round 
arched  windows,  and  arches  of  similar  form  over  the  niches  into  which  the  bookcases  are  built. 
Curtains  of  green  damask  over  lace  curtains  give  the  color  note.  The  mantel  is  of  green 
marble.  The  living-room  or  drawing-room  occupies  the  center  of  the  house;  its  open  end  is 
rounded  and  lighted  by  five  windows,  which  give  upon  a  terrace  without.  It  is  a  large  room,  of 
quite  unusual  form  and  richly  furnished.  The  walls  are  paneled  with  French  walnut,  with 
a  plaster  cornice  and  plain  ceiling.  The  curtains  are  of  red  damask,  the  furniture  of  red  and 
gold  and  of  tapestry,  and  the  screens  of  red  silk,  red  thus  being  the  prevailing  color.  Side 
candle  lights  project  from  many  of  the  panels.  The  mantel  of  mottled  marble  has  a  built-in 
mirror  above  it.  The  furniture  is  both  old  and  new,  the  former  numbering  many  articles  of 
unusual  beauty  and  rarity,  including  a  fine  old  French  writing-table,  old  French  cabinets,  and 
other  pieces.  The  dining-room  is  white,  with  the  panels  of  the  walls  separated  by  pilasters, 
enclosing  plain  panels  of  a  very  delicate  buff.  Rich  blue  curtains  at  the  windows  give  the 
distinctive  color.  The  mantel  is  of  soft  yellow  Italian  marble.  On  the  walls  are  portraits  of 
General  Lewis  Cass  and  Mrs.  Cass  and  of  Mrs.  Canfield.  The  sideboard  is  a  fine  piece  of  old 
oak,  elaborately  carved. 

Mrs.  Canfield's  own  rooms  are  immediately  above  in  the  second  storv.  They  comprise 
two  bedrooms,  with  the  boudoir  directly  between  them  and  over  the  living-room.  Like  it,  it 
has  a  circular  window.  It  is  a  beautiful  apartment,  the  walls  covered  with  wood  panels 
throughout ;  the  windows  hung  with  curtains  of  Rose  du  Barry  pink  and  white ;  the  furniture 
and  ugs  in  quiet  harmony  with  the  delicate  treatment  of  the  architectural  features.  Mrs. 
Canfield's  bedroom  is  square  and  white  paneled;  a  deep  blue  carpet  is  on  the  floor,  and  the 
hangings  are  light  mauve  and  blue.  The  bedroom  on  the  other  side  is  finished  in  green,  with 
green  silk  panels  and  curtains.  The  house  contains  a  number  of  historical  relics  and  docu- 
ments of  the  highest  interest.  The  terrace  at  the  back  is  suj.iported  by  a  brick  wall,  in  harmony 
with  the  structure  of  the  building.  Large  vases  stand  on  the  enclosing  wall  and  steps,  and 
just  l)elow  is  a  pleasant  border  of  rose  bushes.  The  ground  dips  suddenly  here,  with  a  great 
green  field  beyond,  and  then,  as  far  as  eye  can  see,  stretch  the  undulating  farm  lands  of  the 
adjacent  countryside,  with  the  Hempstead  plains  in  the  distance.  It  is  an  entrancing  outlook 
upon  a  smiling  landscape  of  gentle  woods,  green  fields,  and  thriving  farms.

The  House  of  Foxhall  Keene,  Esq.,  Old  Westbury,  New  York 

|R.  KEENE'S  house  at  Old  Westbury,  Long  Island,  is  finely  placed  on  the  summit 

of  a  hill,  with  beautiful  rolling  country  in  the  foregrotmd,  while  behind  is  a  thick 

growth   of  trees,  in  which   the  stable   is   placed.        It   stands  on  a  terrace,  broad 

enough  to  give  space  to  a  house  garden  and  to  pi-ovide  a  floral  setting  for  the  fine 

Colonial  dwelling  placed  upon  it.     It  is  strong  and  sturdy  in  its  simple  lines,  all  in  white,  and 

with  a  splendid  portico  which  rises  to  the  roof.      It  is  a  well-composed  front,  of  dignified 

proportions,  very  charmingly  placed  on  the  edge  of  a  wood. 

The  plan  is  ^evy  direct  and  straightforward,  consisting  of  a  central  hall,  reaching  from 
front  to  back,  from  which  four  spacious  rooms  open,  two  on  each  side,  the  drawing-room  and 
library  on  the  front,  the  dining-room  and  billiard-room  at  the  back.  The  hall  is  entered  imme- 
diately from  the  main  doorway,  without  the  interposition  of  a  vestibule.  It  is  in  red  and  white, 
each  tone  very  clear  and  positive.  The  high  paneled  wainscoting  is  continuous  with  the 
door  trim,  which  includes  decorated  pilasters  and  an  ornamental  heading.  The  mantel  and 
chimneypiece  are  elaborately  detailed,  and  over  the  fireplace  is  the  motto  of  the  house:  "Rose- 
mary, that's  for  remembrance."  The  stairs  at  the  end  are  very  cleverly  arranged  as  a  decorative 
feature,  and  add  greatly  to  the  interest  of  the  hall.  Beginning  in  the  center,  they  divide  half- 
way up  at  a  platform  below  a  triple  window,  and  continue  reversed  on  each  side  to  the  upper 
floor.  The  light,  delicate  handrail  is  in  keeping  with  the  Colonial  character  of  the  house.  The 
spaces  beneath  the  upper  flights  are  enclosed,  and  serve  as  pantries  and  entrances  to  the  kitchen 
l:)elow. 

The  rooms  that  open  from  the  hall  are  alike  in  dimensions,  and  so  spacious  that  the 
really  high  ceilings  seem  somewhat  low.  Each  has  its  own  color  scheme,  very  boldly  carried 
out.  The  drawing-room  is  white,  paneled  in  wood  throughout,  with  a  white  plaster  ceiling,  with 
an  oval  enclosed  within  a  festooned  frame.  The  mantel  has  an  elaborately  detailed  framing, 
with  a  built-in  mirror,  muUioned  and  traceried  like  a  window.  There  are  curtains  of  rich  red 
damask  at  the  windows  and  doors,  and  the  furniture  is  in  red  and  gold.  The  piano,  in 
Italian  walnut,  was  especially  made  by  Steinway  for  this  room,  and  approximates  an  old  spinet 
as  closely  as  possible.  It  is  beautifully  ornamented  inside  with  an  Adams  decoration.  A  wide 
doorway,  with  pilasters  and  columns,  opens  into  the  adjoining  dining-room,  whose  deep  dark 
tones  are  in  fine  contrast  with  the  more  brilliant  colors  of  the  drawing-room.  It  is  finished 
in  mahogany,  handsomely  paneled  to  a  height  of  about  seven  feet,  with  carved  figures  in  the 
upper  piers.     The  walls  above  are  covered  with  dark  green  figured  damask,  the  same  material

being  used  for  the  curtains.  The  large  chimneypiece  of  wood  is  enclosed  within  columns, 
and  similar  columns  support  the  door-frame.  The  chandeliers,  which  hang  from  the  corners 
of  the  ceiling  decoration,  are  gilt  baskets  containing  bunches  of  white  and  purple  grapes. 

The  library  is  richly  stocked  with  books,  contained  in  the  cases  which  entirely  surround 
the  lower  walls.  Above  is  tapestry,  light  brown  in  tone,  with  a  closely  designed  tree  pattern 
in  shades  of  dark  green.  The  curtains  at  the  doors  and  windows  are  of  the  same  material. 
There  is  an  old  carved  mantel  and  fireplace.  The  billiard-room  is  in  the  deepest  shade  of 
purple.  The  ceiling  is  beamed,  and  the  immense  fireplace  has  a  large  overmantel,  with 
upper  columns  and  a  carved  centerpiece.  The  built-in  seats  and  chairs  are  covered  with 
purple  leather,  and  the  rug  and  curtains  are  of  the  same  hue.  Both  the  billiai'd-i-oom  and 
the  library  open  on  to  a  side  porch  which  overlooks  the  flower  garden. 

The  garden  is  placed  at  the  foot  of  a  series  of  terraces,  and  is  reached  by  flights  of  steps, 
bordered  on  either  side  by  low  flowering  plants  and  rows  of  box.  It  is  planted  in  formal  style, 
but  is  without  architectural  adjuncts.  It  is  a  great  square,  located  on  a  level  tract  just  before 
the  deep  woods  which  bound  the  property  at  this  point.  It  is  ablaze  with  bloom,  a  quaint 
and  beautiful  flower-spot  of  penetrating  brilliancy.  A  commanding  feature  is  the  poles  on 
the  sides  and  scattered  through  the  flower-beds,  which  are  completely  covered  with  profusely 
blooming  white  clematis — a  very  beautiful  decoration  in  a  very  beautiful  garden.

"All  View" 

House  of  C.  Oliver  Iselin,  Esq.,  Premium  Point,  New  Rochelle,  New  York 

HETHER  taken  in  its  most  literal  sense  or  not,  Mr.  Iselin  has  devised  a  very  happy  and 
delightfully  descriptive  name  for  his  house  in  New  Rochelle,  New  York.  A  garden  by 
the  waterside  would  be  equally  expressive,  for  his  house  stands  on  the  tip  of  Premium 
Point,  which  juts  out  into  Long  Island  Sound  at  New  Rochelle,  and  gives  it  a  water 
view  at  once  extensive  and  beautiful.  Very  lovely  and  peaceful  it  is  here,  with  the  gentle 
calm  of  rippling  water  softly  washing  the  green  shores,  with  their  low  rocked  points — a  coast 
thronged  with  strange-shaped  stretches  of  land  into  the  water,  as  though  both  land  and  water 
had  fought  for  supremacy,  and  then  rested  in  the  quiet  beauty  which  now  so  distinguishes 
them.  There  is  no  solitary  outlook  here,  but  one  of  ravishing  variety,  the  land  and  water  so 
intermingled  that  it  is  hard  to  tell  if  one  be  island  or  peninsula,  the  other  bay  or  river,  lake 
or  sound — a  landscape  dotted  with  pleasant  houses,  enclosed,  in  the  background,  with  groups 
and  groves  of  trees. 

Mr.  Iselin  has  for  his  house,  therefore,  almost  every  possible  qualification  of  beauty  in 
its  surroundings.  A  dwelling  so  environed  must  be  stately  and  fine,  and  the  architect  has 
risen  to  the  full  measure  of  his  opportunity.  The  splendid  front  has  a  recessed  center,  with 
two  end  wings  slightly  projecting.  The  corners  of  these  wings  are  supported  by  immense 
pilasters,  which  rise  to  the  top  of  the  main  cornice.  The  uppermost  story  is  treated  as  an  attic, 
a  central  curve  in  the  wings  giving  space  for  a  window,  and  creating  a  fine  silhouette  for  the 
roof  line.  The  great  pilasters  are  so  completely  the  feature  of  the  wings,  and,  in  a  sense,  of 
the  whole  front,  that  the  windows  enclosed  within  them  are  plainly  framed  in  the  white  marble 
which  is  used  for  the  ornamental  parts  and  encased  in  the  walls  of  solid  brick. 

The  distinguished  severity  which  characterizes  the  end  pavilions  gives  way  in  the  center 
of  the  front  to  a  freer  and  more  ornamental  treatment.  The  central  wall  is,  indeed,  quite  festal  in 
character.  The  entrance,  in  the  center,  is  a  very  charming  structure  in  white  marble,  completely 
filling  the  space  occupied  by  the  ground  floor  and  the  story  above  it.  The  round  arched  opening 
is  supported  by  pilasters,  and  the  terrace  of  the  roof  is  enclosed  within  a  balustrade.  The 
doorway  under  the  porch  is  rectangular,  and  the  whole  is  finely  detailed  and  beautifully  executed. 
The  walls  of  the  two  upper  stories  are  treated  as  window-galleries :  two  on  each  side  of  the  porch 
in  the  first  story,  and  eight — a  beautifully  glazed  series — in  the  upper  story.  The  modest 
dormers  in  the  attic  are  in  good  contrast  with  the  bolder  treatment  of  the  ends. 

The  gardens  of  "All  View"  are  extraordinarily  fine,  and  their  own  great  inherent 
beauty  is  enhanced  by  their  close  juxtaposition  to  the  water.     The  large  formal  garden  is  entirely

enclosed  within  a  high  hedge,  grown  ahnost  on  the  very  edge  of  the  land.  It  is  a  great  rectangle, 
and  is  comparatively  simple  in  design — four  lawns  placed  around  a  central  circle,  each  lawn 
having  a  central  bed  of  flowers  and  being  surrounded  with  wide  borders.  Simple  as  the  plan 
is,  the  i^lanting  and  arrangement  have  been  so  admirably  done  that  its  very  simplicity  is  only 
apparent  on  the  closest  analysis.  Unlike  many  large  formal  gardens,  this  one  does  not  depend 
on  an  architectural  setting  for  its  effect.     It  is  formally  j^lanned  and  planted;    the  enclosing

hedge  has  all  the  character  of  a  wall,  l)ut,  save  for  the  marble  steps  and  some  minor  ornaments, 
the  garden  has  no  constructive  helps.  But  there  is  no  loss  because  of  this.  On  the  contrary, 
there  is  a  special  individuality  in  the  dependence  on  nature — on  plants  and  shrubs,  on  trees 
and  vines,  on  brilliant  blooming  flowers  placed  so  their  own  brilliant  colors  will  be  the  garden's 
greatest  joy.  The  rose  garden,  near  the  house,  is  a  spot  of  quite  unusual  beauty,  and  contains 
an  immense  quantity  of  plants,  cared  for  in  the  most  thorough  manner  and  brought  to  an  unusual 
degree  of  perfection.  It  is  difficult  to  characterize  the  beauties  of  so  lovely  a  place  as  this, 
but  it  is  clearly  a  fine  illustration  of  good  taste  in  gardening,  and  a  garden  of  strongly  marked 
individuality.

The  House  of  Lloyd  Bryce,  Esq. 


Roslyn,  New  York 


|R.   BRYCE'S  house  is  beautifully  situated  on  the  summit  of  a  hill,   covered  with 

rich  lawns,  bordered  by  the  forests  overlooking  the  waters  of  Hempstead  Harbor. 

It   is   simple   and  gracious   in   design,  so   spacious   and  well   proportioned   that  its 

size    is    not    at    first    apparent.        It    consists    of    a    large    central    building — the 

house  proper — ^with  two  wings  connected  with  the  main  striicture  by  short  galleries.       These 

pavilions  are  attached  to  the  garden  front,  and  do  not  form  a  feature  of  the  entrance  front. 

The  house  charms  and  satis- 
fies by  the  directness  of  its 
design,  the  simplicity  of  its  de- 
tail, and  the  dignity  of  its  pro- 
portions. The  brick  walls  are 
without  ornamental  treatment, 
save  for  the  broad  cemented 
quoins  that  are  needed  at  the 
angles  of  so  large  a  building  to 
give  strength  and  emphasis  to 
the  bounding  edges.  The  pro- 
portions of  every  part  are  fine; 
the  wall  spaces  are  ample, 
with  large  windows  generously 
spaced;  and  the  white  of  the 
corners,  the  entrance  doorway, 
the  hoods  and  sills  of  the  win- 
dows, and  the  cornice  which 
crowns  the  whole,  is  in  verv 
happy  contrast  with  the  red 
brick  of  which  the  house  is 
built.  The  outer  pavilions, 
which  form  so  interesting  a 
feature  of  the  garden  front, 
are  identical  in  design,  with 
rounded  openings  and  low  slop- 
ing roofs.  Arcaded  galleries 
of  round  arches  connect  them  THE  main  doorway.

with  the  main  building.  One  serves  as  the  kitchen;  the  other  is  an  open  room,  affording 
superb  outlooks  upon  the  land  and  water  beyond.  A  lake,  in  the  immediate  foreground, 
adds  to  the  charm  of  the  garden  side. 

The  house  has  a  stately  plan,  with  a  circular  vestibule  floored  with  marble,  and  with 
columns  of  polished  marble  supporting  the  ceiling.  On  each  side  is  a  rectangular  passage, 
or  antechamber,  with  the  library  beyond  to  the  right  and  the  drawing-room  to  the  left.  The 
dining-room  is  between  these  two,  its  windows  directly  opening  on  to  the  garden.  Both  library 
and  drawing-room  have  monumental  doorways  opening  into  their  antechambers. 

The  drawing-room  is  white,  with  walls  of  paneled  wood,  tinted  a  delicate  pearl  gray, 
with  dead-white  trimmings.  The  rich  red  damask  curtains,  and  the  gold  and  white  furniture 
covered  with  the  same  material,  give  the  needed  color.  The  room  contains  much  old  furniture 
here,  and  many  pieces  of  old  Chinese  red  lacquer,  which  are  quite  unique.  The  mantel  of 
Itahan  marble  is  delicately  carved,  and  a  crystal  chandelier  hangs  from  the  ceihng. 

The  stairs  are  placed  in  the  antechamber  to  the  library,  which  is  a  lovely  room,  not 
quite  so  large  as  the  drawing-room.  It  is  wainscoted  with  walnut,  which  gives  a  fine  contrast 
to  the  V)lue  curtains  that  determine  the  color  note  of  the  room.  Many  bookcases  are  built 
into  the  waUs,  but  space  is  found  for  some  choice  paintings.  The  mante  is  of  black  and  white 
marble;  above  it  hangs  a  fine  picture  by  Van  Loo.  Again  some  fine  old  furniture,  with  modern 
easy-chairs,  and  many  interesting  ornaments.  The  windows  on  the  side  open  on  to  a  terrace, 
with  a  flower  garden  beyond. 

The  dining-room,  like  the  others,  is  large,  with  wahs  of  green  and  old  gold,  very  subdued 
in  hue.  The  mantel  is  of  black  and  white  marble,  with  mirror,  clock,  and  candelabra  of  the 
Empire  period.  There  are  family  portraits  here,  including  one  of  Peter  Cooper,  and  some 
good  old  tapestries.  Just  outside  a  fountain  plays  gracefully  on  the  terrace,  and  across  the 
waters  of  Hempstead  Harbor  and  the  Sound,  which  lie  far  below,  is  the  dim  outline  of  the  West- 
chester coast.  It  is  a  scene  of  wonderful  beauty  and  peace,  an  outlook  on  to  Nature  at  her 
best — a  vision  of  undulating  lawn,  of  fine  forests,  of  distant  water. 

There  is  a  large  swimming  pool  near  the  house,  and  the  grounds  contain  two  tennis 
courts,  one  cemented  and  one  grassed;  and  not  far  from  the  house,  but  enclosed  within  high 
hedges,  is  a  garden  of  old-fashioned  flowers.  The  property  is  a  large  one,  comprising  about 
two  hundred  acres.     A  part  of  it  was  at  one  time  owned  by  William  Cullen  Bryant,  the  poet.

"The  Orchard" 

The    House   of  James    Lawrence    Breese,  Esq.,  Southampton,   New   York 


HE  word   "Hospitality"   is  writ  large  over  this  fine  mansion;    for  the  house  is  a 
mansion,   though  the  design  is  simple,   the  architecture  restrained,   the  decorative 
elements  refined  and  subdued.     An  old  house  which  once  stood  on  the  grounds  was 
moved  to  the  present  site,  a  house  that  scarcely  covered  more  than  the  space  now  occu- 
pied by  the  entrance  hall  and  the  library.     Its  low  ceilings  have  been  retained,  and  thus  the 

general  scale  set ;   but  the  house 

as  a  whole  is  an  entirely  new 

structure,    in   which   the   archi- 
tects  completely  responded  to 

the  ideas  of  the  owner,  with  the 

result    that    one    of    the    most 

delightful     and     individual     of 

Long  Island  country  places  has 

been   created — for   it   is   a   real 

creation,     and    more    than    an 

erection — on     the     rather     fiat 

land  which  is  characteristic  of 

Southampton. 

Outwardly  the  house  is  a 

frank    adaptation    of    the    old 

Southern     Colonial     house     to 

modern    requirements.       If     it 

recalls    one    model    more    than 

another,  it  is  perhaps  the  historic 

lines  of  Mount  Vernon  which  it 

suggests.     But   it   is   a   sugges- 
tion   only,    and    the  house  has 

been   planned   and   carried   out 

without    thought    of    copving, 

and    with    the    single    idea    of 

making     a     hospitable     place 

where  one  might  live  comfort- 
ably in   the   country,   entertain  "THE  ORCHARD"— THE  PORCH.

one's  friends,   and   engage  in  such   rural  sports  and  undertakings  as  a  man  of  wealth  and 
culture  might  naturally  be  interested  in. 

Mr.  Breese  has  Inult  regardless  of  space,  and  in  a  manner  that  is  best  described  as  ample. 
The  main  building  contains  but  two  rooms — a  music-room  and  a  library,  separated  bv  a  wide 
entrance  or  general  hall.  Beyond  these  is  a  rear  hall,  running  the  full  length  of  the  house  and 
connecting  the  two  main  wings;  on  the  right  is  the  studio,  with  a  squash  court  beyond;  on  the 
left,  the  dining-room,  breakfast-room,  and  kitchen,  with  servants'  quarters  still  farther  out. 
Each  of  these  latter  buildings  is  recessed  still  farther  away  from  the  central  axis,  so  that  the 
rear  of  the  building  surrounds  a  great  court,  open  at  the  farther  side  and  enclosed  on  the  three 
others. 

Hospitahty  and  livability  are  the  dominant  qualities  of  this  house.  Mr.  Breese  has  erected 
a  place  that  may,  in  many  senses — since  it  is  very  wonderful  and  wonderfully  interesting — be 
called  a  ' '  show  place ' ' ;  yet  he 
has  been  quite  indifferent  to 
splendor  in  his  search  for 
comfort,  convenience,  and  the 
pleasure  of  living  in  a  pleasant 
house.  His  rooms  are  delight- 
ful; low  ceiled,  agreeably  col- 
ored, tastefully  decorated  and 
furnished,  almost  completelv, 
with  genuine  old  mahogan}' 
pieces  picked  up  bv  himself, 
mostly  in  the  South. 

The  color  schemes  mav  be 
briefly  summarized.  Music- 
room — pale  green  silk  hangings 
and  wall  paper,  white  India 
rugs,  and  white  (polar)  bear 
skins;  main  hall — all  white 
paneling,  dark  red  India  rug; 
library — light  brown  hangings 
and  paper,  green  India  rug; 
rear  hall — wainscoted  below, 
reproductions  of  old  Colonial 
landscape  wall  paper  above,  in 
delightful  cool  gray  tones; 
dining-room — white  panels  to 
the    ceiling,    blue    decorations,  "THE  ORCHARD  "—WALL  FOUNTAIN.

the  walls  hung  with  brass  plaques  and  blue  Chinese  plates;  studio — but  that  deserves 
a  paragraph  of  its  own.  The  ceilings  are  throughout  of  old  Colonial  designs,  in  low  relief. 
The  mantels  are  chiefly  old  ones.  All  of  the  doors  on  the  first  floor  are  old  New  York 
doors  of  mahogany  cut  down  to  fit  their  present  places;  and  much  of  the  interior  trim  is 
genuinely  old.  The  house  is  absolutely  harmonious  and  in  the  best  of  taste.  It  is  frankly 
and  tnily  Colonial  in  character. 

The  two  wings  are  connected  with  the  main  portion  by  nan^ow  passageways:  the  one 
on  the  right  has  been  transformed  into  a  conservatory.  The  floor  is  glazed  with  old  Chinese 
tiles ;  the  ceiling,  arched  latticework ;  one  wall  contains  a  fine  old  Italian  fountain  picked  up  in 
Italy.  The  conservatory  forms  an  antechamber  to  the  studio,  which  is  entered  immediately 
through  it.  The  latter  is  the  most  elaborate  room  in  the  house.  It  is  paneled  in  California 
redwood;  above  are  large  decorative  panels — old  Flemish  paintings  on  canvas,  perhaps  designs 
for  tapestries,  but  very  beautiful  and  rich  in  color.  The  room  has  a  total  height  of  about  nine- 
teen feet,  and  is  ceiled  with  beams  of  California  redwood,  with  rough  white  plaster  between. 
The  floor  area  is  forty-five  feet  by  thirty  feet,  so  that  here  is  a  room  of  very  large  proportions, 
and  filled  with  a  host  of  beautiful  and  interesting  objects.  The  vast  fireplace  is  built  of  stones 
taken  from  the  foundations  of  the  old  house.  The  opening  is  over  six  feet  high  and  six  feet 
wide:   only  driftwood  is  burned  in  it,  and  the  flames  shoot  up  with  such  brilliancy  that  several

work.  The  ceiling  candelabra  are  likewise  old  Italian,  and  directly  from  the  center  hangs 
a  full-rigged  Dutch  ship,  a  metal  model  at  least  a  hundred  and  fifty  years  old.  The  stairs  at 
the  liack  of  the  studio  lead  to  the  billiard-room  above.  Beyond  are  a  dark-room,  a  gun-room, 
a  bic\"cle-room,  and  a  fjathroom,  connected  with  the  squash  court. 

The  rose  garden  is  just  beyond  the  porch  at  the  back  It  is  alwut  sixty  feet  square,  and 
fills  the  space  enclosed  by  the  wings  of  the  house.  In  the  center  is  a  graceful  fountain :  the  walks 
are  of  brick,  box  lined — a  lovely  and  beautiful  spot  of  flowers. 

The  pergola  stretches  back  from  it  on  either  side  full  two  hundred  feet;  bounded  on 
the  outer  edge  with  a  low  brick  wall,  above  which  rise  short  square  piers;  within,  a  row  of 
circular  columns,  the  whole  flat-roofed  with  natural  branches.  At  the  far  end  it  is  open  to 
the  ground,  with  double  rows  of  columns  opening  to  a  still  farther  vista  beyond.  The  space 
beyond  contains  the  vegetable  garden ;  but  the  central  path  is  lined  with  peach  trees  on  either 
side,  and  ultimately  it  is  proposed  to  extend  the  pergola  down  this  path  clear  to  the  bounding 
wall  of  the  property,  a  good  six  hundred  and  sixty  feet  from  the  house.  The  si)ace  within 
the  pergola  is  brightly  planted  with  hardy  shrubs  and  flowers,  so  selected  that,  throughout  the 
season,  there  will  l)e  a  constant  succession  of  bloom.     Without  it  is  a  similar  bed  along  the

enclosing  walls;  then  a  path,  and  the  trees  of  the  old  orchard,  which  happily  enough  fit  in 
perfectly  with  the  present  development  of  the  grounds. 

The  estate,  which  comprises  thirty  acres,  has  been  so  planned  that  the  house  and  garden 
stand  considerably  to  the  right  of  the  center  of  the  whole  property,  the  house  grounds  running 
right  through  from  the  main  road  to  the  boundary  of  the  farthest  end.  On  each  side  are  broad 
stretches  of  lawn;  the  old  trees  determined  the  location  of  the  house,  and  the  newer  plantings 
were  designed  to  assist  the  effect  of  the  original  growth.  To  the  left  of  the  main  entrance 
is  a  long  drive,  reaching  straight  back  to  the  stables  and  service  houses,  and  here,  well  beyond 
the  house  grounds  and  the  vegetable  garden,  are  grouped  the  l^uil dings  needed  for  the  culti- 
vation of  so  varied  an  estate. 

Here  are  the  gardener's  cottage,  corn  cribs,  ice  house,  machine  shop,  hotbeds,  carriage 
house  and  stable,  chicken  houses,  an  old  barn,  a  shooting  tower,  greenhouses,  and  other 
buildings,  among  which  the  garage  for  automobiles  should  not  be  forgotten,  the  plant  being  so 
complete  that  Mr.  Breese  is  able  to  carry  out  every  possible  work  in  connection  with  the 
automobile  repairing,  save  casting,  and  even  that  is  looked  forward  to  in  the  future.  The 
shooting  tower,  a  most  unusual  feature,  was  built  for  the  sport  of  shooting  clay  pigeons.

"The  Monastery" 

The    House  of   Charles   P.  Searle,  Esq.,  Swampscott,  Massachusetts 


HE  very  unusual  house  of  Mr.  Charles  P.  Searle,  at  Swampscott,  Massachusetts, 
attracts  attention  both  Ijy  the  novelty  of  its  design  and  its  very  extraordinary 
situation.  For  much  of  the  inner  part  of  the  house  overhangs  the  sea  in  a  quite 
literal  sense,  although  the  entrance  front,  embowered  in  large  trees,  hardly  suggests 
such  a  situation.  The  grounds  are  enclosed  with  a  stucco  wall,  whose  plainlv  cut  arches  and 
curved  crest  are  repeated  again  in  the  forms  of  the  entrance  porch.  Placed  as  it  is  on 
a  rock,  the  design  of  the  house  has  cahed  for  clever  planning,  with  an  adaptation  to  the  various 
levels  of  the  site,  and  an  economical  utilization  of  the  available  area.  The  color  scheme 
is  quite  unusual:  the  walls  are  gray,  the  roof  brilliant  red,  the  latticed  windows  pea  green.  The 
entrance  porch  is  applied  diagonally  to  the  main  structure,  and  faces  a  forecourt  within  the 
enclosing  wall. 

The  principal  door  opens  on  to  a  vestibule  in  green  and  white,  beyond  which  is  the  hall. 
This  is  a  great  \-aulted  apartment,  two  stories  in  height,  finished  in  a  very  unusual  and  original 
manner.  The  walls  are  pan- 
eled to  the  springing  of  the 
vault  arches,  and  colored 
French  gray ;  the  upper  walls 
are  entirely  filled  with  lattice- 
work of  pea  green.  There  is 
a  large  mantel  of  gray  stone, 
with  a  carved  overmantel, 
with  festoons  in  relief,  above. 
At  the  farther  end  are  the 
stairs,  partly  enclosed  within 
open  woodwork.  The  walls 
of  the  upper  landing  are  cov- 
ered with  palm-leaf  paper  in 
green  and  white;  the  balus- 
trade is  painted  green,  and  a 
green  carpet  is  laid  on  the 
stairs. 

A     few     steps     up     the 
stairs    is    the    morning-room,  "THE  MONASTERY"— THE  ENTRANCE  TO  THE  GROUNDS.

finished  in  the  same  way,  with 
palm-leaf  paper  and  with  green 
paint.  It  opens  on  to  a  large 
porch,  so  close  to  the  edge  of 
the  rock  that  the  water  is  prac- 
tically below  it.  The  dining- 
room  adjoins  the  morning- 
room,  and  is  finished  in  gray, 
with  green  wall  decorations. 
The  service-rooms  and  kitchen 
adjoin  the  dining-room  and  are 
continued  along  the  hall. 

Another  portion  of  the 
house  opens  to  the  right  of  the 
vestibule  and  hall.  Here  is  a 
small  stair  hall,  with  a  private 
stair  to  the  upper  floor.  Im- 
mediately adjoining  it  is  Mr. 
Searle's  room,  which  is  finished 

in  yellow.  It  has  a  tiled  mantel  and  paneled  seats.  Beyond  it,  with  a  large  doorway  opening 
into  the  hall,  is  the  music-room.  The  woodwork  is  painted  gray,  and  the  walls  are  covered  with 
pink  and  white  paper.  There  is  a  white  marble  mantel,  and  the  furniture  is  chiefly  antique. 
Curtains  of  pink  and  white  add  to  the  very  distinctive  cheer  and  charm  of  this  apartment. 


"THE  MONASTERY  "—THE  UPPER  HALL. 


[i86] 


The  House  of  Ogden  Mills,  Esq. 

Staatsburg,  New  York 

jHE  house  of  Mr.  Ogden  Mills,  at  Staatsbtirg,  New  York,  stands  on  a  high  bank 
overlooking  the  Hudson  River,  and  has  the  rare  advantage  of  a  lawn  that  sweeps 
down  to  the  water's  edge,  without  the  interruption  of  the  railroad  that  cuts  many 
of  the  fine  sites  on  the  river.  It  is  superbly  placed,  with  beautiful  outlooks  on  to 
the  almost  matchless  scenery  for  which  the  Hudson  is  famous.  The  old  Livingston  manor 
house  once  stood  tipon  this  site,  and  not  only  determined  the  location  of  the  j^resent  building, 
but  its  framework  formed  the  basis  of  its  structure,  which  has  been  built  aromid  it,  and  which 
served  as  the  nucleus  from  which  it  has  been  expanded. 

It  is  a  house  of  beautiful  stateliness  and  symmetry,  with  a  front,  which  faces  the 
river,  of  truly  monumental  proportions  and  grandeur — a  building  quite  Colonial  in  feeling  and 
expression,  but  larger  in  scale  and  of  more  academic  detail  than  the  older  house  which  preceded 
it.  It  is  a  front  of  great  length,  large  enough  to  be  impressive  through  sheer  size,  but  ver}- 
beautifully  composed,  and  proportioned  with  fine  grace  and  dignity.  In  the  center  is  a  portico 
of  six  great  columns  supporting  a  pediment,  a  feature  always  impressive  and  beautifril  when 
well  done,  and  here  carried  out  with  consummate  skill  and  ability.  Long  stretches  of  wall, 
containing  two  stories  of  windows,  support  it  on  either  side.  A  broad,  plain  cornice  is  carried 
wholly  around  the  top  of  the  wall,  and,  in  the  wings,  is  sui  mounted  with  a  balustrade.  The 
walls  are  perfectly  fiat,  without  structural  projections,  but  their  architectural  treatment  has 
been  designed  with  a  fine  realization  of  the  value  of  refined  surface  decoration.  At  each  end 
are  two  pilasters,  reaching  from  base  to  cornice,  and  spaced  so  that  a  window  opens  between 
each  pair.  The  window  frames  of  the  lower  story  are  surmounted  with  small  pediments  carried 
on  consoles;  those  of  the  upper  story  are  simply  outlined  in  a  bare  wall.  A  rectangular  panel 
is  sunk  above  the  central  window,  and  delicate  festoons  hang  above  the  adjoining  window 
on  either  side.  A  very  considerable  variety  is  thus  obtained  by  simple  means,  and,  since 
the  scale  of  the  building  is  so  large,  the  resultant  effect  is  at  once  fine  and  beautiful,  quite 
rich,  indeed,  and  yet  without  suggestion  of  overelaboration. 

The  scheme  of  the  wall  design  behind  the  portico  is  distinctly  different;  thoroughly 
individual,  yet  in  fioll  harmony  with  the  other  parts.  The  windows  here  are  in  three  tiers, 
the  upper  series  being  quite  low.  The  entrance  doorway  is  triple,  the  central  opening  having 
an  entablature  and  pediment  supported  on  columns,  while  the  side  open  ngs  are  enclosed  within 
pilasters.  The  pediment  above  the  central  opening  and  festoons  over  the  entire  group 
sufficiently  emphasize  the  importance  of  this  feature.     Festoons  appear  again  over  the  two

central  windows  of  the  second  story.  The  lower  windows  are  without  the  pediments  seen 
in  the  wings,  and  those  on  the  stairs  in  the  second  tier  are  quite  frankly  placed  exactly  where 
they  belong  and  out  of  symmetry  with  the  others.  This  is  an  interesting  illustration  of  the 
moderate  freedom  with  which  the  architectural  parts  have  been  handled. 

The  interior  of  the  house  is  thoroughly  in  keeping  with  its  majestic  exterior.  The  rooms 
are  of  great  size,  as  may  be  expected  in  a  house  of  such  dimensions,  and  they  are  handsomely 
finished  and  furnished.  The  great  hall  is  paneled  with  wood  in  a  somewhat  simple  design, 
l)ut  it  is  a  very  beautiful  room.  The  woodwork  of  the  ceiling  follows  the  general  motif  of 
the  paneled  walls.     It  is  abundantly  furnished,  and  contains  some  historic  family  portraits. 

The  chief  rooms  of  the  house  connect  directly  with  the  hall.  These  constitute  the  series 
of  apartments  usual  in  dwellings  of  this  type.  The  dining-room,  which  has  been  chosen  for 
illustration,  is  a  good  example.  It  is  a  vast  rectangular  apartment,  paneled  with  colored  marble 
throughout,  the  cornice  on  the  longer  sides  being  supported  by  pilasters.  Magnificent  tapestries 
form  the  leading  feature  of  the  wall  decorations.  They  are  stretched  within  frames,  placed 
in  the  center  of  each  wall,  and  are  finely  spaced  within  ample  surrounding  surfaces.  The  ceiling 
is  richly  detailed,  with  a  great  central  circle  and  smaller  circles  at  either  end.  The  lights  are 
girandoles  and  standards  placed  in  the  corners.  The  dehcately  carved  and  decorated 
side  tables  placed  against  the  walls  are  beautiful  pieces  of  furniture.

"  Belief  ontaine" 

The   Estate  of  Giraud   Foster,  Esq.,  Lenox,  Massachusetts 


|R.  Giraud  Foster's  house,  at  Lenox,  Massachusetts,  is  a  wonderful  house  in  a  wonderful 

place.     The  landscape  of  the  Berkshire  Hills  is  so  very  lovely  that  the  art  of  man 

is  hardly  needed  to  add  to  its  beauty;   but  Mr.  Foster  has,  in  his  splendid  house  and 

beautiful  gardens,  added  a  new  note  of  loveliness  to  Lenox,  and  created  a  fresh  spot 

of  interest  that  is  almost  without  parallel  in  the  extraordinary  care  and  exquisite  art  that  have 

been  lavished  upon  it. 

The  house  and  grounds  constitute  the  component  parts  of  a  single  creation,  in  which 
each  bears  a  definite  relationship  to  the  other.  The  house  is  so  large  and  so  sumptuous  in  its 
materials  and  its  design  as  to  be  rightly  described  as  palatial.  It  consists  of  a  vast  central  build- 
ing with  two  wings,  that  form  an  open  court  on  one  side.  The  south  front  has  for  its  chief  motif 
a  great  portico,  supported  by  Corinthian  columns,  rising  to  the  full  height  of  two  stories  and 
embracing  the  three  central  windows.  The  adjoining  walls  contain  each  two  windows,  separated 
by  so  wide  a  space  that  room  is  found  for  an  ornamental  slab  between  those  of  the  upper  story. 
The  house  is  built  of  brick  and  marble,  but  the  brick  is  quite  subordinated,  the  whole  of  the 
central  part  of  the  south  front  being  marble.  A  high  balustrade  is  carried  around  the  top  of 
the  building,  partly  concealing  the  attic,  which  forms  the  third  story  of  the  center.  The  building 
is  finished  with  a  loggia  at  each  end. 

The  north  front  is  less  grandiose  in  design,  but  very  full  of  interest.  Two  low  wings 
project  from  the  main  structure,  that  on  the  east  being  a  palm-room  and  entrance,  that  on  the 
west  the  kitchen  and  servants'  quarters.  In  their  inner  corners  are  square  towers,  integral 
parts  of  the  house,  which  is  here  three  stories  in  height.  The  leading  motif  is  the  round  arch, 
which  appears  in  every  part — in  the  loggias  on  the  ends,  in  the  ends  of  the  wings,  on  the  two 
exposed  faces  of  the  towers,  and  the  three  arches  of  the  center.  With  the  exception  of  the  side 
walls  of  the  wings,  all  of  the  first  story  is  of  marble ;  the  upper  walls  are  of  brick,  with  marble 
trimmings,  and  the  third  story  of  the  towers  is  again  of  marble. 

Obviously,  the  south  front  is  the  front  of  state  and  of  honor,  and  the  north  front  is  the 
home  front;  yet  neither  contains  an  entrance  doorway.  The  chief  entrance  is  through  the  palm- 
room,  and  is  indicated  by  a  marquise  of  wrought  iron,  very  original  and  striking  in  design, 
which  is  placed  before  a  round  arched  opening,  which  otherwise  gives  no  indication  of  its 
importance.  The  palm-room  is  lined  with  brick,  and  has  an  open  beamed  roof  of  wood.  It 
is  lighted  with  great  round  arched"  windows,  in  the  sjjandrels  of  which  are  superbly  mounted 
heads  of  wild  animals.  It  contains  some  grand  ferns  and  other  decorative  plants.  A  flat  arched 
door,  closed  with  magnificent  gates  of  wrought  iron,  and  on  either  side  of  which  stands  a  column

of  rare  marble  sujiporting  an  antique  statue,  connects  it  with  the  rotunda,  through  which  the 
hall  is  entered  and  the  main  part  of  the  house  is  reached.  This  rotunda  is  a  circular  room, 
beautifulh'  paneled  and  vaulted,  and  lined  throughovit  with  stone.  Cushioned  seats  are  built  in 
below  the  panels,  and  a  Roman  table  stands  in  the  center. 

The  main  hall  is  on  the  north  front  of  the  house,  having  three  large  round  arched  windows 
opening  on  to  the  court.  The  ceiling  is  flat,  with  a  segmental  arch  at  either  end,  one  over  the 
beginning  of  the  stairs,  the  other  before  the  enclosure  at  the  far  end,  and  in  which  stands  the 
fireplace.  It  is  brilliantly  lighted  by  the  great  windows,  which  are  hung  with  silk  curtains,  and 
is  walled  and  floored  with  marble.  A  deep  frieze  is  carried  around  the  upper  walls,  painted  in 
subdued  tones,  and  representing  hunting  scenes  and  foliage  in  the  rectangular  panels,  and  birds 
and  plants  in  the  spandrels  between  the  arches,  which,  in  their  turn,  have  a  broad  border  of 
painted  ornament,  this  happy  mural  decoration  thus  relieving  the  coldness  of  the  marble. 
The  chimneypiece  at  the  farther  end  fills  almost  the  entire  wall,  and  rises  to  the  ceiling. 
Delicately  carved  Doric  columns  support  an  entablature,  beneath  which  is  the  fireplace.  The 
upper  part  contains  a  large  mosaic  within  an  enriched  frame,  and  the  detail  of  the  side  is  delicately 
cut  and  colored.  The  fire-dogs  are  marble  lions  carrying  heraldic  devices,  standing  on  high 
bases.  The  doors  opening  into  the  hall  have  painted  borders  over  the  openings,  and  on  each 
side  stand  marble  columns  supporting  sculptured  animals  or  other  figures.  Busts  are  placed 
on  brackets  between  the  windows.  On  the  platform  at  the  head  of  the  stairs  is  an  open  arch 
overlooking  the  rotunda. 

The  salon  is  the  first  room  on  the  south  front.  It  is  a  magnificent  apartment,  designed 
in  the  style  of  Louis  XV.,  and  is  paneled  throughout  with  wood,  with  a  delicately  ornamented 
cornice  and  decorated  corners  in  the  ceiling.  Paintings  are  let  into  the  walls  above  the  doorways 
and  over  the  built-in  mirrors.  The  fireplace  of  marble  is  exquisitely  enriched  with  gilt  bronze. 
The  windows  are  draped  with  rich  curtains,  and  the  costly  furniture  is  in  keeping  with  the 
architectural  accessories.  A  crystal  chandelier  hangs  from  the  center  of  the  ceiling,  and  beautiful 
gilt  girandoles  are  applied  to  the  panels  of  the  wall. 

The  living-room  adjoins  the  salon  and  occupies  the  center  of  the  south  front,  its  windows 
opening  out  on  to  the  monumental  yjortico.  It  is  in  the  Louis  XIII.  style.  Not  less  elegant 
in  its  furnishings  than  the  salon,  it  only  differs  from  it  in  style,  and  in  being,  as  its  name  signifies, 
the  living-room  of  the  family.  Its  walls  are  paneled  to  the  ceiling,  partly  in  wood  and  partly 
with  superb  pieces  of  damask  silk.  At  either  end  is  a  fireplace,  rich  ])ieces  of  mottled  marble, 
the  overmantel  enclosing  a  full-length  portrait — of  Spanish  royalties — in  a  frame  of  the  same 
material,  beautifully  enriched  with  gilded  bronze.  Over  the  doors  and  the  large  panels  adjoining 
the  fireplaces  are  exquisite  paintings  of  heads  with  seated  putti.  The  furniture  includes  some 
notable  tables  and  cabinets,  and  the  lights  are  girandoles  and  great  vases  standing  in  the  comers 
transfornied  into  candelabra. 

The  dining-room,  in  the  Louis  XV.  stjde,  is  the  last  on  the  south  front,  and  completes 
the  series  of  "state"  apartments.     It  is  entered  from  both  the  hall  and  the  living-room.      Its

walls  are  paneled  in  wood,  enclosing  large  paintings  of  rural  life,  the  cornice  being  supported 
by  pilasters  with  gilded  capitals.  The  fireplace  is  beautifully  detailed,  and  has  a  built-in  mirror 
with  festooned  frame  above  it.  Over  the  doors  are  arched  panels,  with  carved  decoration 
of  foliage.  The  floor,  as  in  the  other  two  great  rooms,  is  almost  completely  covered  with 
a  magnificent  rug. 

Of  the  other  rooms  of  the  house,  it  is  only  necessary  to  refer  to  Mr.  Foster's  own  room, 
which  opens  immediately  from  the  rotunda,  the  doorway  to  which  is  enclosed  within  a  superb 
old  Italian  door  frame  of  carved  wood.  It  is  a  beavitiful  square  apartment,  richly  furnished, 
and  with  an  old  Italian  mantel,  above  which  is  an  old  Italian  mirror  in  a  splendid  frame,  gilded 
and  carved,  and  surrounded  with  paintings  in  medallions. 

The  superb  situation  of  the  house  is  almost  without  parallel.  A  long,  winding  drive  through 
the  forest  brings  one  to  a  turn,  below  which  is  the  magnificent  fountain  to  which  the  place  owes 
its  name.  The  contrast  between  the  thick  woods  and  the  open  house  space  is  quite  startling, 
and  the  effect  is  heightened  by  the  lavish  enrichment  of  the  grounds  and  the  costly  works  of 
art  that  are  used  in  their  decoration.  The  drive  divides  in  two  above  the  head  of  the  fountain, 
and  is  continued  down  on  either  side  to  a  drive  across  the  north  front  of  the  house,  by  which  the 


BELLEFONTAINE"— THE  FOUNTAIN   IN  THE  COURT. 


[201] 


AMERICAN     ESTATES     AND     GARDENS 

stables  and  a  gate  lodge  are  reached  to  the  west,  and  other  parts  of  the  estate  are  approached 
toward  the  east.  Behind  the  fountain  the  drive  is  upheld  by  a  marble  wall,  with  a  retaining 
wall  on  the  farther  side,  beyond  which  is  the  thick  growth  of  forest  trees. 

The  great  fountain  is  placed  at  the  head  of  a  long  pool,  and  is  surrounded  with  a  pergola 
of  twisted  marble  columns,  imported,  like  most  of  the  marble  work,  from  Italy.  It  forms 
a  magnificent  climax  to  the  house  grounds,  and  is  a  structure  of  unusual  beauty.  Beyond  the 
drive  is  the  court  enclosed  on  three  sides  by  the  house.  It  has  an  outer  balustrade,  whose  piers 
support  vases  and  statues  and  contains  many  fine  bay  trees  of  great  size  and  age. 

At  very  few  places  in  America  wih  there  be  found  such  a  combination  of  natural  scenery 
and  primeval  woodland  with  the  most  formal  treatment  of  landscape  effects  imported  from 
France.  As  the  visitor  approaches  the  house  from  the  north  through  the  winding  forest  drive, 
he  is  not  prepared  for  the  sudden  transformation  which  meets  his  eye  when  he  emerges  from 
the  woods  on  to  the  terrace  overlooking  the  long  basin  and  the  north  front  of  the  house.  Here 
everything  is  laid  out  with  a  geometrical  nicety  and  upon  the  most  formal  lines.  The  avenues 
of  poplars  lining  the  straight  drives  which  approach  the  house  from  the  east  and  west,  and 
the  little  formal  gardens  bordering  the  loggias  at  both  ends  of  the  house,  are  French  in  spirit  and 
in  perfect  harmony  with  the  architecture  of  the  mansion.  In  front  of  the  house  is  a  beautifully 
graded  sweep  of  lawn,  and  the  view  of  the  distant  hills  is  not  broken  by  the  presence  of 
a  single  tree,  while  the  natural  forest  at  the  north  side  of  the  house  affords  a  splendid  back- 
ground of  green,  which  sets  out  the  white  walls  of  the  house  to  the  best  advantage.

"Martin  Hall" 

The   House  of  James  K.  Martin,  Esq.,  Great   Neck,  New  York 


SIHE  house  of  Mr.  James  E.  Martin,  at  Great  Neck,   Long  Island,  is  very  beautifully 


H*f  i   placed  on  a  high  cliff  that  rises  abruptly  above  Little  Neck  Bay.      It  is  a  stately 

^1  building  in  black  and  red  brick,  with  white  terra-cotta  trimmings.     The  corners  have 

channeled  pilasters,  and  in  the  center  of  the  entrance  front  is  a  porte-cochere,  two 

stories  in  height,  supported  by  Ionic  columns.     On  the  right  is  a  long  wing  containing  the 

kitchen  and  service  rooms,  and  built  out  on  the  cliff  on  which  the  house  stands,  so  that  on  the 

opposite  side  it  has  a  lower  story  with  a  service  entrance. 

On  the  water-front  the  whole  of  the  first  story  is  arcaded,  except  in  the  center,  with  porches 
within  the  arches;  the  walls  are  supported  by  piers,  with  columns  at  the  entrances.  In  the 
middle  is  a  large  portico,  the  full  height  of  the  house,  with  a  rounded  center.  Arcaded  porches 
are  also  built  at  each  end. 

The  main  entrance  is  by  the  door  under  the  porte-cochere.  It  opens  into  a  vestibule-like 
passage,  which,  however,  is  not  shut  off  from  the  interior;  on  each  side  is  a  passage  leading  to 
a  small  room.  Directly  in  face  is  the  great  central  hall,  which  serves  both  as  living-room  and 
reception-room.     A  short  passage,  with  niches  on  either  side,  connects  the  vestibule  with  it. 

The  hall  is  very  large,  two  stories  in  height,  and  entirely  surrounded  with  a  gallery  sup- 
ported on  arches.  The  stairs  rise  in  pleasant  curves  on  either  side  of  the  entrance  doorway,  and 
form  one  of  the  most  striking  features  of  this  great  room.  It  is  an  apartment  dominated,  in  a 
verv  unusual  degree,  by  the  very  extensive  woodwork  that  enters  into  its  construction.  This  is 
painted  white,  and  the  walls  and  panels  of  the  ceiling  are  red.  Round  columns  support  the 
arches  of  the  lower  story,  which  have  broad  moulded  faces  and  ornamented  keystones  or 
cartouches.  Similar  arches  are  applied  to  the  wall  beneath  the  gallery,  and  the  doors  are 
surmounted  with  broken  curved  pediments.  The  gallery  round  the  upper  floor  has  a  beautiful 
spindle  rail,  with  slightly  projecting  balconies  in  the  center  of  three  sides,  and  channeled 
columns  behind  it,  with  pilasters  on  the  wall,  uphold  the  ceiling.  This  is  arranged  in  panels 
with  moulded  beams  and  a  central  skylight.  A  fireplace  is  at  the  farther  end  on  each  side 
under  the  gallery.  Metal  lamps  hang  from  the  ceiling  in  the  upper  gallery,  which  in  itself  is  an 
upper  room,  beautifulh'  furnished  and  with  many  small  pictures  and  other  decorative  objects 
on  the  walls. 

The  dining-room  is  on  the  right,  and  is  two  steps  lower  down  than  the  great  hall.  The 
woodwork  is  white,  the  walls  yellow.  There  is  a  high  paneled  wainscoting  supporting  curved 
shelves,  on  which  are  placed  many  fine  specimens  of  blue  and  white  porcelain.      The  ceiling

is  paneled,  with  white  beams  and  yellow  centers.  It  opens  on  to  an  enclosed  porch,  lined  with 
brick,  with  an  enclosed  bay  window  beyond  a  triple  archway,  both  portions  forming  a  part  of 
the  series  of  porches  on  the  water-front  of  the  house. 

The  billiard-room  is  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  hall.  The  woodwork  is  once  more  white, 
but  the  walls  are  green,  and  the  ceiling  has  l)ut  three  large  panels,  instead  of  the  many  small 
ones  which  characterize  the  other  rooms.  The  porch  without  looks  on  to  a  small  formal  garden 
in  the  center  of  the  lawn,  containing  a  sun-dial  and  two  large  marble  vases. 

The  house  stands  so  close  to  the  edge  of  the  cliff  that  there  is  no  space  for  a  garden ;  but 
the  broad  steps  of  the  central  portico  descend  on  to  a  green  slope  upheld  b}'  a  wall  supporting 
a  balustrade.  This  is  interrupted  in  the  center  by  steps,  at  the  base  of  which  stand  marble  hons. 
The  terrace  wall  and  balustrade  are  continued  at  right  angles  to  the  end  of  the  dining-room. 
The  water  of  the  bay  is  almost  directly  below,  so  sheer  is  the  cliff  and  so  abrupt  the  descent. 
Quite  in  the  distance  are  the  gray  walls  of  Fort  Schuyler,  across  Long  Island  Sound.

Some  California  Houses 


ERHAPS   no   architecture  is   so  generally   regarded  as   distinctively  American   and 


so  distinctively  modern  as  that  of  the  houses  of  the  Far  West,  and  particularly  those 
^T^f^.,   ^^  California,  which  follow,  as  their  generic  type,  the  old  Spanish  Missions.      To 

the  Eastern  eye,  which  is  very  apt  to  view  buildings  of  every  kind  as  somewhat 
necessarily  modeled  on  European  ideals,  and  more  especially  on  the  ideals  of  England, 
France,  and  Italy,  the  buildings  of  a  frankly  new  type,  which  have  become  quite  prevalent 
in  California  of  late  years,  seem  to  be  thoroughly  characteristic  of  our  warm  Western  lands. 
Their  attraction,  indeed,  is  twofold,  and  consists  not  alone  in  the  unusual  style  of  their  art, 
but  in  the  thoroughly  admirable  way  in  which  they  meet  the  local  climatic  conditions. 

That  many  of  these  buildings  have  charm,  and  quite  distinctive  charm,  is  true.  An 
old  civilization  is  created  afresh  in  their  plastered  walls ;  an  old  life  is  recalled  in  their  spacious 
plans  and  rigid  outlines;  new  ideas,  and  a  new  treatment  of  old  ideas,  here  find  expression 
in  buildings  contemporary  with  ourselves.  The  mystery  of  romance,  the  poetry  of  adventure, 
the  fascination  of  tradition,  are  stmimed  up  and  vitalized  in  these  houses,  which  are  at  once 
so  distinctive  and  so  new.  Their  charm,  however,  is  not  altogether  in  the  novelty  of  the  ideas 
contained  in  their  design.  Yet,  more  than  any  other  group  of  buildings,  they  represent  a  wholly 
new  note  in  our  national  architecture — a  note  that  belongs  entirely  to  them,  since  they 
perpetuate  the  heritage  of  a  different  civilization  from  that  which  obtains  in  the  East,  and 
they  certainly  meet  climatic  and  social  conditions  which  are  peculiarh'  their  own. 


"Hacienda  del  Pozo  de  Verona,"  the  House  of  Mrs.  Phcebe  A.  Hearst. 

The  great  country  seat  of  Mrs.  Phoebe  A.  Hearst,  at  Pleasanton,  California,  to  which 
has  been  given  the  picturesque  name  of  the  "Hacienda  del  Pozo  de  Verona" — the  "House  of 
the  Well  of  Verorta" — is  a  fine  type  of  the  distinctively  Californian  house.  It  is  situated  in 
the  Livermore  Valley,  at  the  entrance  to  Niles  Canon,  not  far  from  San  Francisco  Bay.  And 
here,  on  a  site  commanding  a  magnificent  prospect,  and  surrounded  b}'  thousands  of  acres 
of  vineyards  and  fruit  orchards,  Mrs.  Hearst  has  built  her  country  house,  in  a  style  that  closely 
approximates  a  Mexican  home  of  wealth  and  refinement. 

It  is  a  building  of  vast  size,  with  an  exterior  of  utter  plainness  so  far  as  ornament  is 
concerned,  but  of  considerable  dignity  and  variety  in  its  parts  The  whole  of  the  exterior 
structure  is  covered  with  cement,  and  the  walls,  as  required  by  the  climate,  are  of  great  thick- 
ness.    The  roof  is  covered  with  Spanish  tiles,  and  the  long  water-spouts  project  far  beyond

it  in  Mexican  fashion.  The  plan  is  thoroughly  typical  of  a  great  Mexican  house— a  huge  court- 
yard, on  one  side  of  which  stands  the  dwelling-house,  the  others  being  bounded  by  low  buildings 
necessary  to  the  domestic  economy  of  so  large  a  dwelling.  In  the  center  of  the  courtyard  is 
the  well  head  from  Verona,  from  which  the  name  of  the  house  is  derived.  To  the  right,  as 
one  enters,  are  apartments  for  guests;  to  the  left  are  servants'  quarters,  with  a  servants'  hall 
in  the  comer.  Both  of  these  series  of  rooms  are  continued  on  the  sides  of  the  court,  the 
guests'  rooms  ending  in  a  long  bowling  alley,  the  servants'  rooms  being  separated  from  the 
main  building  by  a  porch.  The  central  structure,  before  which  one  alights  beneath  a  porte- 
cochere,  includes  a  magnificent  hall,  with  a  library  and  music-room  to  the  right,  and 
a  dining-room  to  the  left ;  the  kitchen  is  beyond  a  passage  opening  out  from  the  latter  room ;  the 
corresponding  space  on  the  other  side  is  filled  by  the  biUiard-room.  The  whole  house  is 
splendidly  furnished,  and  contains  many  fine  works  of  art  and  many  household  treasures. 
The  ceilings  throughout  are  beamed. 

The    House   of  Frank    S.  Johnson,  Esq. 

The  house  of  Mr.  Frank  S.  Johnson,  at  San  Rafael,  California,  is  more  modest  in  size 
than  that  of  Mrs.  Hearst,  but  involves  a  number  of  interesting  ideas  in  its  design.  San  Rafael 
is  about  twenty  miles  from  San  Francisco,  of  which  it  is  regarded  as  a  suburb.  It  is  situated 
at  the  foot  of  Mount  Tamalpais,  the  range  of  mountains  enclosing  it  in  amphitheatrical  form. 
Mr.  Johnson's  house  is  placed  on  the  side  of  a  hill,  and  is  a  hundred  and  ten  feet  long  by  thirty- 
five  feet  wide;  it  is  two  stories  in  height,  with  a  basement.  A  double  covered  staircase  gives 
access  to  the  balcony  or  porch,  which  is  overhung  by  the  story  above.  The  floors  are  supported 
by  great  beams,  which  project  from  the  outer  walls  in  the  Spanish  custom.  The  house  is  built 
of  wood  covered  with  cement ;   the  parapets  of  the  roof  are  tiled. 

The  center  of  the  house  is  filled  with  the  reception  hall.  To  the  left  is  the  dining-room, 
with  a  great  fireplace  arranged  in  an  ingle-nook,  with  the  kitchen  and  servants'  quarters  beyond. 
To  the  right  of  the  hall  is  the  library,  with  a  separate  corridor  on  the  entrance  front  that  imme- 
diately connects  the  reception  hall  with  the  living-room,  which  fills  the  entire  right  wing.  The 
upper  floor  is,  of  course,  given  up  to  bedrooms.  Much  taste  has  been  shown  in  the  interior 
fittings;    Cahfornia  redwood  enters  largely  into  the  interior  finish. 

The   Studio   of  Felix    Peano,  Esq. 

x\s  a  final  type  of  California  architecture,  the  studio  built  by  Mr.  Felix  Peano,  the  sculptor, 
for  his  own  use,  at  Oakland,  will  be  found  to  contain  many  points  of  interest.  It  is  finely 
situated  on  a  bluff,  overlooking  Lake  Merritt  on  one  side  and  the  waters  of  the  estuary  on  the 
other.  A  superb  view  of  the  whole  City  of  Oakland  can  be  had  from  the  roof  garden  which 
covers  the  main  building.     The  house  is  built  of  cement,  with  brick  foundations  and  trimmings

of  terra  cotta.  Most  of  the  ornamental  details  are  the  handiwork  of  the  pupils  of  Mr.  Peano, 
who  is  instructor  of  sculpture  in  the  Lick  School  of  Mechanical  Arts  in  San  Francisco.  The 
building  consists  of  two  rooms— a  rece]3tion  hall  and  studio,  the  latter  being  an  apartment  of 
great  size.     There  is  a  separate  office,  and  the  whole  is  surrounded  with  pergolas  and  a  formal

garden.  It  is  a  novel  scheme,  worked  out  in  a  thoroughly  ingenious  way.  When  first  built, 
the  structural  decorations  were  limited  to  the  exterior,  but  it  was  hoped  that,  in  time,  the  pupils 
who  had  added  so  much  to  the  adornment  of  their  master's  house  would  give  further  evidence 
of  their  skill  in  decorating  the  interior.

The  Country   Mansion 


1 

1 

NDER  the  head  of  "Country  Mansions"  may  be  grouped  a  number  of  houses  which 
are  smaller  in  size  than  the  great  palace.  It  would  be  a  mistake  to  imagine  that 
the  largest  houses  are  alone  of  interest.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  their  size  may  be  the 
single  quality  which  attracts  attention  to  them,  and  it  is  quite  possible  for  the  smaller 
house  to  be  more  carefully  designed  and  to  be  a  more  important  work  of  architecture  than 
its  more  pretentious  neighbor.  At  all  events,  it  is  the  lesser  house  which  will  be  the  typical 
country  house  of  the  future;  for  the  palatial  house  must  always  be  the  exceptional  one,  since 
millionaires,  notwithstanding  their  increase,  are  likely  always  to  remain  in  the  minority. 

But  one  does  not  need  to  be  a  millionaire  to  possess  a  beautiful  country  home,  nor  is 
size  an  element  essential  to  the  interest  of  a  country  residence.  The  smaller  house  is  often 
very  charming,  beautifully  designed,  admirably  built,  richly  furnished,  and  thoroughly  com- 
plete in  all  its  appointments  and  surroundings.  Two  or  three  examples  of  houses  of  this  type 
will  make  clear  the  fact  that  the  real  architectural  interest  of  any  house  is  summed  up  in  its 
artistic  qualities.  If  a  house  be  good  and  true  and  beautiful,  the  question  of  its  size — and  of 
its  cost  also,  it  is  well  to  note — is  of  no  moment. 

The    House   of  Price    Collier,  Esq.,  at    Tuxedo,  New  York. 

Mr.  Price  Collier's  house,  at  Tuxedo,  New  York,  is  a  case  in  point.  It  is  charmingly 
placed  on  a  mountain  side,  on  one  of  the  beautiful  sites  for  which  Tuxedo  is  famous.  It  is 
built  of  red  brick  with  white  trimmings.  Its  mass  is  agreeably  broken  into  projections  and 
wings  which  have  a  definite  relationship  to  the  plan,  and  the  high  pointed  roof  is  a  dignified 
crowning  member,  that  has  been  treated  in  a  masterly  way.  If  the  front  of  the  house  be  that 
at  which  a  guest  descends  from  his  carriage,  then,  paradoxical  as  it  may  seem,  the  front  of  this 
house  is  at  the  back.  The  plan,  in  truth,  is  exceedingly  clever;  for  the  house,  standing  on 
a  hillside,  required  that  the  main  porch  should  overlook  the  valley  by  which  it  is  approached. 
To  make  this  porch  the  entrance  porch  would  have  destroyed  its  privacy.  The  porte-cochere, 
therefore,  is  carried  to  the  other  side,  where  it  is  built  before  the  door  by  which  the  house  is 
usually  entered. 

Here  is  the  entrance  hall,  with  the  stairs  to  the  upper  floor.  Large  folding  doors  admit 
one  to  a  larger  hall  which  opens  directly  on  to  the  main  porch  overlooking  the  valley.  On  one 
side  are  the  drawing-room  and  study,  the  latter  entered  from  the  entrance  hall;  on  the  other  is 
the  dining-room,  with  a  nursery  behind,  and  a  passage  connecting  with  the  kitchen,  pantry, 
and  servants'  hall,  all  of  which  are  placed  in  the  farther  wing,  quite  separated  from  the  Hving 
portions  of  the  house.

AMERICAN     ESTATES     AND     GARDENS 

The  interior  is  designed  throughout  in  the  Colonial  style,  very  carefully  studied  and 
treated  with  fine  simplicity  of  detail.  The  structural  decorations  are  limited  to  the  door  and 
window  frames  and  the  carefully  modeled  cornices.  In  the  dining-room  and  drawing-room 
the  window  frames  are  embellished  with  pilasters,  and  the  mantelpieces,  while  simply  designed, 
are  admirable  illustrations  of  modern  Colonial  workmanship. 

The  House  of  Matthew  Baird,  Esq.,  at  Ardmore,  Pennsylvania. 

Mr.  Matthew  Baird's  house,  at  Ardmore,  Pennsylvania,  is  a  good  example  of  the  half- 
timl^er  style  that  enjoj^s  a  well-deserved  popularity  for  cotmtry  houses.  It  stands  in  one  of 
the  lovely  suburbs  for  which  Philadelphia  is  famous.  The  lower  story  is  of  granite,  the  upper 
of  half-timber  work,  the  heavy  timbers  being  filled  in  with  stucco,  the  pebbles  retaining  their 
natural  whitish  hue.  Stone  reappears  in  the  chimneys,  and  a  brilliant  note  of  color  is  given 
by  the  terra-cotta  pots  with  which  they  are  topped. 

It  is  a  large  house,  with  a  kitchen  and  laundry  occupying  a  wing  to  the  rear  on  the  right. 
The  hall,  which  contains  the  stairs,  occupies  the  entire  center  of  the  house,  with  windows  front 
and  back.  The  entrance  is  through  a  vestibule  in  the  front;  the  adjoining  space  in  the  hall  is 
finished  as  an  ingle-nook,  with  a  large  mantelpiece  between  the  two  windows.  The  walls  are 
wainscoted  throughout,  and  the  ceiling  beamed.  A  winding  stair  in  a  bay  window  at  the 
back  leads  to  the  grille-room  in  the  basement.  To  the  left  of  the  hall  are  the  reception-room 
and  library,  separated  from  each  other  by  an  arched  doorway.  Both  have  a  paneled  wainscot 
about  four  feet  in  height ;  the  reception-room  has  a  geometric  ceiling  of  plaster,  and  the  library 
built-in  bookcases.  Immediately  adjoining  the  hall  to  the  right  is  the  tea-room,  a  dainty  little 
apartment  finished  in  white.  The  dining-room,  which  adjoins,  occupies  the  remainder  of  the 
front,  and  has  windows  on  the  front  and  side.  Behind  it  is  the  morning-room,  with  a  large 
bay  window,  and  separated  from  the  pantry,  which  connects  with  the  kitchen  by  a  special 
hall.     Both  are  finished  in  dark  Flemish  oak. 

The  House  of  Mrs.  Charles  F.  Coffin,  at  Montclair,  New  Jersey. 

Mrs.  Charles  F.  Coffin's  house,  at  Montclair,  New  Jersey,  is  another  interesting  example 
of  half-timber  work.  Located  at  the  foot  of  the  Orange  Mountains,  crescent-shaped  terraces 
of  field  stones  and  large  forest  trees  form  a  striking  foreground.  From  the  covered  gateway 
a  winding  path  leads  to  the  several  flights  of  stone  steps  that  give  access  to  the  main 
entrance. 

The  main  part  of  the  first  story  is  built  of  red  brick.  The  remainder  of  the  building  is 
in  half -timber  work,  with  the  stucco  tinted  a  rich  buff.  The  roof  shingles  are  bright  red.  The 
plan  is  pre-eminently  spacious  in  its  arrangement.  The  hall  is  octagonal,  with  a  vaulted  ceil- 
ing.     The  eight  openings  are  finished  with  flat  Tudor  arches.      It  is  partly  wainscoted,  the

upper  walls  being  sand  finished  and  stippled  a  dull  gold  on  an  tmderlying  brownish  tone.  In 
the  apex  of  the  dome  is  placed  an  electric  disk  light.  On  either  side  of  the  front  door  is  a  low 
closet,  with  fret-sawn  panels  in  the  doors  and  top:  one  serves  as  a  screen  for  the  radiator,  and 
the  other  as  a  coat  closet.  Above  these  closets  are  high  windows,  glazed  with  opalescent 
rondels . 

The  reception-room  is  back  of  the  hall,  and  separated  from  the  stairs  by  an  ornamental 
screen,  into  which  Moorish  tiles  are  inserted.  A  half-timber  effect  is  introduced  on  the  stairs 
and  in  the  reception-room  by  filling  the  lower  panels  with  tapestry.  The  ceiling  is  in  dull 
gold. 

The  dining-room  is  to  the  right  of  the  hall,  and  like  the  reception-room  and  hall  is 
trimmed  with  quartered  white  oak,  stained  a  dark  brown.  Above  a  low  base  are  panels  in 
oak,  filled  in  with  burlap  studded  with  nails.  The  walls  above  are  covered  with  burlap,  deco- 
rated with  a  grape  design.  The  panels  of  the  ceiling  are  light  brown.  Beyond  is  the  kitchen, 
partly  occupying  a  wing  beyond  the  main  building.  The  living-room  is  on  the  opposite  side 
of  the  hall.  The  woodwork  is  stained  a  dark  green.  There  is  a  heavy  beam  ceiling,  and  the 
walls  are  covered  with  burlap  of  a  gray-green  tone.  The  plaster  panels  of  the  ceiling  are  also 
tinted  green.  The  facing  of  the  fireplace  is  green  and  blue  glass  mosaic,  with  touches  of  purple; 
above  it  is  a  picture  built  in,  and  specially  painted  to  harmonize  with  the  colors  of  the  mantel.

"Mill-Brook,"    the    House   of   F.    King   Wainwright,    Esq., 

at    Bryn    Mawr,   Pennsylvania. 

"Mill-Brook,"  Mr.  F.  King  Wainwright's  house,  at  Bryn  Mawr,  Pennsylvania,  is  built 
on  one  of  the  green  hillsides  which  abound  in  the  environs  of  Philadelphia.     The  site  is  sunny, 
but  the  house  is  a  quite  poetic  conception,  very  admirably  carried  out.     Local  field  stone  forms 
the  fabric  of  the  first  story;    above,  the  walls  are  in  half -timber  work,  the  plaster  remaining 
in  its  natural  soft  gray  color.     The  shingled  roof  is  stained  a  dark  moss  green.      A  round 
archway,  under  a  simple  shed-like  roof,  serves  as  the  entrance.     It  opens  from  an  open  court, 
formed     by     the      main 
building     and     by      the 
kitchen  wing  which  pro- 
jects    at     right      angles 
from     it.       The     quaint 
chimney  of  the  latter  is 
quite  a  marked  feature. 
The    plan    is    some- 
what irregular,   although 
not    at    all    wanting    in 
convenience  nor  in  logi- 
cal     arrangement.       The 
entrance    doorway   leads 
directly    into     a     lobby, 
from   which    the    hall    is 
entered  from  one  corner. 
This    picturesque    apart- 
ment    is     paneled     with 
wood,     stained     a      soft 
brown,   to  the  height  of 
seven  feet.      The  ceiling 
is    beamed.       The    stairs 
are  on  the  entrance  side 
dividing    ]jart    way    up. 
To  the  left  is  the  library 
or      living-room,      which 
fills  the  entire  end  of  the 
house  and  opens  directly 
on    to    the    end    porch, 
which     is     overbuilt     by  «« MILL-BROOK"— THE  TERRACE  PORCH.

the  second  story,  upheld  in  the  center  by  a  huge  swelled  column.  The  room  has  a  battened 
wainscoting  and  a  beamed  ceiling,  and  an  ingle-nook,  with  fireplace  and  built-in  seats,  paved 
with  reddish  tiles. 

The  dining-room  is  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  hall,  the  front  space  being  filled  with 
a  conservatory.  The  battened  wainscoting  rises  to  a  high  plate  rack.  China  closets  are 
built  into  two  of  the  corners,  and  the  mantelpiece  has  facings  of  Welsh  tiles.  The  space 
between  the  dining-room  and  the  lil^rary  on  the  front  of  the  house  is  partly  filled  with  the 
reception-room,  which  is  beautifully  finished  in  white,  and  a  charming  little  porch,  which  gives 
access  to  the  hillside  immediately  below. 

"Chateau  Rexsamer,"  the  House  of  Mrs.  George  W.  Rexsamer, 

at  Elizabethtown,  New  York. 

"Chateau  Rexsamer,"  at  EHzabethtown,  New  York,  is  a  house  of  quite  unique  interest. 
It  is  built  on  a  steep  mountain  side  in  the  Adirondack  Mountains,  on  a  site  so  irregular 
that  only  an  unusual  plan  and  an 
unusual  construction  were  possible. 
The  site  conditions  were  so  diffi- 
cult that  no  stairs  are  inside  the 
main  building;  the  living-room  is 
above  the  guest  chambers,  and 
the  dining-room  is  above  the 
kitchen  and  ice-house.  The  house, 
which  is  btiilt  of  stone  with  a 
stucco  superstructtire,  is  in  two 
parts,  connected  with  an  open 
stairway.  The  floor  upon  which 
the  living-room  and  two  owner's 
bedrooms  are  situated  is  level 
with  the  ground  at  the  rear  of 
the  house.  The  mountain,  in  fact, 
rises  so  precipitously  from  the 
walls  of  the  building  that  the 
only  view  of  the  sky  from  this 
portion  is  through  the  dormers 
of  the  roof.  On  this  floor  the 
famil}^  live,  and  from  the  open 
parts  of  its  surrounding  porch  in 
clear  weather  they  can  enjoy  the  "CHATEAU  REXSAMER.

view    of   the    entire    valley   below; 
in     the     stormy    season     a    porch 
enclosed  with  glass  must  be  used. 
The  ground  falls  away  too  rapidly 
for  the  dining-room  to  be  on  the 
same    level    with    the    living-room. 
It    was    desirable    to    reduce    the 
number  of  steps  between  the  two 
rooms  to  a  minimum,    and   hence 
the  placing  of  these  rooms  in  the 
second  story  of  that  building.     The 
ice-house  is  so  perfecth'  insulated 
that  its  position  is  not  disadvan- 
tageous,   and    no    portion    of    the 
servants'  rooms  is  below  the  level 
of  the  ground.     The  guest   cham- 
bers, although  on  the  ground  floor, 
are  so  elevated  that  their  windows, 
from  which  beautiful  views  can  be 
had,     are    twelve  feet    above    the 
ground.     The  servants'  jjorch  opens 
from    the    kitchen,    and    is    appar- 
ently not  shut  in;    but,  as  the  rail- 
ing is  of  stucco  instead  of  open,  and

as    the    adjoming   trees    spread    heavy    foliage   toward    it,    its    seclusion    is    sufficient   to   give 
that  ])rivacy  which  is  necessary  at  the  kitchen  end  of  a  house. 

The  Chateau  is  a  summer  residence,  and  although  there  are  large  fireplaces  in  all  the  large 
rooms,  making  May  and  October  the  most  cheery  months  of  the  ^-ear,  vet  it  is  in  the  hot 
season  that  the  house  is  principally  used.  Under  these  conditions  it  is  no  drawback  to  reach 
the  guest  chambers  by  wa)^  of  the  covered  passage  and  the  terrace,  and  the  shed,  open  on  all 
sides,  but  protected  by  a  high  retaining-wall,  is  a  more  comfortable  place  for  the  laundress  to 
work  in  than  a  room  inside  would  be. 

The  House  of  John  G.  Wright,  Esq.,  at  Brookline,  Massachusetts. 

Mr.  John  G.  Wright's  house,  at  Brookline,  Massachusetts,  is  a  fine  type  of  the  countr^■ 
house  of  which  the  suburbs  of  Boston  offer  so  many  examples.  It  is  built  of  buff  brick,  and 
is  finished  with  a  slate  roof.  If  its  st}-le  should  be  named,  it  would  unquestionabh-  be  called 
a  late  version  of  English  domestic  Gothic;    but  it  is  a  thoroughly  modern  house,  perfectly

adapted  td  the  exigencies  of  modern  life.  The  entrance  front  is  quite  irregular,  with  a  great 
square  tower  for  the  stairs,  and  a  projecting  wing  with  a  bay  window  for  the  bilhard-room. 
A  stone  porch,  battlemented  hke  a  tower,  is  prefixed  to  the  entrance  doorway.  The  ter- 
race front  is  more  regular,  with  two  gabled  wings  projecting  from  either  end  of  the  center, 
each  treated  alike  with  rectangular  bay  windows  in  the  first  story,  and  plainly  finished,  but 
not  the  less  pleasing,  gables  in  the  third  story. 

The  interior  is  thoroughly  harmonious  and  admirably  planned.  A  vestibule  leads 
directly  to  the  hall,  which  occupies  the  entire  center  of  the  house.  The  stairs  are 
immediately  to  the  right,  within  their  own  tower,  but  forming  a  part  of  the  hall  furnishings. 
The  hall  itself  has  a  paneled  wainscoting  and  a  beamed  ceiling,  the  panels  of  which  are  deco- 
rated with  rich  geometric  design.  To  the  left  is  the  reception-room,  finished  in  the  Louis  XV. 
style.  The  living-room,  which  is  also  entered  from  the  hall,  adjoins  it,  and  occupies  one  of 
the  wings  overlooking  the  terrace.  The  woodwork  is  painted  white,  the  walls  marked  off  with 
pilasters,  with  built-in  bookcases. 

In  the  corresponding  position  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  hall  is  the  dining-room.  It 
has  a  paneled  wainscoting  in  quartered  oak.  The  bay  window  on  the  terrace  front  serves 
as  a  conservatory.  The  butler's  pantry  and  a  passage,  the  latter  connecting  with  an  alcove 
opening  into  the  hall,  connect  the  dining-room  with  the  kitchen,  which,  with  its  allied  rooms, 
fills  an  outer  wing.  The  billiard-room,  which  completes  the^list  of  apartments  on  the  ground 
floor,  is  finished  with  mahogany.  It  has  a  paneled  wainscoting  and  a  beamed  ceiling.  With 
the  exception  of  the  kitchen  wing,  the  whole  house,  beginning  with  the  entrance  porch  and 
continued  around  to  the  opposite  side,  is  surrounded  with  a  terrace,  built  of  stone  and  enclosed 
within  a  balustrade.  It  is  a  fine  and  effective  feature,  quite  in  keeping  with  the  architecture 
of  the  building,  and  is  the  most  striking  external  element  of  the  house,  adding  greatly  to  the 
dignity  of  its  appearance. 

"Ashford,"  the  House  of  Frank  Squier,  Esq.,  at  Belle  Haven, 

Greenwich,  Connecticut. 

The  beautiful  house  of  Mr.  Frank  Squier,  at  Belle  Haven,  Greenwich,  Connecticut,  is 
a  charming  and  poetic  design  by  Mr.  Wilson  Evre,  Jr.  It  is  placed  on  the  crest  of  a  knoll  in 
rolling  country,  well  wooded.  It  is  a  fine  stud}-  in  Colonial  architecture  adapted  to  modem 
uses,  a  building  permeated,  indeed,  with  tvixe  Colonial  feeling,  very  beautifully  detailed,  very 
simple  and  direct  in  its  composition,  liut  quite  modern  also,  good  to  look  upon,  and  thoroughly 
comfortable  and  delightful  to  live  in.  It  is  a  long  rectangle  in  plan,  with  a  kitchen  wing  that 
continues  the  main  axis.  It  is  built  of  wood,  painted  white,  with  blue -green  shutters — a  simple 
color  scheme  of  unsurpassed  merit.  The  longer  fronts  face  the  north  and  the  south,  and  each 
gives  upon  so  pleasant  a  prospect  that  the  terms  "garden  front"  and  "entrance  front"  are 
ignored  in  the  nomenclature  of  the  house.

AMERICAN     ESTATES     AND     GARDENS 


The  carriage  entrance  is  on  the 
north.  Here  is  a  great  square  pergola, 
a  stately  arbor  with  Doric  columns  and 
low  rounded  archways  in  the  center  of 
two  sides — the  house  forming  the  fourth 
side — for  the  driveways,  which  in  the 
central  space  are  bounded  by  octagonal 
lines  enclosing  a  circle  on  which  stands 
a  sun  dial.  The  pergola  is  now  well 
covered  with  vines,  but  it  has  quite 
tinusual  stateliness  of  design.  Its  base 
is  entirely  surrounded  with  a  thick- 
growing  hedge  of  privet.  The  entrance 
porch  to  the  house  is  small  and  low, 
"ASHFORD"— GARDEN  STEPS.  two  Doric  cokimns  stipporting  a  finely 

modeled  entablature  and  pediment.  Built-in  seats  on  either  side  are  suggestive  of  pleasant 
hospitality.  The  other  parts  of  the  front  are  thoroughly  restrained,  the  windows  plainly  set 
in  simple  frames,  so  that  the  severe  cornice  is  the  chief  relief  of  the  upper  wall.  There  are 
four  dormers  in  the  pointed  roof,  the  outer  ones  with  two  windows,  the  central  pair  with  one. 
The  severity  of  this  front,  therefore,  heightens  the  effect  of  the  splendid  pergola  in  a  thoroughly 

legitimate  way. 

The  elements  in  the  design  of  the  south  front  are  very  similar,  although  the  treatment 
is  essentially  different.  Two  great  pedimented  porticoes  project  from  the  ends  of  this  front, 
each  with  four  Doric  columns  on  the  front  and  two  on  the  sides— porticoes  quite  grandiose  in 
scale,  and  yet  very  thoroughly 
harmonized  with  the  building 
to  which  they  are  attached. 
A  trellised  jjorch  or  pergola 
connects  them  just  before  the 
house,  which,  above  the  center, 
swells  into  a  bay  window.  In 
the  center  of  the  garden  space 
between  the  porticoes  is  a 
delicious  fountain,  l)y  Frederick 
Macmonnies. 

The  general  character  of 
the  interior  is  dominated  b}' 
a  true  Colonial  feeling  without 
any   regard   for   archaic   effect.

The  center  is  filled  with  a  hall,  reaching  from  front  to  front.  The  walls,  which  have  a  white 
paneled  wainscoting  finished  with  a  mahogan)  cap,  are  covered  with  light  buff  burla])  and 
support  a  beamed  ceiling.  The  stairs  are  contained  in  a  separate  hall,  which  opens  directly 
from  the  main  hall  to  the  left  of  the  north  doorway.  Directly  opposite  is  the  studio — 
Mr.  Squier's  own  room — a  delightful  apartment,  finished  in  maroon,  with  a  bay  window. 
It  opens  directly  on  to  a  covered  ])orch,  which  is  enclosed  within  the  walls  of  the  house. 
On  the  south  front  the  spaces  on  either  side  of  the  hall  are  filled  with  two  great  rooms — 
the  drawing-room  on  the  right,  the  dining-room  on  the  left.  Both  have  paneled  wainscots 
in  white,  and  walls  hung  with  silk  of  greenish  hue. 

The  House  of  George  S.  Graham,  Esq.,  at  Bryn  Mawr,  Pennsylvania. 

The  house  of  Mr.  George  S.  Graham,  at  Bryn  Mawr,  Pennsylvania,  is  a  splendid  type  of 
the  large  brick  country  house.  It  is  a  thoroughly  brick  building,  deep  dark  red  in  color,  in 
which  stone  is  used  for  the  trimming  in  so  suppressed  a  manner  as  to  in  no  way  affect  the 
identity  of  the  brick  construction.  The  Indiana  limestone  which  has  been  chosen  as  the 
co-ordinate  material  appears  only  in  the  frame  of  the  main  doorway — and  a  charming  bit  of 
stonework  it  is,  too,  beautifully  designed  and  exquisitely  carved — and  on  the  window  frames, 
and  the  summits  of  the  btittresses,  and  the  capitals  of  the  piers  which  uphold  the  brick  arches 
on  which  much  of  the  upper  story  is  carried. 

The  house  is  very  large,  with  a  delightful  silhouette  due  to  its  varied  outhne,  the  scale 
being  so  great  that  almost  every  room,  certainly  the  chief  rooms  on  the  ground  floor,  occupies 
a  wing  of  its  own.  It  was  a  task  of  no  small  difficulty  to  harmonize  such  a  plan  into  a  single 
homogeneous  building,  but  the  picturesque  results  fully  justif}'  the  great  expenditure  this 
system  entailed.  A  very  distinctive  feature  of  the  exterior  is  the  brick  porches,  supported  on 
piers  carrying  round  arches  and  strengthened  with  corner  buttresses.  The  second  story  is 
built  out  flush  over  these  arches,  which  have  an  impi-ession  of  strength  quite  unusual  in  resi- 
dential buildings.  The  house,  it  should  be  added,  stands  on  the  summit  of  a  hill,  and  is 
a  conspicuous  landmark  in  its  vicinity. 

Notwithstanding  the  great  size  of  the  ground  area,  the  plan  is  very  direct  and  simple. 
The  hall  is  vaulted,  rectangular  in  plan,  and  extends  straight  through  the  house  from  the  stone 
doorway  to  the  porte-cochere  on  the  other  front,  which  is  reached  through  a  vestibule,  vaulted 
like  the  hall.  It  is  finished  in  oak,  with  a  high  wainscot  and  pilasters  to  carry  the  vault.  The 
stairway  immediately  adjoins  the  stone  doorway,  and  is  placed  in  a  bay  window,  which  forms 
a  turret  attached  to  the  doorway  tower.  A  passage  at  right  angles  to  the  hall  opens  on  to  the 
reception-room  on  the  right,  and  leads  to  the  dining-room  immediately  in  face.  The  recej)- 
tion-room  is  white,  the  dining-room  dark  oak.  The  latter  has  a  paneled  wainscoting  and 
a  beamed  ceiling.     The  adjoining  wing  is  given  up  to  the  kitchen  and  its  dependencies. 

On  the  farther  side  of  the  hall  is  the  library,  which  fills  the  entire  space  from  outer  wall  to 
outer  wall.     It  is  sunk  two  feet  below  the  level  of  the  hall  that  a  greater  height  may  be  obtained.

It  is  handsomely  finished  in  dark  quartered  oak,  with  a  high  paneled  wainscoting  and 
a  heavily  beamed  ceiling.  The  open  fireplace  is  faced  with  Indiana  limestone,  and  the  walls  are 
lined  with  built-in  bookcases.  A  billiard-room  is  beyond,  occupying  a  special  wing  projected 
on  the  back  of  the  house,  whose  great  brick  chimney,  directly  on  the  end,  is  a  striking  feature 
of  the  exterior.  It  is  a  Gothic  room,  with  an  open  timber  roof — a  splendid  room,  handsomely 
furnished,  and  admirably  adapted  to  its  purpose.

Craigston,"  the  House  ot  T.  C.  Hollander,  Esq.,  Wenham,  Massachusetts 


A  ]:)leasant  drive  through  a  hilly  cotmtr}'  and  past  many  fine  estates  forms  the 
approach  to  Mr.  T.  C.  Hollander's  house,  at  Wenham,  Massachusetts.  It  is  placed  on  the 
summit  of  a  high  hill,  which  afl:ords  magnificent  outlooks  for  many  miles  around.  Wonderful 
views,  indeed,  can  be  had  from  every  part  of  this  house,  each  hilltop  bearing  a  notable 
estate,  or  a  rare  old  farmhouse,  whose  picturesque  qualities  have  been  heightened  with 
age.  Most  of  the  land  immediately  around  Mr.  Hollander's  house  has  been  left  in  its 
natural    state,    uncultivated,    so    far    as    modern    art    might    change    it,    but    still    bearing

a  plentiful  foliage  of  native  grass  and  wild  flowers.  A  spaciovts  terrace  has  been  cleared 
before  the  house,  and  beautifully  planted  with  shrubs  and  flowers— a  true  garden  spot,  set 
among  wild  surroundings. 

The  house  is  a  long,  low,  ramljling  structure,  rough-cast,  with  exposed  timbers;  very 
varied  as  to  heights  and  roofs,  quite  unsymmetrical  in  the  disposition  of  its  parts,  yet  full  of 
a  character  and  charm  that  pervades  and  harmonizes  the  whole  and  renders  it  a  very  interesting 
bit  of  design.  It  is,  in  point  of  fact,  a  group  of  buildings,  homogeneously  joined  together  in 
a  single  stmcture,  each  part  with  a  distinct  purpose  and  an  individual  form.  The  residence 
portion  of  the  house  occupies  the  center  of  the  group.  It  is  two  stories  in  height,  with  two 
bay  windows  as  its  leading  feature,  and  a  high  pointed  roof,  with  a  gable  surmounting  one  bay 
window,  and  a  dormer  the  other.  To  the  left  is  the  music-room,  which  has  a  wing  to  itself, 
and  on  the  right  are  the  servants'  quarters,  with  the  stable  on  the  far  end.  The  entrance  front, 
therefore,  is  composed  of  various  elements,  each  with  its  own  particular  use— and  to  this  fact 
it  owes  its  wide  extent  and  undeniable  interest. 

The  house  is  entered  through  the  great  hall,  which  fills  the  center  from  front  to  front, 
and  opens  at  the  farther  end  on  to  the  terrace  at  the  back.     It  has  a  beamed  ceihng  and  a  paneled

wainscoting.  The  woodwork  is  painted  white,  and  the  mantel,  of  l)rick,  is  of  Colonial  design. 
On  the  right  is  a  smaller  hall,  containing  the  stairs,  which  is  paneled  throughout  with  French 
walnut,  with  built-in  bookcases.  This  pleasant,  cheerful  little  room  serves  also  as  the  library 
of  the  house. 

Behind  it  is  the  diiiing-room,  with  a  spreading  bay  window  at  the  farther  end.  The 
woodwork,  which  includes  a  paneled  wainscoting,  is  painted  white.  The  chimneyjjiece  is 
built  diagonally  across  one  corner,  and  has  a  paneled  overmantel;  in  the  corresponding  corner 
is  a  built-in  china  closet.  The  walls  above  the  wainscot  are  blue,  and  blue  curtains  and 
a  blue  i"ug  complete  the  color  scheme. 

On  the  opposite  side  of  the  hall,  the  front  of  the  house  has  a  beautiful  little  reception-room 
or  sun-parlor,  brilliantly  lighted  with  windows,  which  fill  much  of  its  outer  walls.     Behind

it  is  the  billiard-room,  which  is  finished  in  oak.  The  paneled  wainscoting  is  tinted  a  very  dark 
green;  the  walls  above  are  painted  in  a  green-and-white  lattice  design.  There  is  a  brick 
fireplace,  and  the  sash  curtains  are  of  green  silk. 

The  music-room  is  beyond,  and  fills  a  wing  of  its  own.  It  is  a  large  room,  especially  built 
for  the  immense  pipe  organ  which  is  its  principal  contents.  The  open  beamed  roof  is  in  oak, 
as  IS  the  rest  of  the  woodwork.  There  is  a  high  paneled  wainscot  :  the  upper  walls  are  left 
in  rough  plaster  of  a  yellow  tint.     The  fireplace  is  of  Caen  stone,  and  the  windows  of  leaded  glass. 

The  grounds  around  the  house  are  well  equipped  for  outdoor  sports.  There  are  tennis 
courts,  tracks  for  hurdle  racing,  and  other  provisions  for  delighting  the  sportsman  and  providing 
for  his  entertainment. 


"Talbot    House,"   the    House    of   Talbot  J.   Taylor,   Esq., 

Cedarhurst,   New    York. 

Mr.  Taylor's  house  is  a  rambling  structure,  pleasantly  environed  in  the  agreeable 
landscape  for  which  Cedarhurst  and  the  near-by  places  are  famed.  It  is  built  partly  in 
brick  and  partly  in  half-timber  work.  The  irregular  plan  lends  itself  very  happily  to  the 
tmibered  gables,  many  dormers,  and  fine  chimney  stacks,  which  constitute  the  external 
features.  The  house  was  not,  indeed,  built  all  at  one  time.  The  oldest  wing,  closely 
covered  with  ivy,  is  now  apportioned  to  the  service;  but  the  new  parts  have  been  so 
happily  harmonized  with  each  other  and  with  the  older  structure  that  the  house  is,  in 
a  very  complete  sense,  a  thorovighly  harmonized  composition.  This  is  the  more  note- 
worthy since  the  external  architectural  expression  is  decidedly  irregular  and  varied.  The 
larger  part  of  the  main  building  is  two  stories  in  height,  with  a  sloping  roof.  The  general  plan 
consists  of  a  main  part,  containing  the  entrance  hall  and  the  drawing-room,  with  two  forked 
branches  running  out  at  different  angles,  the  larger  one  of  which  abuts  against  a  pavilion  con- 
taming  the  library.  The  picturesque  architecture  of  the  half-timbered  upper  story,  the  high 
pitched  roofs,  and  the  gay  and  ingeniously  varied  dormers  are  delightful  expressions  of  this 
irregular  ground  plan. 

The  house  is  entered  through  a  glazed  and  latticed  porch,  thickly  overgrown  with  ivy. 
The  hall  is  paneled  in  oak,  very  darkly  stained,  square,  plain  panels,  without  ornament  and 
without  cornice,  rising  directly  to  the  plaster  ceiling,  which  is  decorated  with  an  elaborate 
geometrical  design,  the  patterns  otitlined  in  moulded  ornament  decorated  with  scrolls  and 
foliage.  The  staircase  rises  immediately  to  the  right  of  the  entrance  door,  and  is  continued 
above  it,  the  level  here  being  a  few  steps  below  that  of  the  main  floor.  On  one  side  is  the  fire- 
place, the  stone  facing  of  which  supports  a  simple  shelf.  Flanking  the  fireplace  stand  two 
great  bronze  candelabra.      The  hall  contains  some  handsomely  carved  oak  chests,  and  rich

tables  and  chairs  com])lete  its  furnishings.      A  beautiful  rug  is  laid   on   the  center  of   the 
dark -stained  floor. 

To  the  right  is  the  drawing-room,  paneled  in  wood  like  the  hall ;  but  the  design  is  dis- 
tincth-  richer,  and  the  upper  panels  above  a  moulding,  form  a  frieze  of  small  squares,  each 
beautifully  carved.  The  ceiling  is  beamed,  with  plain  white  panels.  The  fireplace  is  a  simple 
Tudor  arch  cut  in  the  stone  facing;  the  arch  is  surmounted  by  a  slender  shelf  carried  on  car\-ed 
supports,  and  with  panels  formed  below  it.  Immediately  opposite  the  entrance  door  is  a  large 
bay  window,  almost  completely  glazed  and  opening  on  to  the  end  porch,  by  which  it  is  com- 
pletely surrounded.  On  either  side  of  this  opening,  and  on  either  side  of  the  doorway,  are  fine 
old  lantern  standards.  The  draperies  are  rich  red  velvet;  the  furniture  is  old  gold  covered 
with  tapestry;   and  on  one  side  is  a  superb  open  cabinet,  elaborately  carved. 

Directly  opposite  the  main  doorway,  in  the  hall,  is  a  door  that  leads  to  an  enclosed  porch 
or  sun-parlor.  The  door  by  which  it  is  entered  opens  on  to  a  balcony  or  gallery,  for  the  main 
floor  is  some  steps  lower  down  and  is  paved  with  brick.  Fine  palms  and  other  plants  are 
placed  here,  and  in  one  corner  is  a  fountain.  Farther  on,  in  the  hall,  the  corner  forms  a  passage, 
by  which  the  dining-room  and  farther  parts  of  the  house  are  entered.  The  plan  changes  its 
direction  here,  affording  charming  vistas  of  farther  rooms  so  devised  that  only  small  parts 
can  be  seen— an  arrangement  that  is  delightfully  suggestive  of  mystery  and  extent.  From  this 
corner  the  service  quarters  branch  off  to  the  left,  while  t,he  other  main  rooms  are  continued 
on  the  right.  The  service  quarters  are  quite  extensive,  with  pantries,  kitchen,  and  .servants' 
-  dining-room  on  the  main  floor,  laundry  below,  and  sleeping-room  above. 

The  dining-room  is  distinctly  gallery -like  in  plan,  with  two  sides  brilliantly  lighted  by 
wide  groups  of  muUioned  windows.  The  walls,  almost  white  in  color,  are  plastered,  with  slender, 
strip-like  wood  pilasters  m  the  comers,  angles,  and  other  points  of  emphasis.  The  pilasters 
carry  a  narrow  strip  of  wood,  which  serves  as  the  cornice.  The  white  ceiling  is  di^•ided  into 
great  oblong  panels  by  heavy  beams,  covered  with  a  richly  plastered  decoration.  The  gen- 
erous fireplace  has  a  rare  old  frontispiece,  richly  car^'ed  in  stone.  The  floor  is  laid  in  large 
blocks  of  black  and  white  marble,  and  the  curtains,  which  are  partly  spread  upon  the  floor, 
are  in  beautiful  dark  mauve  damask.  The  same  material  is  used  in  the  chair  coverings,  the 
heavily  carved  chairs  and  dining  table  being  of  quite  unusual  beauty.  The  sideboard,  oppo- 
site the  fireplace,  is  also  beautifully  carved.  The  doors  on  the  two  ends  of  the  room  are  glazed 
m  small  squares.     The  radiators  are  placed  within  a  wainscoted  screen  beneath  the  windows. 

Beyond  the  dining-room  is  the  superb  library,  which  is  of  truly  magnificent  dimen- 
sions. It  is  the  largest,  the  sunniest,  the  most  cheerful  room  in  the  house,  and  the  most  inter- 
esting both  in  its  decorations  and  in  its  situation.  The  doors  from  the  dining-room  open  on 
to  a  balcony,  below  which  is  the  library.  The  room  is  so  very  large  that,  without  the  increased 
height  given  by  this  unusual  arrangement,  it  would  have  been  too  low.  But  the  balcony  is 
at  once  its  most  important  and  ornamental  feature.  It  is  a  broad  passage,  enclosed  within  piers 
and  arches,  with  a  pierced  balustrade  of  intricate  design.     On  the  outer  face  the   piers    are

ornamented  with  gaines.  To  the  left  is  a  staircase  to  the  upper  floor.  The  dehcate  Tudor 
arches  of  the  arcade  are  repeated  as  a  wall  pattern  on  the  entrance  wall,  and  the  ceiling  design- 
large  sciuares  containing  circles— is  identical  with  that  of  the  rest  of  the  room. 

The  great  fireplace,  like  most  of  those  in  the  house,  is  of  quite  rigid  simplicity;  luit  above 
it  is  richly  paneled  in  carved  wood.  The  spacious  windows  admit  a  flood  of  light,  and  the  larger 
part  of  the  walls  is  lined  with  bookcases,  above  which  are  a  number  of  paintings  that  show 
to  advantage  on  the  dull  gold  with  which  the  room  is  finished.  There  are  wonderful  space  and 
comfort  in  this  room,  which,  although  located  structurally  at  the  very  end  of  the  house,  is 
its  real  center  and  social  head. 

The  second  story  is  wholly  given  up  to  bedrooms.  They  are  of  many  shapes  and  sizes, 
with  some  quite  unexpected  combinations  that  are  due  to  the  irregularity  of  the  plan.  At 
the  extreme  left,  over  the  drawing-room  and  porch,  are  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Taylor's  own  rooms, 
three  in  number.  The  first  is  a  boudoir,  and  from  this  the  two  bedrooms  open.  Both  are 
alike  in  plan.  They  are  lighted  with  dormers,  which  give  the  ceiling  the  shape  of  a  gambrel 
roof,  and  they  are  lined  throughout— both  walls  and  ceilings— with  oval  or  oblong ''panels. 
Red  and  white  tapestries  add  very  distinctly  to  the  great  charm  of  these  apartments. 

The  grounds  surrounding  "Talbot  House"  are  quite  extensive,  although,  as  Cedarhurst 
is  thronged  with  estates  and  summer  homes,  the  absolute  extent  is,  of  course,  somewhat 
limited.  The  outer  buildings  include  an  extensive  stable  .and  vast  conservatories,  while  the 
squash  court  should  not  be  overlooked.  Beyond  the  lawn,  below  the  end  porch,  is  a  beautiful 
enclosed  garden,  shut  in  with  high  hedges,  but  planted  in  good  taste.

The  American   Garden 


^f-^—'i 


The    Old-Time    Garden. 

HE  beauty  of  the  old-time  garden  never  lessens.  Year  after  year  it  has  bloomed  its 
fine  old  flowers;  year  after  year  its  hedges  have  thriven,  its  box  borders  grown  greener 
and  greener,  its  flowers  more  and  more  redolent  of  the  simple  life  of  the  past.  Very 
beautiful  these  fine  old  garden  spots  are,  and  very  rare,  for  the  march  of  progress 
and  the  changes  in  taste  have  swept  so  many  of  them  awa}'  that  comparatively  few  have 
survived  to  delight  the  eye  and  enchant  the  fancy  of  contemporary  folk. 

The  verv  rarity  of  these  gardens — of  good  old  gardens,  of  old  gardens  well  grown 
and  well  preserved,  of  old  gardens  that  to-day  are  as  brimful  of  old  plants  as  of  }'ore— adds 
vastly  to  the  present-day  appreciation  of  them.  The  jiassion  for  antiques  is  now  well-nigh 
universal,  and  old  gardens  are  among  the  rarest  of  antiquities,  because  their  survival  has 
meant,  in  most  cases,  more  years  of  continuous  care  and  thought  than  Americans,  as 
a  people,  are  apt  to  lavish  on  any  object.  The  old  garden  has  had  to  be  maintained  and 
tended  year  after  year,  and  from  sheer  love  of  its  beauty  and  old-timehness.  Its  survival 
is  hardly  short  of  a  miracle. 

The  old-time  gardens  teach  a  rare  lesson  of  constant  care  and  uninterrupted  interest. 
They  have  not  survived  by  accident  nor  through  inherent  sturdiness  of  growth.  Their  stout 
old  plants  have  needed  constant  replenishing;  the  l)orders  of  box  have  yearned  for  trimming; 
the  paths  have  cried  aloud  for  cleaning;  the  shrubbery  must  be  cut,  and  the  ^'ines  trained,  and 
the  whole  kept  in  that  spick-and-span  orderliness  which  seems  so  charmingh-  characteristic  of 
old-time  life. 

The  old-time  garden  makers  were  not  concerned  with  the  mighty  jiroblems  which  now 
beset  the  designers  of  modern  fine  gardens.  The  materials  at  their  hands  were  few  and  unim- 
portant. They  planted  shrubs  easy  of  cultivation ;  they  made  borders  of  ])lants  close  at  hand ; 
they  planted  the  seeds  of  ready  growing  annual  plants,  and  were  content  to  watch  their  sim|3le 
flowers  grow  and  bloom  and  transform  what  may  have  been  a  waste  into  a  bower  of  color 
and  foHage.  The  homehness  of  the  plants  was  the  best  evidence  of  the  dee])-seated  love  of 
the  old  garden  maker.  He  knew  little  of  vistas  and  axes,  and  of  garden  architecture  he  had 
never  heard;  but  out  of  the  simple  plants  that  thrived  in  the  open  soil  he  created  gardens  that, 
when  they  have  survived,  have  been  sources  of  unending  joy  to  those  who  knew  them,  who 
walked  in  their  narrow  paths,  and  loved  each  simple  old-time  flower.

AMERICAN     ESTATES     AND     GARDENS 

The  old-tiine  garden  was  an  individual  garden.  It  would  be  a  mistake  to  su]:.pose  that 
the  gardener,  the  specialist  in  garden  making,  is  a  new-fashioned  adjunct  to  the  country  house. 
The  modern  gardener  differs  from  the  old  gardener  exactly  as  the  modern  garden  differs  from 
the  old  garden.  But  ever  and  always  the  old-time  garden  was  an  individual  garden,  a  garden 
in  which  the  master  and  mistress  took  a  definite  personal  interest,  a  garden  in  which  the 
mistress  often  labored  with  her  own  hands,  and  which  she  regarded  as  her  very  own,  not 
alone  by  right  of  ownership,  but  by  right  of  actual  labor. 

The  old-time  garden  is  a  modest  garden,  alive  with  the  "common"  plants.  But  every 
one  of  these  lovely  old  plants— and  many  others— has  a  real  inherent  beauty  of  its  own, 
and  as  inherently  present  in  the  single  plant  as  in  a  whole  border.  If  they  are  "common," 
it  surely  can  not  be  because  they  are  coarse  and  ugly,  but  because  they  can  be  so  readily 
grown,  because  so  many  grow 
them,  and  because  of  their 
easy  culture,  that  they  seem 
scarcely  of  the  same  class  as 
the  more  difficulth'  grown 
plants  of  the  costly  modern 
garden. 

The  old-time  garden  was 
planned  on  the  simple  idea  of 
using  plants  that  grew  easily 
and  naturally,  with  perhaps  the 
slightest  effort,  and  certainly 
with  the  utmost  flowering.  It 
was  not  splendor  that  was 
sought,  but  charm,  the  charm 
of  foliage  and  of  color,  per- 
haps chiefly  the  charm  of  color. 
Plants  that  gave  these  results 
were  eagerly  sought  after  and 
industriously  cultivated.  It  is 
highly  significant  that,  beatx- 
tiful  as  these  old  gardens  must 
have  been  in  the  days  of  their 
first  blooming,  they  are  beau- 
tiful to-day,  and  do  not  suffer 
in  interest  in  comparison  with 
the  more  pretentious  efforts  of 
the  modern  gardener.

AMERICAN     P:STATES     AND     GARDENS 


The  Garden   ot  "Weld,"   Brookline,  Massachusetts. 


THE  TERRACE  STEPS. 


The  making  of  Italian  gar- 
dens is  the  most  characteristic 
tendency  of  garden  craft  in 
America.  It  is  an  art  so  refined 
and  beautiful,  that  is  so  finely 
effective,  that  gives  so  much 
pleasure  and  possesses  so  much 
absolute  beauty  in  itself,  that  it 
is  no  wonder  our  landscapes  are 
being  Italianized,  and  our  great 
houses,  when  it  can  be  fittingly 
done,  embowered  in  that  for- 
mal surrounding  of  architecture, 
sculpture,  and  plants  that  the 
garden  makers  of  Italy  knew  so 
well  how  to  use.  That  this 
type  of  garden  has  aroused  the  utmost  enthusiasm  in  this  country  is  established  by  its 
frequency,  and  that  it  has  led  to  many  very  beautiful  results  is  apparent  from  many  of  the 
garden  views  in  these  pages. 

The  Italian  garden  is  an  architectural  garden — that  is  to  say,  architecture,  and  its  great 
sister  art  of  sculpture,  are  essential  elements  in  its  design.  The  house — and  the  garden  'exists 
only  for  the  house — must  be  of  an 
art  and  design  that  will  harmonize 
with  the  somewhat  severe  forms  of 
classic  art  in  which  the  Italian  gar- 
den has  found  architectural  expres- 
sion. The  architectural  setting  of 
the  garden — the  enclosing  walls,  the 
pergolas,  the  rest  places,  the  seats, 
the  niches — may  then  be  as  elabo- 
rate as  one  chooses  or  as  simple. 

The  one  quality  that  leads  to 
success  in  the  making  of  an  Italian 
garden  is  harmony.  Beautiful  it 
must  be,  but  beauty  is  inseparable 
from  a  work  of  art.  The  garden 
must    l:)e    harmonious    in    plan;     its

parts  must  be  in  harmony  one  with  another;  there  must  be  no  discordant  note;  each  part 
must  be  so  designed  and  arranged  as  to  contribute  its  quota  toward  the  effect  of  the  whole. 
For  every  garden  must  be  a  whole,  in  which  every  plant  and  tree,  every  stone,  every 
elaborated  architectural  device,  every  piece  of  sculpture,  every  single  element  that  has 
place  in  it,  is  subordinated  to  finality  of  effect. 

The  beautiful  garden  of  "Weld,"  which  forms  a  portion  of  the  estate  of  Larz  Anderson, 
at  Brookline,  Massachusetts,  is  a  fine  type  of  the  Italian  garden  in  America,  designed  with 
a  wealth  of  architectural  accessories,  and  planted  with  discrimination  and  taste. 

The  architectural  framework  is  confined  to  the  bounding  enclostire.  It  is  nearly  square 
in  plan,  with  a  built-up  enclosure  of  terrace  and  balustrades  on  the  sides,  and  a  pergola  at  the

end  farthest  from  the  house.  In  the  space  before  the  pergola  is  the  fountain,  a  very  beautiful 
old  piece  of  work.  It  stands  at  one  end  of  the  niall,  which  runs  through  the  center.  On  either 
side  are  spaces  with  flower  beds  arranged  symmetricalh',  while  tubs  with  bay  trees  are  placed 
at  intervals. 

The  mall  and  flower  beds  are  at  the  lowest  level  of  the  garden.  Toward  the  outer  edge 
is  a  higher  walk,  paved  with  brick,  and  the  highest  level  is  reached  in  the  enclosing  walk,  which 
is  on  a  level  with  the  gazebos.  There  are  two  of  these,  placed  at  the  comers  nearest  the  house. 
The  formal  garden  is  shut  off  from  the  house  by  a  grove  of  trees.  A  beautiful  bowling  green 
stretches  between  the  grove  and  the  house.  The  latter  stands  on  the  apex  of  the  high  hill  on 
which  the  estate  is  situated.

AMERICAN     ESTATES     AND     GARDENS 


The    Garden    of  "Georgian    Court," 
1/akewood,   New   Jersey. 


The  fine  propei'ty  of  Mr.  Geoi-ge  J.  Gould,  at  Lakewood, 
New  Jersey,  has,  from  its  first  development,  excited  much 
ptiblic  interest.  The  house,  placed  among  the  pines  that 
throng  the  grounds  around  it,  was  the  favorite  work  of  its 
architect,  the  late  Bruce  Price,  and  the  garden,  which  was 
developed  some  years  after  the  house  had  been  finished,  was 
one  of  his  latest  designs. 

It  is  a  truly  sumptuous  garden,  most  elaborate  in  its 
architectural  setting,  stateh'  in  its  dimensions,  splendid  in  its 
planting  and  arrangement.  The  conditions  that  attended  its 
creation  were  exacth'  those  that  were  favorable  to  fine  realiza- 
tion. The  owner  is  a  man  of  culture,  and  possessed  of  a  fine 
appreciation  of  art  and  art  values;  there  was  great  wealth, 
without  which  rare  and  costly  works  of  art  can  not  be  produced 
or  accjuired;  there  was  a  fine  site — for  nature  had  already 
made  the  frame  that  awaited  only  the  creative  touch  of  the 
designer. 

And  that  was  the  last  essential,  and  in  some  respects  the 
most  important.  For  a  true  artist  can  redeem  the  most  barren 
landscape,  as  Le  Notre  and  his  associates  showed  at  Versailles, 
and  as  has  been  shown  many  a  time  again  where  barren  spots 

have   been   made   to  bloom  with   undying  beauty  of  nature  and   art.      But   Mr.  Gould   was 

fortunate  enough  to  have  as  his  architect  a  man  of  profoundly  keen  artistic  temperament, 

who  saw  a  magnificent  opportunity  in  the  creation 

of  this  garden,  and  who  rose  to  the  full  limit  of  his 

opportunity.       Thus,  under  Mr.    Price's   guidance, 

and  with  an  enthusiasm  that  was  almost  limitless, 

the  grounds  around  the  Gould  house  were  trans- 
formed, embellished,  adorned,  and  glorified.      It  is 

neither    necessary    nor    helpful    to    compare    this 

garden  with  any  other;    it  is  sufficient  that  it   is 

fine  and  distinctive,  and  these  two  words  sum  up 

about  the  utmost  limit  of  praise  of  any  work  of  art. 
Mr.  Price's  perception  of  proportion  and  fitness 

was  seldom  better  illustrated  than  here.      His  task 

was    to    create    a    garden,    and    he    did    that    and  A  MARBLE  SEAT.

nothing  else.  When  architecture  was  needed  for  retaining-walls  and  balustrades,  for  pergolas 
and  exhedras,  it  was  called  into  use,  and  architectural  adjuncts  employed  exactly  whei"e  they 
were  needed  and  nowhere  else. 

And  the  same  fine  rule  runs  through  the  whole  work.  Broad  paths  lead  to  points  of 
interest  and  create  fine  vistas.  Foliage  is  grown  where  it  will  help  in  the  creation  of  a  work  of 
beauty.  Vases,  statuary,  fountains,  and  seats  are  placed  where  they,  too,  have  a  definite 
note  in  the  general  effect.  Some  of  these  ornaments  are  of  rare  interest — all  of  them  are  of 
unusual  grace  and  richness ;   for  a  perfect  whole  can  not  be  made  out  of  imperfect  parts. 

The  electrical  fountain,  designed  by  J.  Massey  Rhind,  the  sculptor,  is  a  case  in  point. 
It  consists  of  a  white  marble  basin,  sixty  feet  in  diameter.     The  centerpiece  is  a  colossal  nautilus

horses.  White  marble  sea  nymjihs  are  pla^'ing  in  the  water.  On  the  front  of  the  shell  is  an 
octopus,  and  in  the  top  of  this  is  set  a  sheet  of  glass.  The  inner  and  outer  walls  of  the  shell 
are  sufihciently  wide  to  allow  for  an  electrical  attachment  and  lamps,  which,  when  lighted  with 
the  colored  lights,  throw  the  color  through  a  circle  of  manv  small  jets.  The  effect  is  enhanced 
bv  six  jets  of  water  falling  on  the  central  group. 

Mrs.    John    L.   Gardner's    Garden,   Brookline,    Massachusetts. 

Mrs.  John  L.  Gardner's  garden,  in  Brookline,  Massachusetts,  is  the  result  of  twenty 
years  of  continuous  growth  and  cultivation  under  one  owner.  This  fact  is  of  special  interest, 
for  most  of  the  fine  gardens  of  our  time  have  been  created  in  a  few  months  or  in  a  year  or 
two,  and  represent  a  definite  idea  carried  to  realization  within  a  very  brief  period.  Gardening 
art,  as  it  is  now  understood,  was  scarcely  known  in  America  when  Mrs.  Gardner  began  the 
arrangement  of  her  beautiful  grounds,  and  her  garden,  therefore,  has  been  slowly  evolved, 
although  long  ago  brought  to  its  present  high  state  of  culti^'ation. 

The  estate  is  a  considerable  one,  comprising  about  forty  acres.  The  intelligent  care 
that  has  been  lavished  on  it  for  so  many  vears  has  long  since  made  it  one  of  the  "show"  places

of  Massachusetts.  There  are  lovely  lawns,  well-kept  walks  shaded  with  bamboo  trellises 
covered  with  vines,  great  masses  of  brilliant  colors,  rhododendrons,  azaleas,  peonies,  roses, 
hardy  phlox,  dahlias,  and  many  other  flowering  shrubs  according  to  their  season,  beautifully 
planted,  with  a  very  fine  appreciation  of  their  blooming  values.  There  are  trees,  also,  many 
so  fine  and  rare  and  of  svich  grace  and  size  as  to  be  veritable  treasures. 

The  grounds  are  so  large,  so  well  wooded,  so  com])letel>-  cultivated,  that  the  estate  con- 
sists, in  a  sense,  of  a  series  of  gardens,  so  varied  is  the  treatment,  so  constant  the  surprise  of 
fresh  beaut>-  that  each  part  presents.  One  large  portion  is  entirely  enclosed  within  a  hedge  of 
fir  trees.  Low  rows  of  box  border  the  walks,  and  in  the  center  is  a  fountain — Neptune  standing 
proudly  on  a  sea  monster.  Roses  grow  profuseh-  in  this  space,  and  many  other  plants,  the 
season's  rapid  march  being  noted  in  quick  succession  of  exquisite  flowerings,  so  skilfully 
planted  that  each  seems  quite  predominating  in  its  own  special  time.  Farther  up  on  the  hill 
are  ponds,  in  which  are  tubs  and  jars  of  aquatic  plants,  many  of  great  rarity,  and  flourishing 
with  that  profusion  of  growth  which  is  the  satisfying  testimony  to  careful  tending.  A  Jap- 
anese  summer   house   has   been   built   between    the    ponds,    a   simple   little   house,    distinctly

Japanese,  and  yet,  with  these  growing  water  plants  so  close  beside  it,  quite  naturally  fitting 
into  the  immediate  landscape.  On  its  steps  are  Japanese  dwarf  trees,  each  in  its  own  little 
jar.  A  wonderful  view  over  the  surrounding  country  can  be  had  from  this  spot;  and,  indeed, 
the  lovel}-  vistas  and  ovitlooks  which  the  whole  estate  affords  are  not  the  least  of  its  many 
attractions. 

Like  all  great  gardens,  Mrs.  Gardner's  contains  many  works  of  art.  There  are  statues 
and  carved  seats,  there  are  great  vases,  and  a  fine  old  well  head  from  Rome.  One  wall  con- 
tains a  number  of  Latin  inscriptions,  brought  here  from  their  hiding-places  in  Italy.  Stone 
lanterns  from  Japan  and  Japanese  idols  are  also  employed  as  garden  ornaments. 

The  Garden  of  the  Hunnewcll    Estate,  Wellesley,  Massachusetts. 

Of  the  man}'  interesting  features  that  make  the  garden  of  the  Hunnewell  estate  at 
Wellesley,  Massachusetts,  remarkable,  none  is  more  striking  than  the  topiary  work,  in  which 
Mr.  H.  H.  Hunnewell  was  a  pioneer.  This  style  of  gardening,  which  consists  in  cutting  trees  and 
shrubs  into  ornamental  shapes,  has  long  been  a  favorite  method  in  England.  It  belongs,  of 
course,  to  the  formal  garden,  and  is  out  of  place  in  any  other.  Mr.  Hunnewell's  success  has 
been  the  more  notable,  since  in  England  the  results  have  been  achieved  with  yews,  which  do 
not  thrive  in  the  New  England  climate.  He  used,  therefore,  such  trees  as  were  suitable  to  the 
conditions,  and  emplo}-ed  pine,  spruce,  hemlock,  junipers,  arbor-vitae,  cedars,  and  Japanese 
retinosporas.

THE  STEPS  ON  THE  TERRACE, 


ame;rican   estates   and   gardens 

When  j^lanted  these  trees  were  very  small,  and 
for  twenty  years  their  growth  was  retarded  twice 
annually  in  order  to  induce  a  compact  and  close 
habit.  Many  of  them  are  now  more  than  forty 
feet  in  height  and  sixty  feet  in  circumference,  the 
hemlocks  especially  having  been  highly  successful. 
A  terrace  garden  borders  the  lake.  Below,  it 
is  contained  within  a  marble  retaining-wall ;  above 
is  a  pavilion,  with  red  roof  tiles,  supported  by 
red  sandstone.  The  terraces  have  been  treated 
as  Italian  gardens.  To  the  south  of  the  house  is 
a  fine  grove  of  pines,  including  an  avenue  bordering 
a  walk.  Beyond  them  is  the  rhododendron  garden, 
with'^'a  trellised  arbor,  to  which  curtains  may  be 
attached  to  shelter  delicate  jolants.  To  the  left 
of  the  rhododendron  garden  is  the  holly  path, 
between  beautifully  rounded  hedges  of  arbor-vitae. 
Beyond  the  hedges  are  the  greenhouses,  stables, 
and  jflower  garden.  In  the  height  of  sunmier,  the  flower  garden  is  filled  with  rich  bloom, 
and  here,  in  the  autumn,  is  a  magnificent  display  of  chrysanthemums. 

The  Hunnewell  estate  has  long  since  demonstrated  many  important  facts  in  American 
horticulture.  Mr.  Hunnewell  has  shown  that,  in  fifty  years,  it  is  possible,  with  suitable  care 
and  attention,  to  produce  a  garden  in  this  country  which  for  beauty  and  elaborateness  will 
favorably  compare  with  many  Old  World  gardens.  He  has  shown,  further,  that  American  trees 
and  shrubs,  or  trees  that  are  hardy  in  this  country,  are  as  capable  of  formal  treatment  as  the 
trees  more  ordinarily  used  for  such  purposes  abroad.  He  has  demonstrated  that  many  trees  of 
many  varieties  may  he  artistically  grouped,  and  that  an  outdoor  museum  of  plants  may  be 
as  attractive  and  as  beautiful  as  though  their  beauty  and  adaptability  to  beatitiful  effects 
were  the  chief  objects  sovight. 

The    Garden    of  Moses   Taylor,    Esq.,   Mount    Kisco,   New    York. 

The  beautiful  garden  attached  to  the  country  home  of  Moses  Taylor,  Esq.,  at  Mount 
Kisco,  New  York,  is  a  further  illustration  of  the  formal  garden  in  America. 

It  is  not  large,  but  has  been  designed  with  fine  taste,  with  a  small  pool  and  fountain 
in  the  center,  and  a  pergola  closing  the  vista  and  overlooking  the  valley  below  the  house.  The 
plan  includes  an  interesting  arrangement  of  beds  of  flowers  and  shrubbery,  and  is  an  excellent 
illustration  of  the  fine  effects  in  landscape  gardening  which  can  be  accompHshed  within 
comparatively  restricted  areas.     Mr.  Taylor's  garden,  however,  is  quite  ample  for  the  house.

The  terrace  is  very  beautiful.  It  has  been  wisely  planned  on  the  simplest  lines — a  mere 
open  space  among  the  tree  tops,  whose  size  is  enhanced  by  its  situation  and  by  the  great  trees 
which  immediateh-  surround  it.  The  stately  balustrade  is  properly  broken  and  supported  by 
pedestals  and  piers,  and  the  single  vases  appropriately  mark  off  the  borders  of  the  space 
toward  the  house.  It  is  an  excellent  example  of  good  results  accomplished  by  direct  means 
and  in  the  most  direct  way. 

The    Garden   of  Alfred    Nathan,  Esq.,  Elberon,  New  Jersey. 

The  garden  of  Alfred  Nathan,  Esq.,  at  Elberon,  New  Jersey,  is,  in  a  quite  literal  sense, 
a  garden  by  the  sea.  The  entrance  driveway  describes  a  circle  before  the  house,  and  encloses 
a  fountain — a  beautiful  circular  pool,  with  a  gracefvtl  little  figure  of  a  bo}^  embracing  a  swan. 
Stone  seats  are  placed  at  intervals  in  the  path  around  the  fountain.  The  formal  garden,  on 
the  right  of  the  house,  is  a  large  rectangular  area,  reached  by  marble  steps  and  laid  out  in 
paths  which  cross  each  other  at  right  angles,  meeting  in  a  central  circle,  in  which  is  a  sun-dial.

At  the  farther  end  is  a  great  stone  semicircular  seat,  with  vases  on  either  side.  Other 
seats,  rectangular  in  form  and  beautifully  carved,  are  ])laced  at  the  ends  of  the  cross  path. 
Behind  the  house  is  a  grassed  space,  laid  out  in  garden  style,  and  immediately  beyond 
is  the  ocean,  the  estate  being  directly  on  the  edge  of  the  water.  It  is  a  beautiful,  open  situation, 
devoid  of  trees,  it  is  true,  but  the  omission  is  largely  compensated  for  by  the  delightful  manner 
in  which  the  garden  has  been  planted  with  shrubs  and  flowers. 


The  Garden  of  Francis  Bartlett,  Esq.,  Prides  Crossing,  Massachusetts. 

The  garden  of  Mr.  Francis  Bartlett,  at  Prides  Crossing,  Massachusetts,  is  a  striking 
example  of  the  fine  gardens  with  which  the  eastern  part  of  Massachusetts  is  thronged.  It 
is  thoroughly  individual  in  design  and  in  development,  a  spot  of  wonderful  natural  beauty,  to 
which  art  has  given  a  special  note  of  charm  and  completeness.  A  long,  winding  driveway 
leads  up  through  lovely  woods 
to  the  house.  Just  before  it 
is  reached  the  road  passes  be- 
tween two  magnificent  Japan- 
ese bronze  lanterns. 

The  house  stands  on  a 
terrace,  the  road  within  a 
balustrade,  in  the  semicircular 
projections  of  which  are  placed 
immense  bronze  Japanese  vases, 
gigantic  works  of  art  with 
delicately  elaborated  surfaces. 
There  are  large  jars  of  Japanese 
pottery  on  the  balustrade  piers. 
In  the  center,  immediately  be- 
fore the  house,  is  a  vast  Japanese 
basin  of  bronze,  with  a  bronze 
water  fowl  beside  it,  standing  on 
a  mass  of  rocks  thickly  planted 
with  ferns  and  rock  shrubs. 

A  flight  of  steps  descends 
from  the  center  of  the  terrace 
to  the  formal  garden.  Its  flower 
beds  form  an  elaborate  geomet- 
rical design,  bordered  with  box, 
and    beautifully    planted    with  THE  BRONZE  BASIN  AND  FERNERY.

evergreens,  shi-ubs,  and  lirilliantly  flowering  annuals.  In  the  middle  of  the  central  path  is 
a  richly  carved  well  head,  and  at  'ts  end  a  trellised  arlwr.  And  all  around  the  garden,  completely 
shutting  it  in  rom  the  outer  world,  so  completely,  in  fact,  that  no  hint  is  given  of  the  street 
immediately  without  and  below,  are  trees,  great  forest  trees,  of  magnificent  height  and  foliage, 
a  curtain  wall  of  luscious  green,  at  once  impenetrable  and  lovely,  adding  to  the  beauty  of  the 
spot  and  giving  it  unexpected  charm  and  mystery. 

A    Terraced    Garden. 


The  terraced  garden  is  the  natural  garden  of  the  mountain  side.  It  may,  indeed,  l)e 
considered  a  type  quite  apart  by  itself,  since  a  garden  seems  instinctively  to  belong  to  level 
ground,  and  one  built  tier  above  tier  is  so  rare  as  to  be  exceptional.  This  very  unusual 
garden  is,  however,  beautifully  illustrated  in  the  estate  of  Mr.  O.  D.  Munn,  at  Llewellyn  Park, 
Orange,  New  Jersey.  The  mountain  side  rising  behind  the  house  has  been  converted  into 
terraces,  leveled  and  faced  with  grass,  and  laid  out  in  pleasing  variety. 

Yet  in  this  garden,  as  in  many  other  successful  gardens,  the  natural  configuration  of 
the  land  forms  the  basis  of  the  floral  ornamentation. 
The  house  stands  against  a  slope  of  the  Orange 
Mountain,  which  rises  to  a  considerable  height 
above  it.  This  at  once  determines  the  garden  and 
its  special  forms.  The  hillside  must,  indeed,  be  left 
bare,  or  subjected  to  ornamental  treatment,  and 
ornamental  treatment  both  demands  and  necessi- 
tates the  terrace  as  its  leading  feature,  if  it  does 
not  preclude  the  use  of  everything  else. 

This,  however,  amounts  to  no  limitation  what- 
ever in  the  hands  of  capable  garden  designers;  on 
the  contrary,  the  very  idea  is  so  novel  and  so 
interesting  that  an  additional  zest  is  given  to  the 
solution  of  a  problem  that  is  especially  fascinating 
through  its  very  difficulty.  And  the  creation  of 
a  garden  whose  chief  feature  is  to  be  a  series  of 
terraces,  ranged  one  above  the  other,  involves 
difficulties  of  arrangement  and  disposition  which 
will  not  be  apparent  at  the  first  conception  of  the 
idea.  Shall  the  terraces  V)e  treated  alike,  rising  in 
tier  above  tier  in  solemn  succession  of  identical 
forms?  Shall  they  be  wholly  ornamental,  or  will 
it  be  possible  to  put    some   of  them,    at  least,    to  A  MARBLE  SEAT.

some  utilitarian  puqDOSe?  And  if  the  planting  is  to  be  varied,  in  what  way  and  to  what 
extent  shall  it  be  done? 

The  relationship  of  the  garden  to  the  house,  and  its  own  natural  declivity,  vetoed  at 
once  any  suggestion  for  broad  terraces  with  considerable  horizontal  surfaces.  A  rising  series 
was,  therefore,  determined  upon,  as  at  once  the  most  natural  and  the  best  basis  of  design. 
The  terraces  are  artificial  in  so  far  as  the}-  have  been  given  regular  form  and  have  been 
leveled  and  faced  with  grass,  liut  they  closely  follow  the  basic  outline  of  the  natural  slope,  to 
which  they  bear  the  relationshi])  of  a  crown  and  ornament. 

Standing,  as  it  does,  on  a  hillside,  the  front  of  the  house  overlooks  a  vast  stretch  of 
territorv,  the  view  Ijeing  over  lawns  and  roads,  fields  and  trees,  with  New  York  itself — a  mere 
speck  in  the  landscape — dimly  visible  at  the  farthest  point.  The  terraces  are  at  the  Ijack  of 
the  house,  rising  far  above  it  to  a  lofty  grove  of  trees,  where  a  pleasant  summer  house, 
reached  liy  the  long  succession  of  steps,  affords  another  lookout  upon  the  country  below  and 
the  land  l)eyuml. 

The  first  terrace  alxjve  the  driveway  is  a  sloping  grass  bank,  adorned  with  a  marble 
fountain,  copied  from  an  Italian  church  font.  The  second  terrace  is  a  true  formal  garden, 
some  fifty  feet  wide  and  se\-eral  hundred  feet  long.  It  is  of  such  ample  size  that  room  is 
afforded  for  quite  extensive  floral  embelHshment.  It  is,  therefore,  laid  out  in  typical  foiTnal 
style,  with  graveled  paths  arranged  in  a  geometrical  design,  paths  bordered  with  box  and  low

hedges,  enclosing  shruljs  and  plants  of  great  variety.  It  is  not  the  least  remarkable  charac- 
teristic of  this  very  interesting  garden  that,  save  the  bay  trees  and  the  annuals — and  of  the 
latter  there  are  a  plenty — it  is  planted  throughout  with  hardy  American  shrubs,  or  with  those 
of  foreign  origin  that  flourish  well  in  this  climate.  Many  varieties  of  box  and  cypress  have 
been  used  here,  and  in  a  most  effective  way.  The  annuals  give  the  color  notes  that  are  V)Oth 
abundant  and  beautiful.  Everything  like  carpet  gardening  has  been  avoided,  and  the  annuals 
planted  for  effect  of  color  only— great  masses  of  bloom  and  foliage,  splendid  in  their  massing, 
yet  the  simplest  method,  and  the  one  which  yields  the  best  results. 

This  formal  garden  on  this  single  terrace  is  so  large  in  size,  and  has  reahzed  so 
completely  the  purpose  of  its  designer,  that,  were  there  nothing  else,  the  garden  would  still 
have  great  interest.  But  it  is  the  other  terraces — there  are  nine  in  all — which  give  the 
distinctive  character  to  this  estate.  Above  the  formal  garden  comes  the  kitchen  garden. 
In  most  estates  these  two  would  be  quite  widely  separated,  possibly  by  lawns  and  paths, 
certainly  by  green  hedges,  which  would  hide  the  homely  kitchen  garden  from  its  brilliant 
neighbor.  But  in  the  present  case  there  was  no  room  for  th^'s  great  surface  development; 
nor,  indeed,  was  there  necessity  for  it;   for  the  terraces  supphed  ample  room  for  Ijoth  gardens

by  the  very  simple  device  of  planting  their  edges  or  borders  with  flowering  plants,  while 
the  humbler  vegetables  flourished  within  and  behind  them. 

Low  flowering  plants  are  used  for  the  lower  borders,  and  higher  ones  for  the  upper, 
a  system  that  perfectly  maintains  the  individuality  of  the  terraces.  Had  high  flowering 
plants  been  used  on  the  lower  terraces,  the  individual  effect  of  each  would,  to  a  certain 
extent,  have  become  confused.  The  system  that  has  been  followed  gives  each  terrace  its  own 
character,  which  is  ftxrther  heightened  by  the  development  of  a  careful  color  scheme,  each 
terrace  having  a  well  marked  color  of  its  own.  Thus,  one  has  a  border  of  red;  another  is 
rich  in  yellow;  in  a  third,  purple  will  be  the  chief  color,  while  blue  and  white  or  other 
shades  are  represented  in  others.  All  these  borders  are  so  laid  out  that  each  plant  in  its 
season  is  followed  by  another  variety,  so  that  the  entire  garden  will  be  in  gorgeous  bloom 
the  entire  summer. 

At  the  stmimit,  and  on  the  sides,  the  whole  of  this  great  ascending  garden  is 
enclosed  within  a  thick  forest  growth,  that  frames  it  splendidly  and  beatttifully  helps  in 
giving  it  individuality.  It  is  thus  no  unrelated  spot  upon  the  hillside,  but  a  complete  and 
finished  garden,  novel  in  design  and  arrangement,  and  yet  so  completely  natural  that  no 
other  kind  of  a  garden  could  have  been  developed  here  or  been  so  effective.
