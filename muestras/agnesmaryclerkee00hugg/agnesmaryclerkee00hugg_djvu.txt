FOREWORD 

Lady  Huggins  in  her  original  draft 
of  the  obituary  notice  of  my  sister 
Agnes,  which  appeared  in  the  As- 
trophysical  Journal,  included  some 
words  of  personal  appreciation  and 
of  reference  to  her  family  which 
were  omitted  from  the  copy  sent 
for  publication,  as  being,  possibly, 
somewhat  beyond  the  scope  of  a 
purely  scientific  journal.  At  my 
request    Lady    Huggins     has    con- 


vi  FOREWORD 

sented  to  the  full  original  draft, 
with  a  few  additions,  being  pub- 
lished for  private  circulation.  She 
has  also,  to  my  great  gratification, 
and  entirely  on  her  own  initiative, 
taken  this  opportunity  of  adding  an 
appreciation  of  my  elder  sister. 

My  sisters'  acquaintance  with 
Lady  Huggins  commenced  only 
after  they  had  been  some  time 
permanently  resident  in  London ; 
and  for  the  accuracy  of  the  state- 
ments relating  to  their  earlier  lives 
I  am  alone  responsible.  Their 
father   had  died    before  the   period 


FOREWORD  vii 

of  which  Lady  Huggins  speaks  from 
personal  knowledge ;  and  perhaps  it 
is  fit  that  I  should  supplement  what 
she  says  as  to  the  influence  of  family 
life  upon  the  characters  and  careers 
of  my  sisters  by  mentioning  a  few 
facts  connected  with  my  father. 
Although  a  classical  scholar  of 
Trinity  College,  Dublin,  his  interests 
were  for  the  most  part  scientific. 
In  our  earliest  years  his  recreation 
was  chemistry,  the  consequential 
odours  of  which  used  to  excite  the 
wrath  of  our  Irish  servants.  Later 
a  "big  telescope"  (4  inch  aperture) 


viii  FOREWORD 

was  mounted  in  the  garden,  and  we 
children  were  occasionally  treated 
to  a  glimpse  of  Saturn's  rings,  or 
Jupiter's  satellites.  In  an  age  before 
railways  and  telegraphs  had  reached 
the  remote  parts  of  Ireland  and 
before  clocks  were  "  synchronised 
with  Greenwich,"  the  local  time 
would  have  gone  "all  agley"  had  it 
not  been  for  my  father's  observa- 
tions with  his  "  orthochronograph." 
These  trivial  things  show  that  it  was 
in  an  environment  of  scientific  sug- 
gestion that  our  early  lives  were 
passed  ;  and  to  me,  at  all  events,  my 


FOREWORD  ix 

father's  influence  was  more  than 
suggestion,  for  to  his  painstaking 
teaching  I  have  to  attribute  any- 
little  successes  which  I  subsequently 
achieved. 

It  is  difficult  for  me  to  express 
to  Lady  Huggins  my  thanks  in 
fitting  terms,  for  to  thank  implies 
a  service ;  and  her  work  has  been 
not  a  service  to  me,  but  a  labour 
of  love  for  those  whose  simple  lives 
she  records.  Still  I  may  say  that 
I  am  deeply  gratified  by  this  finished 
product  of  her  pen,  and  that  I 
rejoice   that   she    should   have   con- 


FOREWORD 


ceived  the  idea  of  writing  this  Ap- 
preciation, thereby  enabling  me  to 
place  it  before  the  eyes  of  many 
friends. 

I  have  to  thank  Director  Frost 
of  the  Yerkes  Observatory  for  his 
permission  to  reprint  that  part 
of  the  "  Appreciation "  which  has 
already  appeared.

AGNES   MARY   CLERKE 

Agnes  Mary  Clerke  was  born  on 
February  10,  1842,  at  Skibbereen, 
a  small  country  town  in  a  remote 
part  of  the  County  Cork.  Her 
father  was  John  William  Clerke ; 
and  her  mother  was  a  sister  of  the 
late  Lord  Justice  Deasy. 

Constitutionally  delicate,  Agnes 
Clerke  from  her  earliest  years,  as 
so  often  is  to   be  noticed  in   cases 


2    AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

of  frail  health,  found  her  chief 
delight  in  literary  study  and  in 
music.  From  quiet  talks  often 
enjoyed  with  her  in  her  later  life, 
it  was  clear  that  the  thoughtful- 
ness  of  Agnes  Gierke,  and  her 
liking  for  probing  difficult  pro- 
blems, must  have  developed  early. 

This  is  not  the  place  for  enlarg- 
ing upon  the  family  influences  of 
her  home  life,  but  it  should  be 
said  that  these  were  truly  foster- 
ing, and  that  she  was  a  devoted 
and  loving  daughter,  to  whom  the 
parental    sympathy,    strongly  given 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE    3 

on  both  sides,  was  at  once  inspira- 
tion and  joy.  Mrs.  Gierke  was  a 
remarkable  woman,  with  rare  powers 
of  insight  and  of  capacity  for  love. 
Her  conversational  powers  were  of 
a  high  order,  as  was  her  musical 
ability.  Those  privileged  to  be  pre- 
sent at  her  afternoon  gatherings  will 
not  easily  forget  their  pleasures ; 
and  intimate  friends  will  long  re- 
member the  charms  of  her  music. 
Her  rendering  of  old  Irish  airs  on 
Ireland's  national  instrument — the 
harp — was  delightful ;  and  so  indeed 
was  her  piano-playing.     She  told  me 


4    AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

one  day  near  the  close  of  her  Hfe, 
when  near  her  eightieth  birthday, 
that  she  practised  on  her  instruments 
every  day.  This  was  interesting ;  and 
showed  that  power  of  persevering 
work — even  under  the  natural  dis- 
abilities of  age — which  was  a  marked 
feature  in  her  daughter  Agnes. 

The  bust,  a  photograph  of  which 
is  here  reproduced,  was  executed  in 
Rome  when  Mrs.  Gierke  was  about 
fifty  years  of  age. 

In  considering  the  fostering  influ- 
ences of  Agnes  Gierke's  home  life, 
that    of   her   only   brother,    Aubrey 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE    5 

St.    John    Gierke,   should    be    men- 
tioned. 

Mr.  Gierke  won  the  first  gold 
medal  of  Trinity  Gollege,  Dublin, 
in  Mathematics  at  his  Degree  ex- 
amination in  1865,  and  was  awarded 
a  studentship  of  £100  a  year  for 
seven  years — the  highest  honour 
obtainable  at  the  Degree  examina- 
tion. He  also  won  the  second  gold 
medal  conferred  by  the  Univer- 
sity for  Experimental  and  Natural 
Science. 

Mr.    Gierke    has    told   me — what 
indeed     I     always     believed  —  that 


6    AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

although  not  professing  to  be 
a  mathematician,  his  sister  s  per- 
ception of  mathematical  truth  was 
singularly  clear ;  and  I  feel  sure 
that  her  brother's  mathematical 
powers  and  knowledge  of  Natural 
Science  were  a  great  advantage  to 
her,  for  the  helpfulness  of  thorough 
sympathy  is  very  great.  In  her 
later  life  she  took  lessons  in  mathe- 
matics, and  expatiated  to  me  on 
the  pleasure  she  felt  in  them.  Not 
that  she  aimed  at  making  herself 
a  mathematician  ;  she  was  too  wise 
to  so  err.      Her  object  was  simply 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE    7 

to  go  far  enough  to  enable  her  to 
do  better  her  own  particular  work. 
No  one  that  I  have  known — man 
or  woman — better  understood  that 
the  half  may  be  better  than  the 
whole ;  that  the  art  of  doing,  con- 
sists, greatly,  in — not  doing.  She 
could  renounce.  And  in  these  days 
great  renunciation  is  necessary  if 
useful  work  is  to  be  done. 

In  1861  the  Gierke  family  moved 
to  Dublin,  and  in  1863  to  Queens- 
town.  The  winters  of  1867  and  of 
1868  were  spent  at  Rome ;  those  of 
1871  and  1872  at  Naples;   and  the 


8    AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

next  four  winters  at  Florence — the 
summers  of  1874-76  being  passed  at 
the  Bagni  di  Lucca.  Both  sisters 
profited  to  the  full  from  this  sojourn 
in  Italy,  as  their  subsequent  writ- 
ings show ;  but  Agnes  at  Florence 
worked  specially  hard,  reading  con- 
stantly in  the  Public  Library  there, 
and  always,  I  believe,  with  one 
great  object  before  her. 

It  is  a  question  of  much  interest 
to  examine  into  the  early  leanings 
and  aspirations  of  those  who  dis- 
tinguish themselves  later,  and  Agnes 
Gierke     early    determined    her    life 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE    9 

work.      Before   leaving    Skibbereen, 

about  the   age   of  fifteen,    she   had 

clearly  before   her   the   intention  of 

writing    a     history    of    Astronomy, 

and  it  is  thought,  had  actually 
written   a   few  chapters.      Her  first 

article  accepted  for  the  Edinburgh 
Review,  is  in  harmony  with  the 
above  facts. 

Agnes  Gierke's  first  wish  to  ex- 
amine into  Science  generally,  was 
roused  by  the  perusal  of  Joyce's 
Scientific  Dialogues-^  but  as  regards 
Astronomy,  Sir  John  Herschel's 
Outlines   was    her    earliest    guide — 


10  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

and  I  can  imagine  how  much  this 
really  great  book  was  to  her,  from 
my  own  early  use  of  it. 

Well  do  I  remember  reading  an 
article  in  the  Edinburgh  Review  for 
October  1880,  on  "The  Chemistry 
of  the  Stars."  I  admired  it  much  : 
I  wondered  who  had  written  it,  for 
it  seemed  to  me  to  be  unlike  the 
work  of  any  one  then  known  in  the 
scientific  world.  Five  years  later  I 
solved  my  puzzle,  for  in  1885  ap- 
peared the  History  of  Ast?vnomy 
in   the  Nineteenth    Century  \    and  I 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE  11 

had  not  looked  far  into  it  before 
I  exclaimed:  "Now  I  know  who 
wrote  that  article  in  the  Edinhurgli 
Review ! " 

Shortly  after — dining  at  a  house 
where  to  dine  was  always  to  share 
in  a  feast  of  reason  and  flow  of 
soul — and  sitting  between  our  dis- 
tinguished and  kindly  host  Sir 
William  Bowman,  and  Sir  Robert 
Ball,  Sir  Robert  and  I  exchanged 
ideas  about  the  new  History  of 
Astronomy,  and  about  its  author, 
the  new  "Unknown."  With  all 
his     own     acuteness,     Sir     Robert 


12  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

showed  that  the  writer  could  not 
be  a  practical  astronomer.  But  I 
was  dehghted  to  find  that  my  ad- 
miration for  the  History  was  fully 
shared  by  him,  and  that  his  praise 
of  it  was  very  warm. 

Shortly  afterwards  I  entered  upon 
a  friendship,  and  upon  a  companion- 
ship in  Astronomy,  which  have  been 
among  my  best  pleasures. 

Agnes  Gierke's  literary  life  may 
be  said  to  have  begun  in  1877 
with  the  acceptance  of  her  article 
"Copernicus    in    Italy,"    by    Henry 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE  13 

Reeve,  then  editor  of  the  Edin- 
burgh Review,  who  recognised  the 
value  of  his  new  contributor  and 
kept  her  at  work.  The  number  of 
her  contributions  to  the  Edinburgh 
is  fifty ;  and  they  are  all  of  a  high 
order. 

Agnes  Gierke,  with  her  family, 
returned  to  England  in  1877,  and 
settled  in  London.  With  the  publi- 
cation of  the  History  of  Astronomy 
in  1885  may  be  said  to  have  begun 
her  astronomical  life. 

She  read  systematically,  and  culti- 
vated personal  relations  with  a  wide 


14  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

circle  of  astronomical  workers,  in 
person,  or  by  correspondence.  I 
consider  that  these  relations  had 
much  to  do  with  the  success  of  her 
work.  Her  sympathies  were  so 
keen,  her  interest  so  warm,  her 
longing  for  further  truth  so  intense, 
— that  every  one  liked  to  offer  her 
all  they  could ! 

In  1890  appeared  her  second  book, 
The  System  of  the  Stars. 

The  Observatory  for  December 
1890  contains  an  article  by  me  on 
this  work.  A  review,  in  the  strict 
sense  of  the  term,  it  was  not,  because 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE  15 


there  was  much  in  the  book  which, 
for  obvious  reasons,  I  could  not 
discuss  without  becoming  contro- 
versial. But  upon  one  important 
question  I  spoke  strongly;  and  I 
venture  now  to  recall  and  re-urge 
the  position  I  then  tried  to  expound. 
Briefly  it  is  this.  The  progress  of 
Science  and  the  growth  of  its  litera- 
ture during  the  last  quarter  of  a 
century  has  been  so  enormous,  that 
a  new  order  of  worker  is  impera- 
tively called  for;  and  I  hailed  in 
Agnes  Gierke  an  admirable  example 
of  such    a  worker,   devoting   herself 


16  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

to  Astronomy,  which  is  at  once  the 
oldest  and,  in  its  new  developments, 
the  youngest  of  the  Sciences — the 
science  which  Poincare  has  lately 
so  eloquently  declared  has  given 
the  conception  of  law  to  all  the 
others. 

I  ventured  to  sketch  what  should 
be  the  qualifications  and  aims  of 
such  workers ;  and  the  years  which 
have  gone  by  since  1890  have  but 
deepened  my  conviction  that  there 
is  a  splendid  and  ever-growing  field 
— even  now  white  unto  harvest — 
ready     for    these    special     workers. 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE  17 

Their  mission  is  to  collect,  collate, 
correlate,  and  digest  the  mass  of 
observations  and  papers — to  chronicle, 
in  short,  on  one  hand ;  and  on  the 
other,  to  discuss  and  suggest,  and 
to  expound :  that  is,  to  prepare 
material  for  experts,  and  at  the 
same  time  to  inform  and  interest 
the  general  public.  There  is  urgent 
need  of  better  educated  public 
opinion  in  this  country. 

That  such  a  mission  may  be  a 
splendid  and  fruitful  one  has  been 
shown  by  Agnes  Gierke ;  what  care- 
ful preparation  it  requires,  and  how 


18  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

much  it  demands  of  those  who 
would  enter  upon  it,  her  career 
also  shows. 

The  immense  increase  in  astrono- 
mical literature  is  hardly  realised 
except  by  those  engaged  in  dealing 
with  it.  To  give  but  one  instance — 
"  The  Annual  Index  of  Astronomical 
Literature  for  1905,"  published  under 
the  auspices  of  the  Astronomische 
Qesellschaft,  contains  over  two 
thousand  references,  collated  from 
three  hundred  separate  publications. 

The  strain  of  such  work  as  I  am 
indicating  is  great  indeed,  involving, 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE  19 

as  it  should,  the  power  of  holding 
loose  in  the  mind,  so  to  speak,  an 
immense  mass  of  facts,  and  also  a 
power  of  rapidly  associating  or  dis- 
sociating them  as  work  and  discovery 
may  suggest. 

In  one  of  her  latest  works.  Modern 
Cosmogonies,  Agnes  Gierke  herself 
dwelt  upon  this  strain.  "Year  by 
year,"  she  says  (p.  160),  "details 
accumulate,  and  the  strain  of  keep- 
ing them  under  mental  command 
becomes  heavier." 

Pathetic  words  !  written — almost 
in  blood !     For  not  long  before  had 


20  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

been  published  her  last  large  work, 
Problems  in  Astrophysics  ;  a  work  she 
feared  she  could  not  live  to  com- 
plete— a  work  which  at  times  she 
was  only  able  to  toil  at  for  half- 
hour  periods. 

All  through  her  life  Agnes  Gierke 
was  a  student.  Lectures  and  Friday 
Evening  Discourses  at  the  Royal 
Institution  which  bore  upon  her 
work  she  was  careful  to  attend. 
A  three  months'  visit  to  Sir  David 
and  Lady  Gill  at  the  Cape  in 
1888    gave    her    some    Observatory 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE  21 

opportunities  which  increased  her 
power  of  clearly  realising  the  re- 
cords of  observatory  and  laboratory 
work.  Sir  George  Baden -Powell 
invited  her  to  accompany  his  yacht- 
ing party  to  Novaya  Zemlya  for 
the  solar  eclipse  of  August  1896. 
When  I  expressed  very  strongly 
my  regret  that  she  had  declined 
this  invitation  (chiefly  I  now  know 
because  she  feared  she  might  be 
prevented  from  keeping  literary  en- 
gagements absolutely  to  time),  she 
surprised  me  a  week  later  with  an 
earnest    request    that     she    and     I 


22  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

should  form  a  little  expedition  of 
two,  and  try  what  we  could  see. 
She  had  divined  an  unspoken 
longing  of  mine,  and  I  cannot 
refrain  from  recording  the  unsel- 
fish love  that  would  fain  have 
gratified  me.  But  it  could  not  be. 
She  was  awarded  in  1892  the 
Actonian  Prize  of  one  hundred 
guineas  for  her  works  on  Astronomy, 
by  the  Royal  Institution ;  and  in 
1901  was  commissioned  by  the 
Managers  to  write  the  first  Essay 
under  the  Hodgkins  Trust,  on  Low 
Temperature  Research  at  the  Royal 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE  23 

Institution  by  Professor  Sir  James 
Dewar  from  1893-1900. 

In  1903  she  received  the  dis- 
tinction of  being  elected  an  Hon. 
Member  of  the  Royal  Astronomical 
Society — an  honour  and  title  held 
previously  only  by  Mrs.  Somer- 
ville,  Caroline  Herschel,  and  Ann 
Sheepshanks.  I  may  perhaps  be 
permitted  to  say  that  my  own 
deep  gratification  in  my  share  of 
this  great  honour  conferred  on  us 
by  the  Society  was  heightened  by 
receiving  it  with  Agnes  Gierke. 

She  was  a  frequent   attendant  at 


24  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

the  meetings  of  both  the  Royal 
Astronomical  Society  and  the  British 
Astronomical  Association,  and  always 
an  interested  one.  Occasionally  she 
spoke ;  but  she  had  no  liking  for 
speaking  in  public,  nor  indeed  was 
she  well  suited  for  it. 

A  complete  list  of  Agnes  Gierke's 
papers  it  would  be  difficult  to  com- 
pile. They  were,  in  truth,  innumer- 
able. Her  articles  on  astronomers 
for  the  IHctionary  of  National 
Biog7^aphy  —  out  of  the  sixty -six 
volumes  which  constitute  this  great 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE  25 

work  there  are  only  eleven  to  which 
she  did  not  contribute, — articles  for 
the  Eiicyclopcedia  JBritannica,  and 
for  other  encyclopgedias  were  many, 
and  all  of  them  were  models  of 
painstaking  inquiry  and  of  clear, 
concise  statement.  The  more  im- 
portant of  these,  that  on  Laplace  in 
the  Encyclopcedia  Britannica,  for  in- 
stance, are  of  lasting  interest  and 
value. 

Her  larger  works  are  : — 

History  of  Astronomy  in  the 
Nineteenth  Century  (4  editions). 

The  System  of  the  Starts. 


26  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 


Familiar  Studies  in  Homer, 

The   Herscheh  and  Modern  As- 
tronomy, 

Concise  Histoi^y  of  Astronomy, 

Modern  Cosmog07iies, 

Problems  in  Astrophysics, 

I  venture  to  think  that  the 
History  of  Astronomy  in  the  Nine- 
teenth Century  is  the  most  important 
of  her  works.  It  is  admirable  in  its 
completeness  of  references,  its  wide 
inclusiveness,  and  in  its  lucidity.  It 
deserves  to  live,  and  it  assuredly  will 
live — the  invaluable  continuation  of 
Grant's  fine  work.      The  System  of 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE  27 

the  Stars  and  the  Problems  in  Astro- 
physics are  works  of  a  different  order. 
Treasuries  of  knowledge  and  of 
suggestion  they  certainly  are. 

The  Homeric  Studies,  except  in 
one  chapter,  are  not  specially  astro- 
nomical ;  but  they  are  evidence  of 
width  of  culture  and  of  wide  intel- 
lectual interest,  and  are  full  of 
delightful  touches  of  wit  and  of 
humour. 

The  Herschels  is  excellent  and 
agreeable  biographical  reading.  Three 
lives  are  vividly  set  forth  in  little 
more  than  two  hundred  octavo  pages. 


28  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

It  seems  to  me  a  mistake  to  regard 
Agnes  Gierke's  smaller  works  as  of 
less  importance  than  her  larger  ones. 

I  have  said  that  I  consider  the 
History  her  greatest  work.  But,  in 
some  respects,  I  venture  to  think 
that  her  greatest  achievement  is 
Modern  Cosmogonies.  I  claim  for 
this  book  that  it  is  not  only  a 
history,  but  a  work  of  philosophical 
thinking  and  of  imaginative  insight 
of  a  very  high  order. 

Its  small  size  is  an  accident.  It 
is  a  work  essentially  great.  In  these 
superbly    brilliant     sketches    Agnes 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE  29 

Gierke's  style  is  at  its  best.  Usually, 
it  suffers  from  effort ;  the  lucidity 
may  be  laboured,  and  the  perpetual 
antithesis  may  sometimes  be  weary- 
ing. I  have  spoken  of  her  labori- 
ousness  in  study  and  in  work,  and 
can  adorn  the  tale  by  relating  what 
was  surely  a  very  remarkable  per- 
formance. .  She  had  at  the  time 
no  knowledge  of  Portuguese,  but  as 
part  of  her  preparation  for  an  article 
in  the  Edinburgh  Review  "Don 
Sebastian  and  his  Personators,"  in  six 
weeks  she  not  only  acquired  con- 
siderable knowledge  of  the  language, 


30  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

but  read  the  whole  of  the  Lusiad 
in  the  original ! 

Le  Style,  cest  Vhomme ;  is  it  sur- 
prising that  the  physical  efforts  she 
made  I  fear  only  too  often,  tended 
to  render  her  writing  laboured  at 
times  ? 

But  the  writing  in  Mode7^n  Cos- 
mogonies, good  as  it  is,  is  a  small 
matter  compared  with  the  masterly 
grasp  of,  I  may  say,  all  things,  and 
of  their  inter-relations,  which  the 
work  reveals.  And  where  else  is 
shown  in  recent  philosophical  writing 
such   vision   and   faculty   divine   for 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE  31 

seizing  and  pointing  out  the  reason- 
able spiritual  clues,  set  in  what  we 
call  Nature, — clues  helping  to  sustain- 
ment  of  soul  in  the  midst  of  the 
majestic  mysteries  surrounding  us  ? 

No  sketch  of  Agnes  Gierke  would 
be  complete  without  reference  to  her 
love  of  music.  To  her  music  was  in 
the  highest  sense  of  the  term  a 
recreation.  She  turned  to  it  for  very 
life.  Her  piano  -  playing  was  truly 
musicianly,  and  her  repertory  was 
large.  Perhaps  on  the  whole,  her 
playing  was  at   its   best  in   render- 


32  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

ing  Chopin.  As  an  accompanist 
she  excelled.  Her  teachers  were, — 
in  Dublin,  Miss  Flynn ;  in  Florence, 
Buonamici. 

I  record  here  the  complete  story 
of  her  introduction  to  Liszt.  One 
moonlight  night  in  the  spring  of 
either  1868  or  1869,  Mrs.  Gierke 
and  her  daughters  rambling  about 
Rome  were  fascinated  by  such 
piano  -  playing  as  they  had  never 
before  heard,  and  they  stopped  out- 
side the  open  window  of  the  villa 
and  listened  spellbound  until  the 
unknown  Maestro  had  finished  and 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE  33 

came  to  the  window  to  look  out 
upon  the  night.  Then  the  enthu- 
siasm of  the  hearers  overcame  con- 
ventionaUty,  and  they  gave  free 
expression  to  their  admiration ;  and 
the  fifth  act  of  the  little  drama  was 
that  Liszt  invited  his  listeners  to 
enter,  promising  to  play  again  on 
condition  that  Agnes  first  played 
for  him,  which  I  believe  she  did. 

Remarkable  as  were  the  intel- 
lectual powers  of  Agnes  Gierke,  her 
moral  endowments  were  equally  so. 
It  was  a  question  we  frequently  de- 
bated— the  influence  of  character  on 

3 


34  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

work ;  and  as  I  write  the  memory  of 
certain  talks  is  hauntingly  present. 
As  is  the  heart,  is  the  work.  The  best 
work  is  and  must  be  associated  with 
lofty  character.  It  was  so  with 
Agnes  Gierke.  No  purer,  loftier, 
and  yet  sweetly  unselfish  and  human 
soul  has  lived.  She  was  so  incapable 
of  meanness  that  she  even  incurred 
danger  as  a  historian  in  crediting 
too  readily  all  workers  with  her  own 
high  ideals. 

As  a  friend  and  companion  she 
was  faithful  and  true,  and  full  of 
charm;  and  without  her  the  world 


AGNES  MARY  CLERKE  35 

to    those    who    had   her    friendship 
seems  darkened  and  empty. 

But  her  mission,  I  must  believe, 
was  accompUshed.  For  twenty  years 
she  had  been  to  modern  Astronomy 
an  admirable  historian,  and  had  kept 
before  working  astronomers  clear 
charts,  so  to  speak,  of  what  was 
being  done,  and  of  what  should 
and  might  be  done.  In  so  doing 
she  rendered  splendid  service,  and 
inaugurated  a  kind  of  work  which 
must  be  more  and  more  needed — a 
kind  of  work  which  not  only  advances 
Astronomy,  but  promotes  a  universal 


36  AGNES  MARY  CLERKE 

brotherhood  and  co-operation,  golden 
indeed. 

Agnes  Gierke's  death  comes  as  a 
shock  to  many.  A  cold — I  fear  not 
sufficiently  nursed  at  first  —  led  to 
pneumonia  and  complications,  and  in 
spite  of  all  that  devoted  love  and 
skill  could  do,  she  passed  gently  to 
the  next  life,  peaceful  and  fully 
conscious  almost  to  the  last,  on  the 
morning  of  January  20,  1907.

by  Mendelssohn  in  1895.

ELLEN    MARY    CLEKKE. 


ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE 

Ellen  Mary  Clerke,  the  only  sister 
of  Agnes  Clerke,  whose  interest  in 
Astronomy  was  also  keen,  was  born 
at  Skibbereen  on  September  26, 
1840.  She  shared  her  sister's  life, 
and  her  devotion  to  her  contributed 
not  a  little  to  the  perfect  fulfilment 
of  its  mission. 

Acutely  sensitive  to  the  beautiful, 
and  with  a  rare  capacity  for  enthusi- 


40    ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE 

asms,  Ellen  Gierke  was  first  of  all 
a  poet.  But  she  was  much  besides. 
She  was  an  accomplished  linguist ; 
and  the  years  she  spent  in  Italy  were 
devoted  to  such  study  of  Italian 
literature  as  enabled  her  later  to  do 
excellent  original  work  in  connection 
with  it.  An  admirable  article  by 
her  in  the  Dublin  Review  for  October 
1879,  on  "The  Age  of  Dante  in  the 
Florentine  Chronicles,"  well  deserves 
remembrance,  so  full  is  it  of  the 
illumination  of  wide  reading  and 
of  careful  thinking.  Alas  !  only 
too  many  articles  by  her  have  passed 


ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE    41 

into  magazine  oblivion.  Some  of 
these  were  written  in  foreign  tongues 
— a  sure  proof  of  mastery  of  them. 
For  instance,  in  1869  she  published 
a  pamphlet  in  German  with  the  title 
Das  Judentlium  in  der  Musik ;  while, 
besides  many  articles  and  reviews  in 
Itahan  in  the  Florentine  periodicals, 
she  published  in  one  of  these  a  serial 
story  in  Itahan,  called  Sotto  le  Sette 
Stelle,  She  had  also  a  knowledge 
of  Arabic  by  no  means  inconsider- 
able. 

Her  interest  in  geographical  science 
was  not  generally  known  ;    but  she 


42    ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE 

was  a  valued  member  of  the  Man- 
chester Geographical  Society,  and 
contributed  to  its  Journal. 

As  regards  Astronomy,  she  has 
left  useful  evidence  of  her  warm  in- 
terest in  the  subject  in  two  excellent 
popular  monographs,  and  in  various 
articles. 

A  list  of  Ellen  Gierke's  works  is 
given  at  the  end  of  this  sketch,  but 
special  mention  must  be  made  of  her 
work  as  a  journalist.  Her  friends 
might  regret — as  I  did  for  one — 
that  so  much  of  her  time  was  thus 
spent;    but,  after  all,  journalism   is 


ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE    43 

what  the  journalist  makes  it ;  and  it 
cannot  be  denied  that  it  is  a  great 
and  increasing  power  in  our  midst. 

Assuredly  Ellen  Gierke  always 
used  her  opportunities  as  a  journalist 
for  noble  ends.  For  the  last  twenty 
years  of  her  life  she  wrote  a  weekly 
leader  for  the  Tablet, —  usually  on 
subjects  connected  with  the  Church 
abroad ;  and  on  several  occasions 
during  the  temporary  absence  of  the 
Editor  she  filled  his  place  at  his 
request. 

Many  of  her  literary  articles  con- 
tributed to  various  periodicals  were 


44    ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE 

critical,  and  that  she  was  a  generous 
and  encouraging  as  well  as  a  capable 
critic  the  following  facts  pleasingly 
illustrate. 

In  the  Westmiiister  Review  for 
October  1878  she  had  an  article  on 
"  The  later  Novels  of  Berthold  Auer- 
bach."  It  met  the  eye  of  the  novelist, 
and  he  directed  to  be  sent  to  her  a 
copy  of  his  Landolin  von  Reuters- 
hofen,  inscribed  :  "  To  the  Author  of 
the  article  in  the  Westminster  Review, 
October  1878,  with  kind  regards  of 
Berthold  Auerbach.  Berlin,  Nov. 
14,  1878." 


ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE    45 

It  is  singular  that  the  poems  of 
Ellen  Gierke,  published  in  1881, 
should  not  have  attracted  more 
attention.  The  volume  is  now,  I 
believe,  almost,  if  not  entirely,  out  of 
print ;  and  partly  on  this  account, 
partly  because  of  its  subject  and  of 
its  beauty,  I  give  here  one  of  the 
poems. 

NIGHT'S   SOLILOQUY 

Who  calls  me  dark  ?  for  do  I  not  display 
Wonders  that  else  man's  eye  would  never 
see? 

Waste  in  the  blank  and  bUnding  glare  of  Day, 
The  heavens  bud  forth  their  glories  but  to  me. 

Is  it  not  mine  to  pile  their  crystal  cup, 

Drain'd  by  the  thirsty  sun  and  void  by  day. 


46   ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE 

Brimful  of  living  gems,  profuse  heap'd  up. 
The  bounteous  largesse  of  my  royal  way  ? 

Mine  to  call  o'er  at  dusk  the  roll  of  heav'n. 
Array  its  glittering  files  in  order  due  ? 

To  beckon  forth  the  lurking  star  of  Even, 
And  bid  the  constellations  start  to  view  ? 

The  wandering  planets  to  their  paths  recall. 
And  summon  to  the  muster  tenant  spheres. 

Till  thronging  to  my  standard  one  and  all, 
They  crowd  the  zenith  in  unfathom'd  tiers  ? 

Do  I  not  lure  stray  sunbeams  from  the  day. 
To  hurl  them  broadcast  as  wing'd  meteors 
forth  ? 

Strew  sheaves  of  fiery  arrows  on  my  way. 
And  blazon  my  dark  spaces  in  the  north  ? 

Is  not  a  crown  of  lightnings  mine  to  wear. 
When   polar   flames  suffuse    my  skies   with 
splendour  ? 
And  mine  the  homage  with  the  sun  to  share. 
His  vagrant  vassals  rush  through  space  to 
render  ? 


ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE   47 


Who  calls  me  secret  ?  are  not  hidden  thinss. 

Reveal'd  to  science  when  with  piercing  sight 
She  looks  beneath  the  shadow  of  my  wings. 

To  fathom  space  and  sound  the  infinite  ? 

In  plasmic  hght  do  I  not  bid  her  trace 

Germs  from  creation's  dawn  maturing  slow  ? 

And  in  each  filmy  chaos  drown'd  in  space 
See  suns  and  systems  yet  in  embryo  ? 

Miss  Gierke  specially  enjoyed 
romantic  subjects;  and  the  sea  and 
shipping  appealed  to  her  strongly. 
Her  ballad  on  7'he  Flying  Dutchvian 
legend  is  one  of  the  finest  treatments 
of  the  subject  I  have  met  with,  and  it 
is  to  be  regretted  that  it  is  not  better 
known,  for  it  would  lend  itself  well 
both  to  the  reciter  and  to  the  musician. 


48    ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE 

The  volume  of  poems  gave  evidence 
of  a  special  gift  which  in  later  years 
the  author  cultivated  with  great 
success, — that  of  verse  translation. 
Her  delightful  and  valuable  book, 
Fable  and  Song  in  Italy,  is  illus- 
trated throughout  with  her  own 
versions ;  and  although  I  do  not 
pretend  to  have  compared  each 
version  with  its  original,  I  venture 
to  say  that  the  translations  are,  as  a 
whole,  wonderfully  faithful,  and  that 
when  the  number  of  them,  and  the 
variety  of  subjects  and  of  measures, 
are  considered,  the  verse  part  alone 


ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE    49 

of  the  work  is  a  notable  achievement. 
The  prose  part  is  more  than  a  mere 
setting ;  it  is  full  of  touches  of  illu- 
minating thought,  and  many  little- 
known  facts  are  brought  together 
suggestively,  while  many  of  the 
descriptive  passages  are  wonderfully 
vivid.  In  Dr.  Garnett's  History  of 
Italian  Literature  the  English  ver- 
sions selected  by  him  from  Boiardo 
and  some  other  poets  were  by  Ellen 
Gierke. 

Ellen  Gierke's  literary  style  was 
lighter  and  more  spontaneous  than 
her  sister's.

50    ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE 

Like  her  sister  she  was  highly 
musical,  and  her  instrument  was  the 
guitar.  A  pupil  of  Madame  Pratten, 
she  had  through  the  practice  of  many 
years  acquired  a  mastery  of  the  in- 
strument unusual  in  an  amateur, 
managing  it  with  great  skill,  and 
arranging  for  it  many  an  accompani- 
ment. To  the  last  almost,  her  sing- 
ing to  the  guitar  was  full  of  charm  ; 
and  in  earlier  years  when  the  sisters 
sang  together  to  her  guitar  accom- 
paniment the  performance  was  de- 
lightful. 

A  devoted  and  exemplary  Catholic, 


ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE    51 

Ellen  Gierke  was  untiring  in  her  zeal 
for  all  good  works.  Unselfish  and 
loving,  she  was  a  devoted  daughter, 
sister,  and  friend.  Fonder  of  society 
than  her  sister,  it  was  perhaps  natural 
that  she  did  not  pursue  literary  work 
in  the  same  persistent  way.  And  it 
fell  in  with  her  sociability  that 
she  pulled  a  good  oar  and  enjoyed 
riding. 

These  sisters  were  lovely  and 
pleasant  in  their  lives,  and  in  death 
they  were  but  httle  divided.  Ellen 
Gierke  died  after  a  short  illness  on 
March  2,  1906.

leader   contributed    for    twenty 
years  to  the  Tablet.

System.     (1892.) 
Monograph  on  Venus,     (1893.) 
An  article  in  the  Observatory,  vol. 

XV.  p.  271. 
The  monographs  on  Jupiter  and 
on  Venus,  although  unpretentious, 
are  based  upon  careful  reading  of 
the  best  authorities,  and  are  written 
in  a  way  which  places  them  above 
the  ordinary  popularisers. 

The  article   above   referred  to  in 
the  Observatoi^y  was  the  outcome  of 


54   ELLEN  MARY  CLERKE 

her  Arabic  reading,  and  showed  that 
there  can  be  little  doubt  that  the 
variability  of  Algol  had  been  noticed 
by  the  Arabian  astronomers.
