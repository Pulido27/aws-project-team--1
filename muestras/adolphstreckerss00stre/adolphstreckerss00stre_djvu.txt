PREFACE 

TO 

THE    ENGLISH    EDITION. 


The  great  popularity  which  Professor  "Wislicenus's  edition  of 
Strecker's  'Text-book  of  Organic  Chemistry'  has  enjoyed  in 
Germany  leads  to  the  belief  that  an  English  translation  will  be 
acceptable.  In  the  interval  that  has  elapsed  since  the  publication 
of  this  book  in  Germany  considerable  additions  have  been  made  to 
our  stock  of  knowledge  in  organic  chemistry,  necessitating  many 
alterations  and  additions  to  the  text.  On  this  subject  Professor 
Wislicenus  has  written  as  follows  : — 

1 1  willingly  give  permission  to  publish  a  translation  of  my  work, 
and  only  beg  that  regard  shall  be  had — so  far  as  the  scope  and 
purpose  of  the  book  necessitate — to  the  largely  increased  material  and 
essentially  nearer  insight  into  the  relations  and  nature  of  the  organic 
compounds  already  known  that  has  been  obtained  since  the  publish. 
ing  of  my  book.  So  far  as  this  is  done  it  will  be  the  work  alone 
of  the  translators,  as,  from  the  occupation  of  my  time  by  olHcial  duties, 
I  have  found  it  impossible  to  take  part  in  the  very  necessary  correo- 
tions  and  additions.' 

From  this  it  will  be  seen  that  the  translators  are  entirely  r. 
sible  for  such  alterations  as  have  been  made,  these  being  most 
numerous  in  the  part  on  the  aromatic  compounds.  In  the  case  «■! 
tlie  naphthalene  compounds  it  has  been  thought  advisal.li>  to  introduce 
the  syml>ols  proposed  by  Reverdin  and  Niilting  as  the  most  Suitable 
provisional  notation. 

In  conclusion  the  translators  have  to  express  their  thanks  to  Mi. 
R.  Meldola  for  the  account  of  the  diazo  colours  that  has  been  printed

AUTHOE'S    PEEFACE 


At  the  time  of  Adolph  Strecker's  sudden  death,  in  1871,  he  was 
about  to  begin  the  sixth  edition  of  his  short  hand-book  of  *  Organic 
Chemistry.' 

The  publishers,  who  wished  as  far  as  possible  to  retain  the 
peculiar  nature  of  this  valuable  work,  requested  me  to  undertake 
the  necessary  revision.  I  have  not  undertaken  this  duty  without 
hesitation.  Tied  for  several  years  by  my  official  duties,  I  could 
scarcely  depend  on  quickly  overcoming  the  work.  Moreover,  I 
doubted  if  I  could  succeed  in  satisfactorily  uniting  the  necessary 
independence  in  the  arrangement  of  the  material  with  the  deep 
respect  felt  towards  the  late  author.  This  latter  consideration  dis- 
appeared on  finding  that  Strecker  had  himself  acknowledged  the 
necessity  of  a  total  revision  of  the  book,  and  had  spoken  of  an  en- 
tirely altered  classification.  As  also  the  thought  of  completing  the 
suddenly  interrupted  work  of  so  estimable  a  man  was  not  without 
strong  temptations,  I  finally  decided  to  undertake  this  new  duty. 

It  may  be- as  well  to  point  out  the  general  method  of  arrange- 
ment that  has  been  adopted.  A  scientific  text-book  that  is  neither  a 
primer  nor  a  dictionary  must  have  its  contents  arranged  in  accordance 
with  two  considerations — the  state  of  the  science  at  the  time,  and,  on 
the  other  hand,  the  requirements  of  those  for  whom  it  is  primarily 
intended.  This  necessitates  some  difficulties  and  inequalities  of 
treatment. 

In  the  classification  of  organic  compounds  the  hydrocarbons 
without  doubt  form  the  most  convenient  starting  point,  as  being 
relatively  of  the  simplest  composition,  and  also  being  the  substances 
from  which  all  others  can  )>e  derived  by  simple  or  complex  replace- 
ment of  hydrogen.  In  the  hydrocarbons,  again,  the  first  place  is 
taken  by  those  containing  the  maximum  contents  of  hydrogen,  the 
paraffins.  Those,  however,  are  here  preceded  by  the  cyanogen 
derivatives,  on  account  of  the  resemblance  of  the  latter  to  mineral

compounds  and  their  constant  employment  in  the  synthesis  of  organic 
substances  ;  with  the  cyanogen  group  are  almost  necessarily  included 
the  carbon  oxyamides  and  guanidine. 

The  most  systematic  arrangement  would  be  founded  on  the 
number  of  carbon  atoms  in  direct  union.  In  each  such  group  of 
equal  carbon  contents  the  paraffin  would  come  first,  next  those  de- 
rivatives in  which  only  a  single  hydrogen  atom  had  been  replaced, 
these  being  further  arranged  according  to  the  valency  of  the  sub- 
stituting element.  Then  would  follow  the  di-substitution  products, 
i.e.  the  derivatives  of  the  hydrocarbon  nucleus  CnH2n,  arranged 
according  to  the  relative  order  of  the  two  positions  of  replacement. 
Next  would  follow  the  trisubstituted  paraffins — compounds  of  the 
nucleus  CnH2n-i>  &c.,  arranged  according  to  analogous  principles. 
Erlenmeyer  has  commenced  this  classification  in  his  text-book,  un- 
fortunately as  yet  without  passing  beyond  the  dicarbonides. 

This  order  of  arrangement  is  very  valuable  for  the  study  of 
organic  chemistry,  more  so,  however,  for  those  moderately  well 
acquainted  with  the  subject  than  for  beginners.  For  the  latter,  I 
do  not  consider  the  study  of  homologous  series  to  be  superfluous, 
especially  in  the  early  part  of  a  text-book.  In  this  way  alone  can 
the  clear  differentiation  of  the  various  categories  of  bodies  be  made 
evident,  depending  as  they  do  not  so  much  on  the  accumulation  of 
carbon  atoms  as  on  the  nature  and  amount  of  the  other  elements  in 
union.  In  addition  to  this  the  study  of  these  series  considerably 
assists  the  perception  and  mastering  of  the  substance  of  the  book  and 
the  grouping  of  large  numbers  of  facts  under  typical  reactions.  In 
this  form  we  can  advance  the  otherwise  over-worked  theory  of  types 
into  a  wider  field.  In  every  homologous  series  there  can,  then,  be  made 
out  the  laws  of  evolution  and  complication  with  increasing  number 
of  carbon  atoms  as  well  as  the  order  of  structural  synthesis. 

As  far  as  the  selection  of  the  facts  to  be  considered  is  concerned, 
I  follow  in  general  those  principles  which  have  hitherto  characterised 
Strecker's  text-book.  That  additions  are  required  by  the  chemical 
results  of  the  last  few  years  is  self-evident.  The  simpler  categories 
of  chemical  compounds,  such  as  the  derivatives  of  the  alcohol  radicals 
CnH2n+1  and  the  next  more  complex  group,  required  broader  treat- 
ment in  many  places,  whilst  the  compounds  of  the  nuclei  poorer  in 
hydrogen  could  be  treated  more  shortly,  as  those  relationships  already 
mentioned  would  otherwise  be  repeated. 

The  group  of  benzene  derivatives  has,  as  is  generally  customary, 
been  considered  separately.  The  time  is  probably  not  far  distant 
when  such  a  separation  will  be  neither  necessary  nor  advisable  ;  it 
will  not,   however,  come  until  the  gaps  still   existing  between  the 


AUTHOKS    PKEFACE.  IX 

aromatic  and  fatty  groups  have  been  filled  up,  and  further  proof  given 
of  that  continuity  of  group  relations  which  is  already  visible. 

In  the  present  state  of  our  science  we  cannot  neglect  the  frequent 
use  of  structural  formulae  based  on  the  valency  of  the  chemical 
elements.  Their  partial  uncertainty  and  in  many  points  tangible 
shortcomings  need  not  prevent  their  use  to  some  extent  in  a  text- 
book, although  their  use  requires  care.  With  regard  to  the  manner 
of  writing  the  constitutional  formula,  no  dogmatic  adherence  to  any 
single  method  will  be  adopted,  so  that  the  formula  of  one  and  the 
same  substance  may  be  found  varyingly  written  in  different  places. 
With  every  one  of  these  systems  of  formula?  there  is  the  danger  of 
substituting  a  concrete  image  in  place  of  an  idea.  These  images  we 
certainly  cannot  do  without,  but  we  must  keep  the  idea  lying  behind 
such  an  image  as  far  as  possible  pure,  and  also  mobile,  seeing  that  in 
comparison  with  older  views  we  have  in  it  only  relative,  not  absolute 
truth. 

I  hope  that  this  text-book  in  its  new  form  may  be  found  to  have 
sufficient  merit  to  justify  its  existence,  that  its  imperfections  may  not 
impede  its  usefulness  to  either  scholar  or  teacher,  and  that  it  may  in 
the  future  maintain  that  rank  which  it  had  acquired  under  Adolph 
Strecker's  care.

ORGANIC    CHEMISTRY. 


INTRODUCTION.       ' 

1.  Until  the  early  part  of  the  present  century  organic  chemistry 

was  denned  as  the  study  of  those  bodies  derived  from  the  working  of 
animal  or   vegetable  life,  together  with  their  numerous  compounds 

and  derivatives.  It  was  assumed  that  for  the  conversion  of  mineral 
substances  into  organic  bodies  there  was  requisite  a  peculiar  force 
only  existing  in  the  living  organism,  and  essentially  different  from 
that  which  regulated  the  apparently  simpler  laws  of  mineral 
chemistry. 

The  enormous  development  of  organic  chemistry  in  recent  times 
has,  however,  gradually  obliterated  this  line  of  distinction  between 
organic  and  mineral  bodies. 

The  number  of  organic  bodies  built  up  from  their  elements,  or 
from  their  simplest  mineral  combinations,  is  on  the  increase,  and  the 
results  in  the  region  of  artiiieiitl  synthesis  approximate  nearer  and 

nearer  to  the  highest  stages  of  chemical  complication — the  immediate 
agents  of  organic  life — the  cellular  constituents  of  plants  and 
animals. 

The  laws  which  govern  organic  synthesis  have  shown  themselves 
to  be  in  no  way  different  from  those  concerned  in  the  changes  and 
combinations  of  mineral  substances. 

The  best  arbitrary  definition  of  organic  chemistry  is  one  depend- 
ing on  the  fact  that  all  organic  bodies  contain  carhon  as  the  essential 
constituent,  for  it  is  to  the  chemical  characteristics  of  carbon  alone 
that  the  compounds  termed  organic,  compared  with  mineral  com- 
pounds, owe  their  peculiar  character. 

2.  Constituents  of  Organic  Bodies.     N"aturaUy  occurring  organic 

bodies  contain  hut  a  limited  number  of  elements  in  eombinat  ion  with 
carhon,    many    only    hydrogen    or    oxygen  ;    many    more   Contain    both 

hydrogen  and  oxygen,  and  others  again,  these  in  addition  to  nitrogen, 
sulphur  or   metals. 

By  artificial  methods  all  the  elements  may  be  obtained  m  integral 
constituents  of  carhon  compounds,  the  base  forming  metals  giving 

salts  with  organic  acids  being  in  thifl  way  combined  to  the  carbon  by 
means  of  oxygen,  sulphur,  Ac,  and  also  many  elements  combining 
directly  to  the  carUm,  in  most  of   which  cases  the  elements    lose  their

distinctive  characters,  by  which  they  are  known  in  mineral  or  inor- 
ganic compounds,  and  are  only  discoverable  after  the  action  of  the 
most  powerful  reagents  or  the  employment  of  a  high  temperature, 
by  which  all  organic  compounds  are  more  or  less  decomposed  or 
destroyed. 

3.  The  determination  of  the  composition  of  an  organic  body  is  a 
primary  step  towards  an  exact  knowledge  of  its  nature  and  constitu- 
tion, and  the  chemistry  of  the  carbon  compounds  received  a  great 
impetus  from  the  discovery  of  exact  methods  of  organic  elementary 
analysis. 

Before  proceeding  to  the  determination  of  the  proportions,  by 
weight,  of  an  element  contained  in  a  compound,  all  the  other 
elements  or  constituents  of  the  body  must  be  known,  since  methods  of 
analysis  must  be  varied  according  to  their  nature  and  peci^iarities. 
Qualitative  analysis  must  therefore  always  precede  quantitative.  In 
naturally  occurring  bod  is  it  is  necessary  to  test  for  the  presence  of 
carbon,  hydrogen,  oxygen,  nitrogen,  sulphur,  and  the  constituents  of 
the  ash  or  residue  left  on  combustion.  In  artificial  bodies  built  up 
from  their  elements  this  is  not  necessary,  as  the  individual  compon- 
ents are  already  known. 

In  the  following  sections  an  outline  of  the  general  methods 
employed  will  be  given. 

Qualitative  Elementary  Analysis. 

4.  Carbon. — Most  organic  bodies,  on  heating  out  of  contact  with 
air,  decompose  with  blackening  from  separation  of  carbon.  Volatile 
bodies  are  passed  through  hot  tubes,  on  which  they  give  a  black 
deposit.  It  is  better  to  depend  on  the  formation  of  carbonic  anhy- 
dride when  the  body  is  burnt  with  oxygen,  a  test  of  universal  appli- 
cation. For  this  purpose  non- volatile  bodies  are  mixed  with  cupric 
oxide  and  heated  ;  volatile  bodies  or  gases  are  led  over  ignited  cupric 
oxide ;  the  carbonic  anhydride  formed  is  then  passed  into  a  solution 
of  calcic  hydrate,  with  which  it  gives  a  white  precipitate  of  calcic 
carbonate. 

5.  Hydrogen. — The  presence  of  hydrogen  is  shown  by  heating  the 
dried  substance  with  cupric  oxide,  when  water  is  formed,  which 
collects  in  drops  on  the  cold  portions  of  the  apparatus.  Organic  bodies 
containing  oxygen  as  well  as  hydrogen  give  off  water  when  heated 
alone. 

6.  Nitrogen. — Most  nitrogenous  bodies,  when  heated  alone  in  a 
glass  tube,  give  an  odour  of  burnt  feathers,  whilst  ammonia  is  evolved, 
and  can  be  recognised  in  the  vapours  by  its  turning  red  litmus  paper 
blue.  In  many  cases  volatile  acids  are  evolved  at  the  same  time, 
which  completely  neutralise  the  ammonia.  It  is  better,  therefore, 
before  ignition,  to  mix  the  body  under  examination  with  an  alkaline 
hydrate ;  soda  lime  is  generally  employed.  This  latter,  at  high 
temperatures,  directly  oxidises  the  organic  body,  completely  retains 
the  carbonic  anhydride  formed,  whilst  the  nitrogen,  uniting  with  the 
hydrogen  of  the  organic  substance  or  of  the  alkaline  hydrate,  is 
evolved  as  ammonia. 

Very  small  quantities  of  nitrogen  are,   however,    readily    over-

looked  by  this  method,  which  also  frequently  fails  if  the  nitrogen  is 
united  to  oxygen,  as  nitry]  (NO.,),  in  the  organic  body.  The  following 
method  is  of  general  application  and  complet-lv  certain  : — A  small 
quantity  of  the  substance  is  mixed  with  a  little  sodium  or  potassium 
(with  addition  of  dry  sodic  carbonate  in  the  case  of  explosive  Bubstam 
and  heated  in  a  test  tube;  the  action  is  generally  accompanied  by  .1 
slight  explosion.  The  residue  is  boiled  with  water  and  some  ferrous 
sulphate,  and  then  acidulated  with  sulphuric  acid  ;  a  ferrocyanide  is 
thus  obtained,  which,  on  addition  of  a  drop  of  ferric  salt,  gives  a  pre- 
cipitate of  Prussian  blue. 

7.  Sulphur  owl  Phosphorus. — These  and  other  analogous  acid- 
forming  elements  (such  as  selenium,  tellurium,  arsenic,  antimony)  are 
most  conveniently  tested  for  by  heating  the  Mispected  body  with  a 
mixture  of  pure  potassic  carbonate  and  nitrate.  The  aqueous  solu- 
tion of  the  white  fused  mass  is  then  tested  in  the  usual  manner  for 
sulphate,  phosphate,  &C. 

8.  Halogens. — In  those  cases  where  the  aqueous  solution  of  the 
substance  gives  no  indication,  a  small  quantity  of  the  body  is  heated 
with  pure  lime  in  a  test  tube.  The  residue  is  dissolved  in  dilute 
nitric  acid,  and  a  few  drops  of  argentic  nitrate  added  ;  a  white  curdy 
precipitate  indicates  chloride,  bromide,  or  iodide.  The  separation  of 
these  elements  is  conducted  in  the  usual  manner. 

9.  The  examination  for  other  elements  is,  as  a  rule,  made  by 
ignition  of  the  organic  substance  and  examination  of  the  ash.  Only 
very  volatile  metals  are  overlooked  without  further  precautions. 
Mercury  compounds,  e.g.,  are  ignited  in  a  glass  tube  in  a  current  of 
oxygen,  the  liquid  metal  then  condensing  on  the  cold  portion  of  the 
tube. 

It  is  not  generally  practicable  to  prove  the  presence  of  oxygen 
directly,  the  complete  quantitative  analysis  alone  showing  its  presence 
without  doubt.

10.  Carbon  and  hydrogen  are  estimated  in  a  single  operation. 
A  weighed  quantity  of  the  substance  is  burnt,  converting  the  carbon 
into  carbonic  anhydride  and  the  hydrogen  into  water;  these  latter  are 
then  conveyed  into  weighed  absorption  apparatus,  and  the  carbon  and 
hydrogen  calculated  from  the  increase  of  weighl  observed. 

Pure  cupric  oxide  is  the  material  usually  employed  in  the  com- 
bustion ;  at  a  rod  heal  it  readily  gives  up  its  oxygen  to  the  organic 
bodies,  being  thereby  reduced  to  metallic  copper.  The  water  i-

(fig.  2).  In  these  the  gas  first  passes  into  the  largest  brill),  from  which 
it  expels  the  potassic  hydrate,  and  then  passes  in  single  bubbles  through 
the  other  bulbs,  and  being  thus  necessarily  in  long  contact  with  the 
potash,  is  very  completely  absorbed.  The  modification  of  this  ap- 
paratus  known   as  Geissler's  bulbs  is  also  much  used.     Instead  of

potash  solution,  soda  lime  is  frequently  used  to  absorb  carbonic 
anhydride.  This  is  rubbed  in  a  porcelain  mortar  until  a  mixture  of 
fine  powder  with  pieces  the  size  of  coarse  millet  remains.  U-shaped 
light  glass  tubes  (fig.  3),  which  contain  in  one  limb,  between  two 

plugs  of  cotton  wool  a  and  b,  coarsely 
powdered  calcic  chloride,  are  completely 
filled  up  with  the  soda  lime;  by  tapping 
the  tube  with  both  limbs  placed  hori- 
zontally the  separation  of  the  fine  from 
the  coarse  powder  is  effected.  The 
latter  occupies  the  upper  part  of  the 
cross -section,  and  forms  a  passage 
through  which  the  gases  pass,  and  from 
which  the  finer  powder  absorbs  the 
carbonic  anhydride.  In  cases  where 
soda  lime  tubes  are  employed  a  small 
bulb  tube  g,  containing  a  drop  of  sul- 
phuric acid,  is  usually  placed  between  the  calcic  chloride  and  soda  lime 
tubes ;  it  serves  to  show  the  rate  at  which  the  combustion  is  pro- 
gressing. 

Combustions  are  conducted  in  many  different  ways.  Two  methods 
will  be  described,  of  which  the  oldest  and,  as  regards  apparatus,  the 
simplest  will  always  be  connected  with  the  name  of  Liebig.  The 
solid  substance  to  be  analysed,  having  been  dried  and  previously  finely 
powdered,  is  weighed  (generally  0*2  to  0*3  gram  is  taken)  and  mixed 
with  finely  powdered  cupric  oxide  in  a  warm  porcelain  mortar.  The 
cupric  oxide  must  have  been  ignited  just  before  the  operation,  trans- 
ferred whilst  still  hot  to  a  wide  glass  tube,  which  is  then  carefully 
closed,  and  cooled  so  far  as  not  to  alter  the  organic  substance  when 
mixed  with  it.  A  tube  of  difficultly  fusible  glass  must  have  been 
previously  prepared  for  the  reception  of  the  mixture.  This  combustion 
tube  (fig.  4)  is  drawn  out  at  one  end  (over  the  blowpipe)  to  a  tail  at 
an  obtuse  angle,  then  carefully  cleaned  and  dried.     The  end  is  filled

up  to  c  with  pure  cupric  oxide;  then  follows  the  mixture  of  the 
organic  substance  and  cupric  oxide  to  b  ;  from  there  to  a  is  the  cupric 
oxide  used  in  rinsing  out  the  mortar.  The  tube  is  then  filled  up  to 
within  an  inch  of  its  mouth  with  pure  cupric  oxide,  and  finally  a 
loose  plug  of  asbestos  is  inserted.  The  length  of  the  layer  of  cupric 
oxide  must  vary  with  the  combustibility  or  volatility  of  the  organic 
body,  so  that  for  such  bodies  as  give  on  heating  a  large  volume  of  com- 
bustible vapours  and  gases  it  must  be  made  longer  than  it  otherwise

would.  The  tube  is  then  held  horizontally  and  tapped  gently,  by  winch 
means  a  canal  is  formed  along  the  top  of  the  contents,  along  which  the 
products  of  combustion  can  pass.     The  tube  so  prepared  is  then  laid  in 

a  combustion  furnace;  the  chloride  of  calcium  tube  is  fitted  on  by 
means  of  a  good  cork  or  caoutchouc  plug,  and  in  its  turn  is  connected 
to  the  potash  bulbs  by  means  of  a  piece  of  caoutchouc  tubing.  The 
whole  apparatus  is  shown  in  fig.  .").  The  fore-part  of  the  combustion 
tube  is  now  heated,  and  as  soon  as  the  cupric  oxide  is  glowing  the 
heating  gradually  curried  backward,  so  that  the  mixture  of  substance 
and  cupric  oxide  is  raised  to  the  temperature  necessary  for  combustion.

In  order  to  prevent  any  condensation  of  onburnt  volatile  decomposition 

products  in  the  tail,  that  is  kept  heated  from  the  boundary  of  the  pure 

cupric  oxide.  When,  at  length,  the  whole  tube  is  brought  to  a  red  heat, 

and  no  more  gas  bubbles  are  Been  in  the  potash  bulbs,  the  combustion 

is  finished.     The  tail  of  the  combustion  tube  Is  broken  off  at  C  and  air

anhydride  contains   ,'•,   of  its  weight   of  carl ,  and  «  of  its 

Weight  of  hydrogen,  by  multiplying  the  increase  in  weight  of  the 
spective  tubes  by  these  figures,  the  amount  of  carbon  and  hydrogen  in 

the  substance  employed  will  be  obtained.

11.  When  readily  volatile  liquids  have  to  be  analysed  in  this  ap- 
paratus they  are  placed  in  small  previously  weighed  bulbs,  the  point 
fused,  and  the  bulb  again  weighed,  in  order  to  ascertain  the  weight  of 
the  substance  taken.  The  combustion  tube  is  then  filled  for  a  quarter 
of  its  length  with  fre-hly  ignited  cupric  oxide,  the  bulb,  with  its  point 
broken,  then  dropped  in,  and  the  tube  filled  up  with  cupric  oxide. 
The  apparatus  is  arranged  as  in  fig.  5  ;  the  front  and  back  parts  of 
the  tube  first  brought  to  redness,  and  then  that  part  where  the  bulb 
is  gradually  heated,  so  that  the  vapour  of  the  liquid  shall  slowly  pass 
over  the  glowing  oxide  and  be  completely  burnt. 

Non- volatile  liquids,  fats,  &c,  are  caused  to  spread  over  the 
sides  of  the  combustion  tube,  which  is  then  filled  up  with  cupric 
oxide. 

12.  In  many  cases  it  is  necessary  to  make  some  alterations  in  the 
method  above  described.  Some  organic  substances  cannot  be  com- 
pletely burnt  with  cupric  oxide,  either  from  not  admitting  of  sufficiently 
intimate  admixture  or  from  their  yielding  much  carbon  on  heating, 
which  cannot  come  into  contact  with  sufficient  cupric  oxide  for  its 
complete  combustion.  In  these  casts  plumbic  chromate  is  employed 
instead  of  cupric  oxide.  Immediately  before  use  it  must  be  strongly 
heated  in  a  porcelain  basin.  It  contains  more  oxygen  in  an  equal 
volume  than  cupric  oxide,  fuses  on  heating,  and  gives  off  oxygen  on 


strong  ignition.  Plumbic  chromate  is  of  use  also  in  the  analysis  of 
bodies  containing  sulphur  and  halogens,  as  it  completely  retains  them  ; 
whilst  with  cupric  oxide  sulphurous  anhydride  or  free  halogen  is 
frequently  obtained,  which  being  soluble  in  potassic  hydrate,  would 
completely  spoil  the  result  for  carbon.  Nitrogenous  bodies  on  com- 
bustion frequently  give  off  a  portion  of  their  nitrogen  as  nitric  oxide, 
which,  when  mixed  with  air,  is  absorbed  by  potash,  and  would  also 
bring  the  result  too  high.  In  this  case  a  layer  of  a  mixture  of  potassic 
chromate  and  manganic  oxide  is  placed  in  the  front  part  of  the  com- 
bustion tube,  and  kept  very  gently  heated  during  the  combustion, 
whereby  all  nitrous  fuses  are  effectually  removed. 

13.  Much  saving  of  time,  together  with  simplification  of  mani- 
pulation and  greater  certainty  in  the  results  of  carbon  and  hydrogen 
estimation,  is  obtained  by  combustion  in  a  stream  of  oxygen  in  a 
tube  open  at  both  ends  (fig.  6).  Between  the  asbestos  plugs  d  and  e 
a  layer  of  granulated  cupric  oxide  is  placed ;  the  ends  of  the  tube  are 
closed  by  bored  corks,  in  one  of  which  is  placed  a  tube  for  the  intro- 
duction of  pure  air  or  oxygen,  whilst  the  other  serves  to  connect  with 
the  absorption  apparatus.  The  combustion  tube  is  heated  to  redness 
in  the  furnace,  whilst  a  stream  of  dry  air  is  passed  through ;  by  this 
means  the  whole  apparatus  and  its  contents  are  obtained  thoroughly 
dry  and  ready  for  immediate  use.  The  absorption  tubes  for  water  and 
carbonic  anhydride  having  been  attached,  the  weighed  substance  con- 
tained in  a  porcelain  or  platinum  boat  c  is  pushed  in  (volatile  liquids

in  bulbs  as  described),  and  finally  a  short  glass  rod  with  fused  edges 
b,  which  nearly  fills  the  tube.  The  object  of  this  latter  is  to  cause  an 
acceleration  of  the  gas  stream  at  that  point,  and  so  prevent  any  chance 
of  the  vapours  given  off  by  the  burning  body  travelling  backwards, 
as  they  might  otherwise  do,  the  stream  of  gas  being  necessarily  slow, 
to  ensure  complete  combustion.  The  whole  apparatus  shown  in 
fig.  7  being  arranged,  and  the  substance  in  its  boat  placed  behind 
the  red-hot  cupric  oxide,  heat  is  next  applied  at  the  place  where  the 
glass  rod  is  (b,  fig.  6)  and  then  slowly  advanced  to  the  boat.  At 
the  commencement  purified  air  may  be  employed,  the  oxidation  being 
mainly  effected  at  the  expense  of  the  cupric  oxide ;  later  oxygen  is 
turned  on  from  a  second  gas-holder,  and  the  complete  oxidation  of 
any  carbon  left  behind  is  then  effected ;  any  reduced  copper  is  also 
re-oxidised.  Both  air  and  oxygen  are  purified  by  passing  through 
potash  and  calcic  chloride  or  sulphuric  acid.  The  stream  of  oxygen  is 
continued  until  its  presence  can  be  distinctly  observed  at  the  absorption 
apparatus  ;  it  is  then  displaced  by  a  current  of  air.  The  cooled  absorp- 
tion tubes  and  the  boat,  if  any  ash  is  left,  are  then  weighed.  The 
combustion  tube  can  then  be  employed  for  a  fresh  analysis,  as  it  is  in  a 
state  of  complete  readiness,  i.e.  completely  free  from  water  and 
carbonic  anhydride  and  charged  with  pure  cupric  oxide.  In  the  case 
of  nitrogenous  bodies  potassic  chromate  and  manganic  dioxide  are 
placed  in  the  anterior  portion  of  the  tube.  With  substances  containing 
halogens  a  roll  of  silver  must  be  placed  in  front  of  the  cupric  oxide ; 
by  this  every  trace  of  halogen  is  absorbed.  Bodies  containing  sulphur 
must  be  burnt  with  plumbic  chromate,  or  if  cupric  oxide  and  oxygen 
be  used  the  gas  stream  must  be  passed  over  pure  plumbic  peroxide, 
heated  to  but  little  above  100°,  by#vhich  all  sulphurous  anhydride  is 
removed. 

Estimation  of  Nitrogen. 

14.  The  determination  of  the  amount  of  nitrogen  in  organic  bodies 
is  effected  either  by  measuring  the  nitrogen  in  the  free  state  and 
calculating  the  weight  fro  in  the  volume,  or  by  conversion  into  am- 
monia. 

The  first  method  can  be  applied  to  all  organic  bodies ;  the  second 
does  not  give  satisfactory  results  in  those  cases  where  the  nitrogen 
is  in  union  with  the  oxygen  of  the  organic  substance  (e.g.  in  nitro 
compounds). 

15.  Estimation  of  Xitrogen  by  Volume. — By  the  combustion  of 
nitrogenous  organic  bodies  with  cupric  oxide  there  results,  as  already 
mentioned,  carbonic  anhydride,  water,  and  nitrogen,  and  probably 
some  quantity  of  nitric  oxide,  this  latter  being  reduced  to  nitrogen 
by  passing  over  red-hot  metallic  copper.  On  cooling  the  products  of 
combustion,  the  water  is  separated  in  the  liquid  form  ;  the  carbonic 
anhydride  (and  also  any  sulphurous  anhydride  or  halogens)  is  readily 
absorbed  by  a  solution  of  an  alkaline  hydrate,  so  that  pure  nitrogen 
remains,  and  can  be  estimated  by  measurement.  The  single  difficulty 
of  this  method  is  the  complete  removal  from  the  apparatus  of  the 
indifferent  gases  of  the  air  before  the  commencement  of  the  combus- 
tion.    This  can  be  effected  by  complete  exhaustion  by  the  mercurial

air  jiuiiij),  or  more  simply  by  a  stream  of  carbonic  anhydride.  The 
procedure  is  as  follows  :  A  combustion  tube  (fig.  8\  about  one  metre 
long,  has  placed  in  it  next  to  its  closed  ends  about  30 grains  <»f  hydric 
sodic  carbonate  (oft),  then  a  layer  of  cupric  oxide  (ft«)j  then  the 
mixture  of  the  weighed  substance  and  cupric  oxide  (cd),a  layer  of 
cupric  oxide  (d e)  added,  and  the  reel  of  the  tube  filled  with  copper 
turnings  of  clean  metallic  surface  ;  a  gas  delivery  tube  is  then  attached 
by  means  of  a  perforated  cork.  The  tube  so  filled  (a  ft,  fig.  '.')  is  laid 
in  the  furnace,  united  to  the  bent  delivery  tube  {cf),  and  the  end  of 
the   latter   dipped  under   mercury.     One-half  of  the    hydric   sodic

r 


carbonate  is  then  heated  to  brisk  decomposition;  the  evolved  gases, 
carbonic  anhydride  and  water  vapour,  expel  the  air  contained  in  the 

apparatus,  which  escapes  in  bubbles  through  the  mercury.  Prom  time 
to  time  samples  of  the  escaping  gas  are  collected  in  a  test  tul>e  com- 
pletely filled  with  potash  solution  and  mercury  ;  when  such  a  sample 
is  absorbed  by  the  potash  without  leaving  any  residue,  it  is  certain 
that  the  air  has  been  completely  expelled.  A  measuring  tube  tilled 
with    mercury,  first   having  about  50-G0  cc.  of  concentrated  potash 


solution    run   up  into  it,  is  placed   over  the  end   of  the  delivery  tube 
and  the  Combustion  commenced.      The  cupric  oxide  at  <l  •■  and  I>  C,  and 

the  metallic  copper  at  e/(fig.  8),  are  heated  to  bright  redness,  and  the 
heating  gradually  carried  to  the  mixture  of  cupric  oxide  and  Biibetanee. 
\  oon  as  the  whole  tube  between  b  and/' is  red  hot  the  evolution  of 
gas  ceases.  All  the  organic  substance  is  then  burnt,  and  the  greater 
pari  of  the  products  of  combustion  collected  in  the  measuring  tube. 

The  remaining  portion  of  the  hydric  sodic  carbonate  is  then  heated,  in 

order  to  displace  any  nitrogen  remaining  in  the  tube.     After  some 

time,  when  the  complete  absorption  of  the  carbonic   anhvdiide  by  the 

potash  solution  is  quite  certain,  a  small  porcelain  capsule  is  placed 


10  INTRODUCTION. 

under  the  open  end  of  the  measuring  tube,  and  the  tube  and  contents 
removed  to  a  deep  cylinder  filled  with  distilled  water,  the  capsule 
being  then  removed.  The  mercury  and  potash  sink  out  of  the  tube 
and  are  replaced  by  water.  The  measuring  tube  is  now  sunk  so  far 
into  the  cylinder  that  the  surface  of  the  water  stands  at  the  same  level 
inside  and  outside  the  tube.  It  is  then  allowed  to  stand  until  both 
gas  and  water  have  acquired  the  temperature  of  the  room  ;  the  volume 
of  the  gas  in  cubic  centimetres  (v)  is  then  read  off  the  tube,  and  at  the 
same  time  the  temperature  (t  C.)  and  the  barometer  (b  in  mm.)  noted. 
The  weight  of  nitrogen  obtained  is  then,  with  correction  for  the  tension

16.  Estimation  of  Nitrogen  as  Ammonia. — As  already  explained, 
most  organic  bodies,  when  heated  with  alkaline  hydrates,  give  off  all 
their  nitrogen  as  ammonia,  The  analysis  is  usually  conducted  as 
follows  : — The  substance  to  be  analysed  is  mixed  with  five  to  six  times 
its  weight  of  soda  lime  in  a  warm  porcelain  mortar,  and  then  transferred 

Pto.  io. 


to  a  combustion  tube  which  has  already  been  drawn  out  to  an  oblique 
point  and  partly  tilled  with  soda  lime;  the  mortar  is  then  washed 
out  with  fresh  soda  lime  and  the  tube  nearly  filled  therewith,  a  plug 
of  asbestos  put  lightly  in,  and  a  bulb  apparatus  containing  hydro- 
chloric acid  fixed  on  by  means  of  a  well-fitting  cork.  The  tube  a 
(fig.  10)  is  then  heated  from  the  anterior  backwards.  Ammonia  is 
evolved,  which  is  absorbed  by  the  acid,  being  converted  into  amnionic 
chloride.  Free  hydrogen  and  hydrocarbons  are  generally  also  evolved, 
the  latter  colouring  the  liquid  in  the  bulb.  At  the  close  of  the  com- 
bustion, when  the  mass,  which  blackens  at  first,  must  have  become 
quite  white  again,  the  point  of  the  tube  is  broken  off  and  air  sucked 
through  in  order  to  bring  all  the  ammonia  into  the  bulb.  This  latter 
is  then  removed,  the  contents  emptied  into  a  porcelain  basin,  and  the 
bulb  rinsed  repeatedly  with  pure  water.  The  acid  and  wash  waters 
are  then  mixed  with  excess  of  platinic  chloride  and  the  whole  eva- 
porated to  dryness  on  the  water  bath.  The  residue  consists  of  am-

and  the  insoluble  amnionic  platinic  chloride  collected  on  a  dried  and 
weighed  filter,  completely  washed  with  ether  alcohol,   and  dried   at

Many  organic  substances,  when  heated  with  alkalies,  iri  \  <*  their 
nitrogen— at  least  in  part— not  as  ammonia  but  in  combination  with 
carton  and  hydrogen,  in  the  form  of  organic  bases,  whose  hydro- 
chlorides give  with  platinic  chloride  compounds  resembling  tin- 
amnionic  double  salt,  in  which  there  lb  still  out- atom  of  platinum  to 
two  of  nitrogen.  It  Is,  therefore,  advisable  always  not  only  t<>  weigh 
the  double  Bait,  but  also  the  platinum  Left  on  ignition,  the  nitre 
being  finally  calculated  from  the  latter. 

16A.  Instead  of  estimating  by  precipitating  as  above,  the  contents 
of  the  bulb  may  be  evaporated  to  dryness  and  the  chlorine  in  the 
residua]  amnionic  chloride  determined  by  addition  of  a  standard  solu- 
tion of  argentic  nitrate  ;  one  atom  of  nitrogen  must  have  been  present 
for  every  atom  of  chlorine  found. 

Estimation  of  the  Halogens. 

17.  In  all  cases  where  organic  halogen  compounds  are  not  <li 
decomposed  by  water  with  complete  conversion  of  the  halogen  into 
it^  hydro-acid  (as  happens  with  the  chlorine, bromine,  (fee., compounds 
of  the  organic  acid  radicals),  the  halogens  must  be  rendered  capable  of 
precipitation  with  argentic  nitrate  by  the  action  ofenerg  rents. 

This  can  frequently  be  accomplished  by  the  action  of  sodium 
amalgam  upon  an  aqueous  solution  of  the  organic  body,  e.g.  mono- 
chloracetic  acid  is  decomposed  according  to  the  equation  : 

C2H3C10,  +  Na,  =  C,H:5XaOJ  +  N(  I 

the  chlorine  being  then  readily  precipitated  from  the  sodic  chloride  by 
addition  of  silver  salts. 

In  cases  where  this  method  is  not  available  the  decomposition  can 
be  effected  by  heating  with  pure  Lime  in  a  combustion  tube.  The 
apparatus  is  quite  similar  to  thai  \\-<->\  in  estimating  nitrogen  as 
ammonia,  only  no  absorption  tube  is  required.  The  ignited  residue  is 
dissolved  in  nitric  acid,  precipitated  with  silver  solution,  the  silver 
salt  collected  on  a  filter,  washed,  ignited,  and  weighed.  As  in  this 
operation  a  Uu  -   of  lime   must    l>e  employed  a  considerable 

volume  of  liquid  is  obtained,  winch  makes  the  filtration  a  very  weari

Latterly    this    method    has    been     nearly    entirely    superseded     by 

another,  which  consists  in  the  complete  oxidation  of  the  organic  body 
by  nitric  acid  at  high  temperatures.  In  many  cases  this  reagent  can 
be  used  dilute  (1*2  L-3sp.gr.),  and  acts  complete^  even  a1  ISO  150  ; 
very  few  organic  bodies  can  resist  the  action  <>{'  fuming  nitric  acid  at 
l80°-200°.  The  employment  of  temperatures  so  much  above  the 
boiling  point  of  nitric  acid  necessitates  the  use  of  strong  walled,  sealed 
tubes,  in  order  to  resist  the  high  pressures  produced

enclosed,  together  with  excess  of  argentic  nitrate  and  of  moderately 
concentrated,  or  if  necessary  of  fuming,  nitric  acid,  in  a  strong  walled 
glass  tube,  care  being  taken  that  in  sealing  the  drawn-out  point  is 
well  thickened.  Fig.  11  shows  the  whole  apparatus.  The  glass  bulb 
is  now  broken  by  vigorous  shaking,  the  enclosed  substance 
Via.  11.  coming  in  contact  with  the  nitric  acid,  and  the  tube  is  then 
heated  for  several  hours  in  an  air  bath,  heated  to  the  neces- 
sary temperature.  The  air  bath  usually  employed  is  shown 
in  fig.  12;  it  contains  several  wrought -iron  tubes  closed  at 
one  end,  and  which  are  placed  in  an  inclined  position  in  the 
bath.  If  one  of  the  glass  tubes  explodes,  it  cannot  destroy 
the  other  tubes  being  heated  in  the  bath  at  the  same  time, 
nor  can  it  damage  the  operator. 

When  the  reaction  is  completed  the  apparatus  is  allowed 
to  cool,  the  glass  tube  carefully  removed,  wrapped  in  a 
cloth,  except  the  capillary  tube,  and  the  latter  softened  in  a 
flame.  The  internal  pressure  blows  the  point  out,  and  the 
strongly  compressed  gases  (carbonic  anhydride  and  reduction 
products  of  nitric  acid)  are  evolved  without  danger.  The 
glass  tube  is  then  cut  open,  the  contents  completely  washed 
into  a  beaker,  and  after  sufficient  dilution  of  the  nitric  acid, 
the  haloid  silver  salt,  and  the  fragments  of  the  glass  bulb 
collected  on  a  filter,  washed,  dried,  ignited,  and  weighed. 
By  subtraction  of  the  weight  of  the  filter,  ash,  and  glass 
bulb  the  weight  of  the  chloride,  bromide,  or  iodide  of  silver  is  obtained, 
from  which  the  weight  of  halogen  can  be  calculated. 


Estimation  of  Sulphur  and  Phosjrfwrus. 

18.  Many  sulphurised  organic  bodies  can  be  completely  oxidised 
by  nitric  acid,  with  conversion  of  their  sulphur  into  sulphuric  acid,  the 


Fin.  12. 


method  above  described  being  employed,  the  sulphuric  acid  being  pre- 
cipitated as  baric  sulphate  from  the  largely  diluted  oxidation  product. 
If  halogens  are  estimated  in  the  same  operation  the  filtrate  from  the 
silver  precipitate  must  be  treated  with  hydrochloric  acid,  so  as  to 
remove  all  silver  before  precipitating  the  sulphuric  acid. 


DETERMINATION   01?  THE  CHEMICAL  FORMUI  13 

If  the  substance  oxidised  by  nitric  acid  contained  phosphorus, 
arsenic,  or  metals,  fchey  will  be  converted  respectively  into  phosphoric 
acid,  arsenic  acid,  or  metallic  nitrates,  and  can  be  eetimat  d  according 
to  the  usual  methods  of  quantitative  analysis. 

Frequently  organic  sulphur  oompoundja  resist  the  action  of  nitric 
add,  so  that  their  decomposition  can  only  be  effected  by  fusion  with 
nitre  and  an  alkaline  carbonate.  The  mixture  must  be  made  in  such 
proportions  that  there  shall  be  no  explosion  on  heating.  Volatile 
substances  are  generally  partly  oxidised  in  a  sealed  glass  tube  by 
nitric  acid,  whereby  non-volatile  bodi<  s  are  formed  ;  the  add  liquid  is 
then  more  than  saturated  with  dry  alkaline  carbonate,  and  the  whole 
evaporated  to  dryness  and  fused  in  a  platinum  dish.  As  soon  as  all 
carbon  is  burnt,  and  the  mass  has  become  completely  white,  it  is 
allowed  to  cool,  dissolved  in  water,  and  the  sulphuric  acid  pre- 
cipitated.

19.  Oxygen  is  usually  estimated  indirectly  ;  the  sum  of  the  percent- 
ages of  the  other  elements  present  is  deducted  from  one  hundred,  and 
the  difference  taken  as  oxygen.  For  instance,  the  combustion  of  03 
gram  of  cane  Bugar,  which  contains  carbon,  hydrogen,  and  oxygen  only, 
gave  0*463  gram  carbonic  anhydride  and  0-170  gram  water.  This, 
calculated  into  percentages,  gives —

Determination  op  the  Chemical  Formula  of  Organic  Compounds. 

20.  The  results  of  the  elementary  analysis  of  an  organic  body 
are  always  expressed  in  percentages;  from  these  empirical  formulae  can 
be  obtained  by  dividing  the  percentage  number  by  the  atomic  weight 
of  the  element  to  which  it  refers,  the  quotients  then  expressing  the 
proportions  in  which  the  ;it<»m>  of  carbon,  hydrogen,  oxygen,  (fee., 
united  to  each  other.  These  quotients,  generally  consisting  of 
fractions,  are  reduced  to  the  nearest  round  numbers,  and  then  re- 
present the  empirical  formula  of  the  body. 

In   chemical   analysis,    as  generally    in    any    operation    involving 
measuring  or  weighing,  there  are  slight  deviations   from  accuracy.       A 

formula  so  obtained  La  still  admissible,  although  the  percentage 
numbers  calculated  from  it  do  not  quite  agree  with  those  found  in  the 

investigation,  provided  that  the  deviation  does  not  exceed  a  certain 
limit.  This  limit  of  error  is  found  to  be  about  0*8  |„r  cent,  for 
carbon  and  0*2  percent,  for  hydrogen  ;  for  instance,  in  the  combustion 
of  pure  glacial  acetic  acid  the  following  numb  rs  were  obtained  : — ■

Determination  of  the  Molecular  Formula. 

21.  The  chemical  formula  of  a  body  must  be  something  more  than 
the  mere  expression  of  its  percentage  composition,  it  should  in  ad- 
dition express  the  atomic  composition  of  the  smallest,  relatively,  exist- 
ing quantity  of  the  body,  its  molecule.  It  is  evident  that  the  latter 
can  be  any  whole  multiple  of  the  empirical  formula ;  the  acetic  acid 
molecule  may  probably  be  C2H402,  C3H603,  kc. 

■  In  order,  therefore,  to  find  the  true  chemical  formula  of  a  body, 
in  addition  to  the  percentage  composition  there  must  also  be  deter- 
mined the  relative  weight  of  its  molecule,  either  from  certain  physical 
qualities,  especially  the  vapour  density  (see  further  on),  or  from  the 
products  derived  from  it  by  chemical  changes. 

Of  these  latter  '  derivatives '  the  most  important  for  acids  and 
bases  are  their  salts ;  for  indifferent  bodies,  especially  those  that  con- 
tain only  carbon  and  hydrogen,  their  haloid  substitution  products,  i.e. 
derivatives  in  which  the  hydrogen  is  replaced  by  a  halogen. 

22.  When  acetic  acid,  for  instance,  is  converted  into  its  silver  salt 
by  boiling  with  argentic  oxide,  and  the  salt  then  submitted  to 
analysis,  it  gives  the  following  percentage  composition  : —

sugar,  lactic  acid,  Arc.  The  analysis  of  derivatives  of  these  bodies, 
however,  leads  to  completely  different  molecular  formula. 

The  silver  salt  of  lactic  acid,  e.g.,  gives  this  latter  the  formula 
C8H603,  as  it  contains  three  atoms  each  of  carbon  and  oxygen  and 
five  atoms  of  hydrogen  to  one  atom  of  silver.

On  subtracting  HC1  from  this  we  get  for  creatinine  itself  C4H7N30,

24.  As  the  so-called  indifferent  bodies — i.e.  such  as  are  neither  of 
acid  nor  basic  nature — do  not  enter  into  combination,  it  is  necessary,  in 
determining  their  molecular  weight,  to  have  recourse  either  to  split- 
ting up — i.e.  decomposition  into  several  other  compounds  of  known 
molecular  formulae,  whose  relative  quantities  are  then  determined — or 
to  substitution. 

The  analysis  of  acetic  ether,  e.g.,  gives  as  its  empirical  formula 
C2H40  ;  by  treatment  with  potash  solution,  however,  it  splits  up 
into  equal  molecules  of  ethyl  alcohol,  C2H60,  and  potassic  acetate, 
C2H3K02.  It  is  therefore  seen  that  the  above  expression  must 
be  doubled  in  order  to  get  four  carbon  atoms.  The  decomposition  is 
then  represented  by  the  equation  : 

C4H8024-KOH  =  C2H60  +  C2H3K02. 

25.  The  simplest  formula  derivable  from  the  analysis  of  benzene 
is  CH.  A  crystalline  compound  of  benzene  and  chlorine  appears  to 
confirm  this,  as  its  investigation  leads  to  the  formula  CHC1. 
When  heated  with  alcoholic  potash,  however,  it  is  converted  into  an 
oil,  which  to  one  chlorine  atom  contains  two  carbon  and  one  hydrogen 
atoms. 

From  this  the  benzene  formula  would  be  C2H2,  the  chlorine 
compound  C2H2C12,  the  decomposition  product  C2HC1.  By  the 
investigation  of  other  products  of  the  action  of  chlorine  upon  benzene, 
C2H2  proves  not  to  be  its  formula.  One  of  these  bodies  contains  three 
carbon  atoms  to  one  chlorine  atom  =  C3H2C1.  The  composition  of 
another  corresponds  to  C3HC12.  Already  these  derivatives  with 
both  two  and  three  carbon  atoms  require  the  presence  of  C6  in  the 
molecule,  and  apart  from  that  other  substitution  products  exist  that 
cannot  be  otherwise  formulated. 

From  the  empirical  formula  of  the  chlorine  derivatives  the 
following  series  of  molecular  formulae  of  benzene  derivatives  is 
obtained : —

DETERMINATION  OF  VAPOUB    DENSITY.  17 

Derivation  of  tit <■  Moleoulcvr  Weight  from  the  Vapour  Density. 

26.   The  fact  that  in  the  union  of  gases  the  volumes  stand  iii   V< 

simple  relation  to  each  other  and  to  the  volume  of  their  gaseous  ©  m 

pound,  led  .-it  the  beginning  of  this  century  to  the  view  thai  equal 
volumes  of  different  gases  and  vapours  contain,  under  like  condition-  of 
temperature  and  pressure,  an  equal  number  of  molecules.  This  has 
since  been  amply  confirmed,  and  now  forms  one  of  the  mosl  important 

fundamental  laws  of  physical  chemistry. 

The  weights  of  equal    volumes   of  different  under    like 

temperature  and  pressure  (the  gas  and  vapour  densities),  express 
directly  the  relative  weights  of  the  molecules.  The  molecular  weight 
of  any  gaseous  or  volatile  (without  decomposition)  body  is  found  by 
multiplying  the  experimentally  determined  density  on  the  air  scale 
(i.e.  air  =  1)  by  28*92— i.e.  the  molecular  weight  is  28*92  tin- 
great  as  the  density  of  the  gas  or  vapour  on  the  air  Male.

Relatively  small  errors  in  the  determination  of  the  vapour  density 
would  lead  to  not  inconsiderable  deviations  in  the  molecular  weight 
obtained  by  this  method;  but  as  the  molecular  weight  musi  be  ■ 
whole  multiple  of  the  empirical  formula,  the  results  are  quite  suffi- 
ciently near  to  leave  no  doubt  as  to  which  multiple  is  the  correct  one. 

Determination  of  Vapour  Densit !y. 

27.  The  density  of  a  gas  or  vapour  is  the  quotient  of  s  given 
volume  thereof  divided  by  the  weight  of  an  equal  volume  of  atmo- 
spheric air  at  the  same  temperature  and  pressure.  As  a  cubic  centi-

ture /  and  pressure  b  of  the  gaseous  or    \  apouri-ahle  body.      There  are 

two  different  methods  employed  for  this  purpose :  either  the  amount 

required  to  till  B   flask  of  known  capacity  at  a   known  temperature  ;md 

pressure  is  weighed,  or  the  volume  occupied  by  s  known  weight  of  the 
vapour  is  meaaun  d. 

28.  In  order  to  estimate  the  density  according  to  the  first  principle, 

a  glass  balloon  of  about  300  500  vr.  capacity  i->  employed  ;  the  neck 

is  drawn  out  to  a    long   canillarv   tube,  and    Bent  at   an   obtUM    angle.

INTRODUCTION. 


Fig.  13. 


The  flask  is  dried  by  repeated  exhaustion  and  admission  of  dried 
air,  and  then  weighed  full  of  dry  air,  the  temperature  t  and  pressure 
b  being  noted.  About  5-10  grin,  of  the  liquid  under  examination  is 
introduced  into  the  slightly  warmed  balloon,  which  is  then  placed  in 

an  oil  bath,  heated  to  a  few  degrees 
above  the  boiling  point  of  the  sub- 
stance, as  shown  in  fig.  13.  The 
thermometer  must  be  so  placed  in 
the  oil  that  its  bul  b  is  as  high  as  the 
middle  of  the  balloon  and  as  near 
as  possible  to  it.  The  air  is  expelled 
by  the  vapour  formed,  the  excess  of 
the  latter  also  escaping.  When  this 
ceases  the  temperature  is  raised  about 
20°-30°  ;  the  portion  of  the  capillary 
tube  projecting  above  the  oil  being 
also  heated,  to  volatilise  any  liquid 
condensed  there;  the  point  fused  in 
the  blowpipe  flame,  the  temperature 
t,  and  the  pressure  b  being  noted  at 
the  same  time.  The  balloon  is  now 
removed  from  the  oil  bath,  carefully 
cleaned,  and  when  cold  weighed. 
The  next  point  is  to  ascertain  the 
capacity  of  the  balloon  and  the 
volume  of  any  air  left  in  it.  The 
point  is,  therefore,  broken  off  under  mercury,  whereupon  the  balloon 
tills  with  the  metal.  If  a  gas  bubble  of  sufficient  size  to  affect  the 
result  is  visible,  it  is  transferred  to  a  graduated  tube  placed  over 
mercury,  and  its  volume  and  weight  determined,  calculated  also  to 
the  temperature  of  the  bath  and  pressure  at  the  time  of  fusing,  and 
both  numbers  used  for  the  correction  of  the  weight  and  volume  of  the 
vapour. 

The  balloon,  after  completely  filling  with  mercury,  is  then  emptied 
into  a  graduated  vessel,  in  order  to  determine  its  capacity  at  the 
ordinary  temperature.  The  following  data  for  the  calculation  of  the 
vapour  density  are  now  obtained  : — 

r  weight  in   grammes  of  the  balloon  filled  with  ah-  at  the 

temperature  t  and  the  pressure  b. 
p'  weight  in  grammes  of  the  balloon  filled  with  vapour  at  the 

temperature  t'  and  the  pressure  bf. 
v  capacity  of  the  balloon  at  the  temperature  t. 

From  these  the  weight  p  of  the  atmospheric  air  in  the  balloon  at  t* 
and  6  mm.  pressure  is  thus  calculated. 

p  =0012932  v.^^-^o 

The  weight  of  the  glass  of  the  balloon  is  p  —  p,  that  of  the  vapour 
therefore  p'  —  (p  —  p). 

The  glass  expands  on  heating;  therefore  the  capacity  v'  of  the

29.  Two  important  methods  based  upon  the  second  principle  are 
now  in  use — viz.  the  methods  of  Hoffmann  and  Victor  Meyer,  which 
are  based  upon  the  method  of  Gay-Lussac,  now  seldom  used. 

Hoffmann's  method  is  applicable  to  bodies  whose  boiling  point 
is  considerably  below  100°  C,  and  whose  vapours  already  follow  the 
laws  of  Marriotte  and  Gay-Lussac  at  the  boiling  point  of  water. 
This  excellent  method  may  also  be  used  for  the  vapour  density  'de- 
termination of  less  volatile  bodies,  as  by  the  employment  of  a  torri- 
cellian  vacuum  accurate  measurements  of  the  volumes  may  be  made 
at  a  much  lower  temperature  than  the  body's  actual  boiling  point 
under  atmospheric  pressure. 

A  graduated  barometer  tube  about  1  metre  long  a  (fig.  14)  is 
completely  filled  with  dry  mercury  and  inverted  in  a  vessel  full  of 
mercury.  The  tube  is  then  surrounded  by  a  wider  tube  b,  fitted 
tightly  to  it  by  the  cork  c.  At  the  upper  end  of  this  surrounding 
tube  a  tube  d  is  fitted  for  the  entrance  of  vapour,  whilst  an  exit  tube, 
united  to  a  condenser,  La  attached  to  its  lower  end. 

A  small  bottle  of  1  cc,  or  less,  content,  provided  with  a  glass 
stopper,  is  completely  filled  with  the  substance  under  investigation, 
and  the  weight  p  of  the  contents  determined  by  weighing.  The  bottle 
is  then  sent  up  the  barometer  tube,  when  the  stoppei  is  generally 
expelled  by  the  excess  of  interior  pressure.  A  good  stream  of  the 
vapour  of  some  substance  of  known  boiling  point  is  then  passed 
through  the  annular  space  between  the  cylinder  and  measuring  tube, 
by  which  the  latter  and  its  contents  are  soon  raised  to  a  like  tempe- 
rature.. 

The  substances  generally  used  in  the  vapour  bath  are  water  for  the 

more  volatile  and  aniline  for  the  Less  volatile    bodi 

The  liquid  contained  in  the  bottle  is  converted  into  vapour,  de- 
pressing the  mercurial  column.  As  soon  as  this  has  reached  a  oonstanl 
position  in  the  measuring  tube  the  volume  of  vapour  \  is  read  off, 
together  with  the  atmospheric  barometric  pressure  b,  the  height   n  oi' 

the  mercurial  column    inside  the  measuring  tube  and  the  boiling  point 

of  the  liquid  used  for  the  vapour  bath  being  also  noted.  When 
aniline  or  other  high-boiling  liquids  have  been  employed,  the  pressure 
on  the  vapour  at  the  temperature  t  is  not  simply  =  n  —  h,  the 
interior  mercurial  column  being  considerably  heated  and  its  ^p.  gr.

thereby  diminished.  The  height  must  therefore  be  calculated  to  the 
temperature  t'  of  the  exterior  air ;  this  may  be  accomplished  approxi- 
mately by  the  formula 

h;  =  h  [i  -  -00018  (t  -  t!y\ 

A   correction  must   also  be  made  for  the  tension  of  the  mercurial

30.  A  more  recent  method,  that  of  Victor  Meyer,  allows  of  the 
density  of  bodies  being  very  accurately  determined  within  very  wide 
ranges  of  temperature. 

The  principle  of  the  process  is  similar  to  that  of  Hoffmann's,  and 
consists  in  comparing  the  weight  of 
an  equal  volume  of  air  with  that  of 
the  substance  in  the  gaseous  state. 

The  apparatus  employed  is  shown 
in  fig.  15. 

The  bulb  a  of  the  vapourisation 
tube  a  is  immersed  in  a  cylindrical 
vessel  containing  a  liquid  to  serve  as 
bath ;  this  latter  is  heated  until  a  con-  / 
stant  temperature  is  attained,  when 
the  substance — about  1  grm. — pre- 
viously weighed  in  the  small  tube  e, 
10  to  20  mm.  long  and  2  to  4  wide, 
and  lightly  held  on  the  bent  wire  g 
passing  through  the  cork  of  the  a 
vapourisation  tube  (shown  on  an 
enlarged  scale  at  B,  fig.  15),  is  al- 
lowed to  fall  to  the  bottom  of  the 

wide  portion  by  slightly  rotating  the  wire.  As  soon  as  the  substance 
arrives  at  the  heated  portion  of  the  tube,  it  passes  into  the  vaporous 
state,  and  expels  an  equal  volume  of  ah"  by  the  side  tube  cZ,  which  is 
received  in  a  measuring  tube  over  water,  and  its  amount  read  off, 
temperature  and  pressure  being  noted. 

The  temperature  in  the  vapourisation  tube  need  not  be  accurately 
known,  only  that  it  be  sufficiently  high  for  the  whole  of  the  substance 
to  be  in  a  gaseous  state. 

For  very  high  temperatures  the  wide  portion  of  the  vapourisation 
tube  must  be  of  platinum  or  porcelain,  and  the  bath,  instead  of  water, 
aniline,  &c,  may  be  melted  lead,  or  for  the  highest  temperatures  a 
small  reverberatory  gas  furnace.

Rational  Formulae  and   Organic  Radicals. 

31.  The  molecular  formula  of  an  organic  compound  shows 
which  elements  and  what  number  of  atoms  of  each  are  contained  in 
the  molecule,  without  expressing  the  order  and  method  of  their  union. 

The  study  of  chemical  changes  shows  that  in  the  greater  number 
of  organic  molecules,  atoms  of  any  ingredient  elements  can  be 
replaced — singly  or  in  groups — with  differing  ease,  by  other  element- 
al} atoms,  or  eliminated  without  replacement,  and  that  they  must 
be  united  with  varying  degrees  of  firmness.  In  order  to  express  this 
fact  in  the  formula,  the  symbols  of  the  respective  elements  are  not 
written  once  only,  but  repeated  as  frequently  as  may  be  required  to 
indicate  the  varying  degrees  of  firmness  of  union.  The  number  of 
atoms  in  each  particular  form  of  union  are  expressed  in  the  usual 
manner.  Formulae  modified  in  this  way  are  termed  rati 
formulas. 

In  such  rational  formulas  there  must  evidently  exist  some  groups 
of  atoms  which  suffer  no  change  during  a  given  reaction  ;  such  an 
unattacked  residue  or  constituent  common  to  both  the  original  and 
derived  body  is  termed  a  radical,  and  when  it  contains  carbon  it  is 
termed  an  organic  radical  or  residue. 

An  example  will  easily  demonstrate  these  statements.  Ordinary 
(ethylic)  alcohol  whose  formula  is 

C2H60 

gives  up  one  of  its  six  hydrogen  atoms  when  treated  with  sodium, 
being  thereby  converted  into  the  body  C,H5NaO.  In  this  reaction 
the  group  C.2H50  remains  unchanged,  and  is  therefore  the  radical 
of  ethylic  alcohol,  and  the  rational  formula  would  be 

C2H5O.H. 

This  body  is,  however,  capable  of  further  changes;  by  treatment  with 
ozone  or  with  easily  reducible  bodies,  it  loses  two  hydrogen  atoms, 
without  replacement,  being  converted  into  aldehyde,  CtH40,  which 
can  further  take  up  an  additional  atom  of  oxygen,  yielding  acetic 
acid.     From  this  the  rational  formula  of  alcohol  is 

C2H4O.H2, 

in  which  the  group  C2H40  appears  as  the  radical. 

By  numerous  decompositions  groups  of  different  elementary  atoms 
are  simultaneously  removed  from  the  original  compound.  By  the 
action  of  hydrochloric  acid,  alcohol  is  changed  into  the  body  C2H5C1 
and  water,  having  its  oxygen  atom,  together  with  one  of  the  hydrogen 
atoms,  removed,  and  only  a  single  chlorine  atom  entering  in  their 
place.     This  reaction  leads  to  the  formula 

C2H5.OH, 

in  which  the  organic  radical  C0H5  (ethvl)  is  united  to  the  inorganic 
radical  OH  (hydroxy!). 


RATIONAL  FORMULAE.  23 

An  organic  compound  can  have  in  this  w&y  different  rational 
formulas,  corresponding  to  the  different  methods  in  which  it  Buffers 
decomposition.  Eational  formulae  of  such  a  kind  are  only  reaction  or 
decomposition  formulas. 

Both  the  reaction  formulae  for  ethylic  alcohol,  C2H5.OH  and 
C2H5O.H,  can  be  united  into  the  single  formula 

C2H5.O.H, 

from  the  fact  that  the  atom  of  hydrogen  replaced  by  sodium,  is  no 
other  than  the  one  which  is  expelled  simultaneously  with  oxygen  by 
action  of  hydrochloric  acid. 

C2H5.O.H  +  Na  =  C2H5.O.Na  +  H 
C2H5.O.H  +  HC1  =  C2H5.C1  +HOH. 

By  this  the  united  rational  reaction-formulae  obtain  a  further 
significance.  The  actual  connection  of  this  hydrogen  atom  to  the 
oxygen  atom  can  only  be  that  both  are  united  together,  that  the 
monad  H  is  united  to  the  organic  residue  C2H5  by  means  of  the 
dyad  0.  The  rational  formula  C2H5.O.H  expresses  the  order  of  com- 
bination of  at  least  two  atoms  in  the  alcohol  molecule,  as  well  as 
certain  decomposition  possibilities,  and  becomes  therefore  a  constitu- 
tional formula. 

Similarly  to  the  oxygen  and  one  hydrogen  atom  of  the  ethylic 
alcohol,  the  method  of  union  of  the  elements  composing  the  radical 
C2H5  may  be  settled  by  the  study  of  reactions  of  greater  extent,  not 
alone  by  decomposition  processes,  but  also  by  the  reverse — synthesis, 
the  building  up  of  the  organic  compound  from  simpler  bodies,  or  even 
from  its  constituent  elements. 

Alcohol,  as  already  mentioned,  is  converted  by  oxidation  into 
acetic  acid,  C2H402.  In  this,  by  treatment  with  phosphoric  chloride, 
one  hydrogen  and  one  oxygen  atom  are  replaced  by  one  chlorine 
atom,  the  body  C2H30C1  being  formed.  Acetic  acid  has,  therefore, 
the  hydrate  formula  C2H3O.OH.  If  its  sodic  salt  C2H3O.ONa  be 
submitted  to  diy  distillation  with  sodic  hydrate,  JSaOH,  a  residue 
of  sodic  carbonate,  is  left,  and  marsh  gas,  CH4,  is  evolved.  Accord- 
ing to  the  equation  : 

C2H3O.ONa  +  NaOH  =  C03Na2  +  CH4 
the  sodic  carbonate  obtaining  C02Na,   the  marsh  gas  0H3,  from  the 
sodic  acetate.     The  reaction  is  expressed  completely  in  accordance  with 
the  facts  by  the  rational  formulae  : 

CH3-CO.ONa  +  HONa  =  CH3H  +  CO.ONa.ONa. 

From  this  it  is  highly  probable  that  in  acetic  acid  three  hydrogen 
atoms  are  united  to  one  carbon  atom,  the  two  oxygen  atoms,  and  by 
means  of  one  of  them  the  fourth  hydrogen  atom,  to  the  other  carbon 
atom.     Numerous  other  reactions  lead  to  the  same  conclusion. 

The  detailed  constitutional  formula  obtained  for  acetic!  acid  in  this 
way,  leads  to  the  further  conclusion  that  in  ethyl  alcohol  also  the 
same  group,  CH3,  must  occur,  and  makes  il  probable  that  the  con- 
stitutional formula  is  CH3.CH2.OH.  Complete  continuation  of 
this  view  is  obtained  in  the  synthesis  of  ethyl  alcohol  from  marshgaB. 
On  exposing  a  mixture  of  this  gas  and  chlorine  to  diffused  daylight, 


24  INTRODUCTION. 

there  results,  with  elimination  of  one  of  the  four  hydrogen  atoms,  the 
the  body  CH3C1,  methylic  chloride  : 

CH4  +  Cl2  =  CH3CI  +  HC1, 
which  by  heating  with  potassic  cyanide  yields  potassic  chloride  and 
methylic  cyanide : 

CH3CI  +  KCN  =  KC1  +  CH3.CN. 
Nascent  hydrogen  converts  the  latter  into  ethylamine : 

CH3.CN  +  4H  =  CH3.CH2.NH2, 
in  which,  by  action  of  nitrous  acid,  the  amide  group  NH2  may  be 
replaced  by  hydroxyl,  OH  : 

CH3.CH2.NH2  +  NO.OH  =  H20  +  N2  +  CH3.CH2.OH, 

the  product  obtained  being  ethylic  alcohol. 

The  constitutional  formula  obtained  in  this  way  not  only  makes 
clear  all  the  known  reactions  of  alcohol,  but  shows  at  the  same  time 
in  what  order  the  component  atoms  must  be  united  amongst  them- 
selves, or,  in  other  words,  it  expresses  the  constitution  of  the  com- 
pound radicals  of  the  less  detailed  rational  formula.  Therewith  it 
helps  to  a  large  extent  to  the  solution  of  one  of  the  most  important 
questions  of  chemical  knowledge — from  the  nature  and  position  of  the 
component  elementary  atoms  to  determine  the  properties  of  a  com- 
pound. 

Constitutional  formulae  which  show  in  this  way  the  relative 
positions  of  all  the  atoms  in  the  molecule  of  a  compound  are  termed 
structural  formulas.  They  are  based  upon  the  intrinsic  presuppo- 
sition of  the  valency  of  the  chemical  elements. 

Outlines  of  the  Chemical  Structure  of  Organic  Bodies. 

32.  The  groundwork  of  every  organic  molecule  is  the  tetrad 
carbon  atom. 

By  the  saturation  alone  of  the  four  bonds  of  a  single  carbon  atom 
by  all  possible  other  mono-  or  polyvalent  elementary  atoms,  a  very 
large  number  of  organic  compounds  will  result,  which  are  known  as 
the  mono-carbonides.  We  know  that  nearly  all  elementary  atoms 
are  able  to  combine  not  only  with  those  of  other  elements,  but  also  to 
unite  amongst  themselves.  Monad  elements  form  their  free  mole- 
cules in  this  way,  which  in  the  undecomposed  state  are  incapable  of 
further  direct  combination  :  e.g.  H — H  hydrogen  gas,  CI — CI  chlorine 
gas. 

On  the  other  hand,  when  two  atoms  of  a  polyvalent  element  unite 
with  each  other,  it  may  be  by  employment  of  their  total  attraction 
possibilities,  e.g. 

0=0  oxygen  gas, 

or  only  a  part  of  it  is  employed  for  this  purpose,  whilst  the  other  parts 
are  available  for  union  with  other  elements,  e.g. 
H — 0 — 0 — H  hydric  peroxide. 

The  higher  the  valency  of  an  elementary  atom,  the  more  complicated 
and  various  will  be  its  capability  of  uniting  with  other  atoms  of  the 
same  or  other  elements. 

If  two  carbon  atoms  (in  the  dicarbonides)  coalesce  with  employ-

ment  of  only  one  bond  each,  there  remains  to  each  atom   three — 
together  six — bonds  disposable  for  nnion  with  other  atoms,  e.g.

by  trivalent  union,  each  only  one —

33.  The  number  of  carbon  atoms  directly  united  to  one  molecule 
can  proceed  far  beyond  two.  There  are  carbon  groups  or  '  carbon 
nuclei '  which  contain  three  (tricarbonides),  four  (tetracarbonides),  five 
(pentacarbonides),  and  so  on  up  to  thirty  or  more  carbon  atoms,  com- 
bined together.  This,  therefore,  comes  to  the  fact  that  a  carbon  atom 
may  be  united  to  several  others  with  only  partial  saturation  of  their 
bonds.  In  this  relation  the  union  of  a  carbon  atom  with  only  one  other 
is  distinguished  as  union  of  the  first  order,  or  primary  union,  which 
may  be  mono-,  di-,  or  trivalent.  The  combination  of  an  atom  with 
two  others  forms  a  union  of  the  second  order,  or  secondary  union —

Finally,  a  carbon  atom  can  be  in  combination  with  four   others,

This  requires  a  nucleus  of  at  least  five  carbon  atoms.

carbon  atoms  only,  it  forms  a  simple  open,  so-called  normal  chain —

Primarily  united  carbon  atoms  can  only  occur  at  the  end  of  chains ; 
they  are  '  terminal,'  all  others  being  '  intermediate.' 

If  the  terminal  carbon  atoms  of  a  simple  open  chain  also  unite 
with  one  another  so  that  the  primary  combination  is  completely  lost, 
there  results  closed  chains  or  carbon  rings,  e.g.

in  a  molecule,  the  greater  the  number  of  carbon  chains  become. 
Whilst  by  only  monovalvent  combination  two  carbon  atoms  can  form

;t  total  of  ten,  and  so  on  in  rapidly  increasing  progression. 

The  number  of  possible  modifications  of  nuclei  grows  also  consider- 
ably by  the  introduction  of  di-  or  trivalent  union  of  the  carbon  atoms. 
In  cases,  therefore,  where  all  the  bonds  not  employed  in  nucleus 
building  are  saturated  by  atoms  of  one  and  the  Bame  element,  e.g. 
hydrogen,  a  very  considerable  number  of  organic  bodies  may  exist 
having  the  same  content  of  hydrogen  and  carbon  atoms,  but  entirely 
differing  properties,  owing  to  the  difference  of  their  nuclei  (isomeric 
compounds;  see  §  46). 

36.  To  a  polyvalent  nucleus  (as  to  i  polyvalent  element)  atoms 
of  several  different  elements  can  be  attached  ;  the  number  of  possible 
organic  compounds  is  therefore  enormous.

are  formed  as

may  be  either  with  their  whole  valency,  e.g.

If  the  latter  be  not  carbon,  compounds  of  carbon  nuclei  with  inorganic 
radicals  will  result  (such  as  above  with  hydroxyl,  HO — ,  amidogen,

of  its  valency  to  one  carbon  nucleus,  and  with  the  remainder  to  other 
carbon  nuclei.  Dyad  elements  can  unite  in  this  way  with  two  carbon 
nuclei,  e.g.

elements,  if  there  be  several  atoms  of  the  same  element  attached  to  a

39.  Chemical  Position. — The  nature  of  the  compound  of  one  ami 
the  same  carbon  nucleus  with  several  other  elements  at  the  same 
time,  depends  not  only  on  the  relative  number,  but  in  many  cases  on 
their  position  relatively  to  the  individual  carbon  atomfl  <>t"  the  nucleus. 

If  a  dicarbonide  nucleus  is  united  to  only  a  single  other  elementary 
atom  besides  hydrogen  atoms,  it  is  quite  indifferent  to  which  of  the 
two  carbon  atoms  it  is  attached.

So  soon,  however,  as,  by  increase  in  the  number  of  carbon  atoms, 
the  method  of  union  of  the  individual  carbon  atoms  differ,  the  order

If  a  dicarbonide  group  has  attached  to  it,  besides  hydrogen  atoms, 
at  least  two  other  elementary  atoms,  or  radicals,  the  order  of  dis-

VALENCY  OF  THE  CAEI30N   NUCLEUS.  31 

40.  Valency  of  the  Carbon  Nucleus. — The  valency  or  saturation 
capability  of  a  carbon  nucleus  with  which  it  unites  to  other  elements, 
is  expressed  by  the  difference  between  the  sum  of  the  valency  of  the 
carbon  atoms  composing  it,  and  the  valency  employed  in  their  mutual 
union. 

If  the  union  is  in  the  simplest  way — i.e.  if  n  carbon  atoms  with  a 
total  of  4  n  bonds  combine  to  an  open  chain,  with  mutual  monovalent 
union  only — there  are  then  n  —  1  bonds  left,  of  which  each  corresponds 
to  two  attraction  units.     The  valency  of  the  nucleus  is  therefore 

4n-2(w-l)  =  2M  +  2, 

whether  the  chain  is  single  or  has  side  chains. 

Another  kind  of  consideration  leads  to  the  same  result.  In  the 
simple  open  chain  of  n  C  there  are  two  terminal  carbon  atoms,  each 
with  three,  n  —  2,  intermediate  atoms  with  two  each,  in  sum  a  valency 
of  2. 3  +  2  (rc- 2)  =6  +  2^-4  =  2^  +  2  for  attachment  to  other 
elements.  The  entry  of  side  chains  does  not  affect  the  result,  because, 
though  satisfying  one  valency  of  an  intermediate  carbon  atom,  its  own 
terminal  carbon  atom,  having  a  valency  of  three,  makes  the  total  ad- 
ditional valency  2  n' ;  e.g.  for  the  different  pentacarbonide  nuclei  with 
only  monovalent  union —

32  INTRODUCTION. 

of  available  bonds  decreasing  by  two.  In  open  chains,  and  where 
the  divalent  union  occurs  but  once,  the  valency  of  the  nucleus 
is  2  n  +  2  —  2  =  2n,  when  the  divalent  union  occurs  twice,  2 n  +  2 
—  2 .  2  •=  2  n  —  2,  Ac 

From  the  same  gixmnds,  with  bivalent  union  of  neighbouring 
carbon  atoms  of  the  2  n  +  2  bonds  originally  available,  four  are  used 
up,  making  the  valency  of  the  nucleus  2»  -  2. 

Where  by  the  union  of  two  terminal  carbon  atoms  a  closed  chain 
is  formed,  and  the  union  is  monovalent,  two  bonds  are  employed.  If 
there  results  a  single  ring  without  side  chains,  and  in  which  the 
union  between  the  carbon  atoms  is  monovalent  only,  the  valency  of 
the  nucleus  will  be  2  n. 

According  to  these  principles  the  valency  of  every  nucleus  of 
known  structure  is  easily  determined,  even  though  it  contains  many 
varieties  of  combination ;  e.g.  for  the  nucleus  containing  eight  carbon 
atoms

The  valency  can  be  easily  calculated  as  follows  : —

The  closing  of  the  ring  diminishes  it  by    .  2

There  remains

or  for  all  nuclei  of  similar  structure  and  n  carbon  atoms  2  n  —  6  as  the 
valency. 

41.  Valency  of  Compound  Organic  Radicals. — The  valency  of  an 
organic  radical  (the  constituent  common  to  both  original  substance 
and  final  product  of  a  reaction)  depends  on  the  valency  of  the  carbon 
nucleus  and  on  the  number  of  atoms  attached  thereto,  and  equals  the 
difference  between  these  two.  If,  for  example,  an  open  chain  of 
monovalent  union,  and  whose  valency  therefore  is  2  n  +  2,  has  united 
to  it  2  n  +  1  hydrogen  atoms,  there  remains  a  single  carbon  bond  to 
unite  with  other  elements. 

2n+2-(2»+l)=I. 

Eadicals  of  the  general  formula  CnH2n+1  are  therefore  monovalent, 
those  of  the  composition  CnH2n  divalent,  <fcc 

If  a  compound  radical  contains  united  to  its  carbon  nucleus  not 
only  monad  elements,  but  also  polyad  elements,  the  method  of  union 
of  the  latter  can  often  be  settled  by  the  empirically  ascertained  valency 
of  the  radical. 

In  the  reactions  of  acetic  acid,  for  example,  the  group  C2H30 
frequently  passes  unchanged  as  a  radical  into  the  new  compound,  and 


SATURATED   AND   UNSATURATED   COMPOUNDS. 


33 


is  then  always  monovalent.  As  the  C2  nucleus  is  hexavalent,  the 
monovalent  radical  C2H30  must  have  the  oxygen  united  to  carbon 
with  both  it3  bonds. 

42.  Saturated  and  Unsaturated  Organic  Compounds.— In  cases 
where  di-  and  trivalent  union  occurs  between  carbon  atoms  in  organic 
compounds,  these  latter  are  frequently  capable  of  uniting  with  further 
elementary  atoms,  especially  so  with  the  halogens  and  with  nascent 
hydrogen,  with  change  of  the  polyvalent  union  into  monovalent. 

For  example,  the  molecule  of  ethylene  — 


absorbs  a  molecule  of  chlorine  (Cl2),  being  thereby  converted  into  an 
ethane  derivative  :

Compounds  capable  of  union  in  this  way  are  termed  unsaturated. 

When  the  capacity  of  saturation  of  a  carbon  nucleus  is  less  than 
CnH2n+2,  on  account  of  its  being  closed  in  a  ring  form,  the  mole- 
cule acts  as  though  saturated — i.e.  cannot  combine  directly  with 
halogens,  nascent  hydrogen,  &c.  In  open  chains  the  maximum 
capacity  of  saturation  reachable  is  2  n  +  2,  in  single  closed  rings  =  2  n, 
in  molecules  with  double  rings  2  n  —  2,  &c. 

Whilst,  for  example,  the  molecule

would  not  be  easily  affected,  the  nucleus  valency  remaining  2  n,  as 
there  is  in  it  only  monovalent  carbon  union,  difficult  to  disjoin. 


POLYMERISM  AND  METAMERISM.  35 

Isomerism. 

43.  In  the  foregoing  paragraphs  frequent  mention  has  been  made 
of  compounds  which,  though  possessing  the  same  general  molecular 
formulae,  exhibit  different  properties  in  consequence  of  the  varying 

arrangements  of  their  elementary  atoms,  being,  in  fact,  different 
chemical  bodies.  Such  compounds  are  termed  isomeric  (from  IffOfttp^c, 
composed  of  equal  parts.)  The  term  isomerism  has  in  general  a  still 
further  meaning,  being  applied  to  all  bodies  which  on  ultimate 
analysis  show  the  same  percentage  composition — that  is,  contain  the 
same  elements  in  the  same  ratio.  In  consequence  isomerism  is 
divisible  into  several  varieties. 

44.  Poll/in-  ri-tui.  -Bodies  of  the  same  percentage  composition  but 
of  different  molecular  weight  are  termed  polymeric  compounds. 
Their  molecular  formulae  are  either  whole  multiples  of  one  another 
or  at  least  of  the  same  simplest  atomic -ratio  formula. 

Such  a  difference  has  already  been  mentioned  in  §  22. 

The  simplest  ratio  formula         .         CH20

carbons whose  formula?  are  multiples  of  CH2.

Butylene  .  .  C4H8 

Amylene  .  .  C5H10 

Hexylene  .  .  C6HI2           &c. 

These  latter  show  considerable  resemblance  in  their  properties. 

From  this  variety  of  polymerism,  in  which  the  difference  is  in  the 
molecular  weight  only,   there  is  distinguishable    the  further  c. 

'<•  polymerism.  There  is,  namely,  a  pretty  large  number  of  organic 
holies,  which  under  certain  circumstances  are  transformed  directly 
into  polymeric  compounds  of  similiar  chemical  properties,  in  which 
several  similar  molecules  have  onited  to  a  single  new  one.  Fre- 
quently this  latter  can  he  reconverted  into  the  less  complex  original 
molecules  by  very  simple  means  for  instance,  by  action  of  a  high 
temperature. 

Aldehyde,  a  liquid  boiling  at  21°,  and  which  is  raiseible  with 
water  in  every  proportion,  by  contact  with  acids  is  converted  into 
paraldehyde,  boiling  at  124°  and  scarcely  soluble  in  water;  this  latter, 
on  superheating  its  vapour,  is  reconverted  into  aldehyde. 

45.  Metamerism.  In  manyca  [ual  molecular  weight  and 
equal  perc  i,  the  respective  compounds  are  decom- 
posed into  several  organic  bodies  by  reagents  that  are  incapable  of 
breaking  the  connection  between  the  carbon  atoms  in  the  nuclei. 
Such  compounds,  therefore,  o  veralcarbon  nuclei  united  to 
another  by  atoms  of  polyvalent  elements,  such  as  oxygen,  sulphur, 
nitrogen,  Arc.     in  these  cases  the  bodi<  1  to  be  metan

46.  Structural  Isomerism. — "When  the  difference  between  several 
organic  bodies  of  the  same  molecular  formula  is  not  due  to  meta- 
merism, they  are  isomers  in  the  strict  sense  of  the  word,  true  isomers 
or  structural  isomers.  The  organic  radicals  contained  in  them  are  of 
the  same  weight ;  the  carbon  nuclei  contain  the  same  number  of  atoms  ; 
the  difference  in  properties  is  caused  by  difference  of  position  of 
points  of  attachment  of  other  atoms  to  the  nucleus  (§  39),  or  the 
difference  of  structure  in  nuclei  of  like  number  of  carbon  atoms.

As  our  knowledge  of  the  inner  constitution  of  organic  bodies  is  still 
in  a  great  many  cases  very  imperfect,  and  frequently  entirely  wanting, 
it  results  that  for  numerous  undoubted  cases  of  structural  isomerism 
we  are  unable  to  settle  to  which  kind  it  is  due. 

47.  Physical  Isomerism.  In  a  very  \\  w  eases  organic  oompoonds 
of  the  same  molecular  formulas,  and  possessing  the  same  chemical 
properties,  and  in  which  any  difference  in  structure  is  ool  only  non- 
recognisable  but  highly  improbable,  exhibit  differences  in  certain  of 
their   physical    properties,    more   especially   in  their  behaviour   with 

polarised  light.      Such  bodies  are  termed  physical  isomers. 

One  of  the   moat  Striking   instances  of  this   kind  of  isomerism  [s

which,  prepared  from  the  juice  of  flesh,  rotates  the  plane  of  polari- 
sation of  a  beam  of  polarised  light,  whilst  that  modification  of  the 
acid  obtained  by  the  fermentation  of  sugar  is  without  any  action  on 
polarised  light. 

Very  probably  the  reason  of  the  difference  between  bodies  only 
physically  isomeric  lies  in  an  easily  imaginable  difference  in  the 
arrangement  in  space  of  atoms  which  are  still  united  chemically  in 
exactly  the  same  way  (geometric  isomerism). 

Homology  a>:d  Homologous  Series. 

48.  In  opposition  to  the  remarkable  differences  between  organic 
bodies  of  like  molecular  formula?,  is  the  fact  that  bodies  of  different 
molecular  composition  frequently  exhibit  great  similarity  in  all  their 
chemical  and  physical  properties. 

The  compounds  in  which  these  analogies  are  most  marked  are  those 
whose  formulas  differ  by  CH2,  or  a  whole  multiple  thereof,  uCH2> 
and  whose  molecular  weights  differ  therefore  by  +  Ihi.  It  is  of 
course  obvious,  from  what  has  been  said  before,  that  a  difference  in 
composition  of  CH2  does  not  make  similar  properties  a  necessary 
consequence;  this  only  occurs  when  the  respective  substances  agree 
with  one  another  in  their  chemical  constitution,  their  structure,  and 
all  essential  points.  This  analogy  of  structure  is  especially  shown  in 
the  fact  that  like  reagents  produce  like  changes,  and  further  that  the 
resulting  products  of  such  changes  agree  in  properties,  but  differ  in 
composition  by  CH2.  Such  bodies  are  termed  homologous  compou 
They  form  members  of  a  natural  family  of  bodies  which  can  be 
arranged  according  to  their  increasing  contents  of  carbon.  The  simi- 
larity of  physical  properties  between  the  members  of  a  homologous 
series  is  greater  the  nearer  they  stand  to  one  another  on  such  a  list — 
that  is,  the  less  they  differ  in  chemical  composition. 

Such  a  homologous  series  is  formed,  for  example,  by 

Methylic  alcohol  .         .         .        CH40 
Ethylic         „  C.,H60

HOMOLOGY  AND   HOMOLOGOUS  SERIES.  39 

The  members  of  this  homologous  series  are  all  acted  on  in 
like  manner  by  hydrochloric  acid,  yielding 

CH3CI 

C2H5C1 

C3H7C1 

C4H9C1  &c. 

All  members  of  a  homologous  series  can  be  expressed  by  a  single 
general  formula — that  for  the  above  alcohols,  e.g.,  is  OnH2n+20,  or 
OnH2n+1.OH. 

As  the  products  of  the  same  reaction  also  form  a  homologous 
series,  the  reaction  may  be  represented  by  a  general  equation.  The 
conversion  of  the  alcohols  into  the  corresponding  series  of  chlorides 
is  given  by  the  single  general  equation  : 

CuH2n+1.OH  +  HCl=CnH2n+1Cl  +.  H20. 

49.  The  homology  of  organic  bodies  may  be  more  or  less  complete ; 
it  is  the  more  complete  the  larger  the  number  of  homologous  pro- 
ducts that  can  be  obtained  from  them,  and  the  more  energetic  the 
reactions  producing  such  products.     For  example,  methylic  alcohol, 

CH3 
CH3  I 

,  is  as  completely  homologous  as  possible  to  ethylic  alcohol,  CH2, 
OH  / 

OH 
or  CH3.CH2.OH.  Of  the  two  propylic  alcohols,  on  the  other  hand,  one 
is  so  in  less  degree  than  the  other ;  but  both  are  acted  upon  in  the 
above-mentioned  way  by  the  halogen  acids  : 

CH3.OH  +  HC1  =  CH3CI  +  OH2 
CH3.CH2.OH  +  HC1  =  CH3.CH2.C1  +  OH,. 

1.  CH3.CH2.CH2.OH  +  HC1  =  CH3.CH2.CH2.C1  +  OH2. 

2.  CH3.CH(OH).CH3  +  HC1  =  CH3.CHC1.CH3  +  OH2. 

Towards  oxygen,  however,  their  behaviour  is  essentially  different. 
By  the  action  of  one  atom  of  oxygen  they  all  yield  oxides  of  the 
general  formula  CnH,nO;  but  that  from  the  first  propylic  alcohol 
only  is  really  homologous  to  those  from  both  the  lower  homologues  : 

CH3.OH  +  O  =  CH2.0  +  OH2 
CH3.CH2.OH  +  O  =  CH3.CHO  +  OH2 
CH3.CH2.CH2.OH  +  O  =  CH3.CH2.CHO  +  OH2, 

as  these  are  all  converted  into  homologous  organic  acids  according  to 
the  general  equation  : 

C„H2nO  +  0  =  OnH2n+1O.OH. 

The  oxidation  product  from  the  second  propylic-  alcohol,  CH3.CO.CH3, 
though  containing  CH,  more  than  Cir3.CHO,  still  oannot  unite 
simply  with  more  oxygen,  but  on  further  oxidation  takes  up  several 

oxygen  atoms,  with  breaking  up  of  the  carbon  nucleus. 


40  INTRODUCTION. 

Physical  Properties  of  Organic  Bodies. 
Molecular  and  Atomic  Volume. 

50.  The  densities  of  organic  bodies  are  the  relative  weights  of 
equal  volumes,  at  equal  temperatures,  expressed  in  abstract  numbers ; 
their  specific  gravities  the  weight  of  the  volume  unit  of  a  cubic 
centimetre  in  grams.  If  the  gram  molecular  weight  of  a  body  be 
divided  by  the  specific  gravity  at  a  given  temperature,  the  specific 
volume  for  that  temperature — i.e.  the  volume  in  cubic  centimetres 
of  the  molecular  weight  expressed  in  grams — is  obtained.  If  the 
specific  volumes  be  divested  of  their  concrete  significance,  and  conceived 
as  abstract  numbers  only,  they  then  form  the  relative  molecular 
volumes.  For  example,  the  specific  gravity  at  0°  of  acetic  acid  is 
1-075,  its  molecular  weight  =  60.  Sixty  grams  of  acetic  acid  at  that 
temperature  would  therefore  occupy  a  volume  of  55'8  c.c;  this,  then,  is 
its  specific  volume.  The  specific  volume  of  ethylic  alcohol  at  0°  is 
similarly  obtained  as  57*05.  Therefore  the  true  molecules  of  acetic 
acid  and  of  ethylic  alcohol  occupy  at  0°  spaces  which  are  in  the  ratio 
of  55'8  :  57*1,  these  numbers  forming  the  relative  molecular  volumes 
of  the  bodies. 

51.  Gases  and  vapours  in  the  gaseous  state  contain,  under  like 
conditions  of  temperature  and  pressure,  the  same  number  of  molecules 
in  the  same  volume.  Their  specific  and  molecular  volumes  are,  under 
the  above  conditions,  equal  to  one  another,  whilst  the  specific  gravities 
are  directly  as  the  molecular  weights. 

52.  As  fluids  and  solids  <lo  not  expand  equally  for  equal  incre- 
ments of  temperature,  they  are  not  under  like  conditions  of  heat  at 
equal  temperatures;  their  specific  and  molecular  volumes  at  like 
temperatures  show  no  simple  relation  to  one  another.  The  molecular 
volumes  of  liquids  near  their  boiling  points,  and  of  solids  at  their 
fusing  points,  show  relations  reducible  to  laws.  These  have  been 
studied  with  more  exactness  in  the  case  of  liquids.  If  the  molecular 
volumes  of  homologous  compounds  at  their  respective  boiling  points 
be  compared  with  one  another,  there  is  found  a  difference  proportional 
to  that  in  the  molecular  weights,  the  molecular  volume  altering  by 
about  22  for  each  alteration  of  the  composition  by  CH2  :

In  bodies  which  contain  an  equal  number  of  atoms  of  oxygen,  but 
differ  in  their  composition  by  ( —  C  +  H2)x,  the  molecular  volumes 
are  equal  :

MOLECULAR  AND  ATOMIC  VOLUME.

The  increase  in  the  molecular  volume  by  the  addition  of  two  hydrogen 
atoms  is  therefore  as  great  as  the  diminution  produced  by  the  removal 
of  one  carbon  atom,  or  the  change  in  molecular  volume  by  an  atom  of 
carbon  is  twice  as  great  as  that  produced  by  an  atom  of  hydrogen. 
As  the  group  CH2  in  homologous  compounds  alters  the  molecular 
volume  by  22,  the  C  and  H2  must  have  equal  parts  thereof — i.e.  the 
alteration  caused  by  a  carbon  atom  =  11,  by  each  hydrogen  atom 
n/2  =  5'5.  These  alteration  values  of  the  single  elementary  atoms 
are  termed  their  atomic  volumes. 

Atomic  volume  C  =  11. 
Atomic  volume  H  =    5 "5. 

The  atomic  volumes  of  other  elements  can  be  calculated  in  a  similar 
maimer. 

An  alcohol  on  conversion  into  an  acid  loses  two  hydrogen  atoms, 
which  are  replaced  by  one  oxygen  atom,  united  by  both  its  bonds  to 
the  same  carbon  atom.  The  alteration  produced  in  molecular  volume 
is  very  small,  the  mean  result  being  +  1*2;  e.g.

This  gives  as  the  molecular  volume  mv'  of  a  compound  resulting 
from  the  replacement  of  2H  by  0,  from  the  change  of  the  ingredients, 
=  mv'-11  +  12*2. 

The  atomic  volume,  therefore,  of  oxygen  when  united  to  carbon  by 
both  its  bonds  =  12*2. 

The  molecular  volume  is  not  altered  to  the  same  amount  by  an 
oxygen  atom,  which  is  united  by  one  of  its  bonds  only  to  a  carbon 
atom.     From    a   variety   of   determinations   the   atomic    volume    of 

:en,  when  united  in  this  way,  is  found  to  be  about  6*4.

Prom  these  numbers   the  molecular  volume  of  any  organic   compound 
can  be  calculated  if  the    method  of  union  of  any  oxygen,  sulphur,    or 

nitrogen  atoms  be  known  ;  e.g.

These  results  can  also  be  applied  in  determining  the  method  of 
union  of  the  oxygen,  sulphur,  and  nitrogen  atoms  in  organic  com- 
pounds. 

If  in  the  case  of  aldehyde,  C2H40,  for  instance,  it  were  necessary 
to  ascertain  whether  the  formula  should  be  written  C.,H3.OH  or 
OH,

whilst  the  second  would  give 

2.11+4.  5-:»  +  12-2  =  56-2. 

From  the  specific  gravity  of  the  body  near  its  boiling  point  (21°  C.) 
the  molecular  volume  is  found  to  be  56*45,  showing  the  second  for- 
mula to  be  correct. 

It  must  be  remarked,  however,  that  the  numbers  calculated  in 
the  above  way  in  many  cases  do  not  agree  in  a  satisfactory  manner 
with  the  molecular  volumes  derived  from  the  found  specific  gravity. 
The  values  of  the  atomic  volumes  are  still  in  part  encumbered  with 
considerable  errors,  and  this  must  especially  be  the  case  with  the 
atomic  volume  of  carbon. 

Just  as  an  oxygen  atom  has  a  different  atomic  volume,  when 
united  by  both  bonds  to  the  same  atom,  to  that  which  it  has  when 
united  by  one  bond  only,  so  carbon  may  have  different  values  accord- 
ing to  whether  it  is  united  to  another  carbon  atom  by  one,  two,  or 
three  bonds.

MELTING  POINTS.  43 

The  results  of  which  the  above  is  a  summary  were  obtained  at  a  time 
when  the  idea  of  a  difference  of  the  method  of  union  of  O,  S,  and  N 
had  already  been  partly  evolved,  but  before  any  idea  had  been  formed 
of  the  method  of  union  of  the  carbon  atoms.  It  is  scarcely  to  be 
doubted  that  although  a  number  of  important  points  have  been 
determined,  still  a  repetition  of  the  investigations,  based  on  more 
complete  recent  theoretical  views,  would  lead  to  very  important 
modifications  in  our  notions  of  atomic  volumes. 

The  investigations  of  the  molecular  volume  of  solid  organic  bodies 
at  analogous  temperatures  are  not  yet  sufficiently  complete  to  enable 
any  laws  to  be  deduced  from  them. 

Melting  Points  and  Boiling  Points  of  Organic  Bodies. 

53.  As  melting  and  boiling  points  are  amongst  the  characteristic 
properties  of  chemical  bodies,  they  must  be  affected  by  the  nature, 
number,  and  method  of  union  of  the  elementary  atoms  forming  the 
molecule.  In  what  way  these  factors  react  upon  the  temperatures 
of  fusion  and  ebullition  is,  however,  not  yet  known,  so  that  it  is 
not  possible  to  predict  a  priori  these  temperatures.  Comparative  in- 
vestigations have,  however,  at  least  shown  a  few  general  laws,  of 
which  the  following  are  the  most  important : — 

54.  Melting  Point. — In  homologous  series  the  melting  point  fre- 
quently— but  by  no  means  invariably — increases  with  the  molecular 
weight  of  the  compound,  without,  however,  these  changes  showing  any 
complete  parallelism  with  one  another  ;  e.g.

In  many  cases  the  group  CH3  exerts  an  influence  in  raising  the 
melting  point  even  where  the  CH3  is  united  to  the  carbon  nucleus 
by  means  of  other  elements,  showing  itself  in  opposition  to  the  rule

55.  Boiling  Points. — In  homologous  series  the  boiling  points  of 
the  individual  members  mostly  increase  with  the  molecular  weights, 
and  in  cases  of  complete  homology  (§  49)  veiy  nearly  proportionally 
to  this  increase  in  the  molecular  weight.

The  view  formerly  held  that  the  alteration  of  the  molecular  weight 
was  completely  proportional  to  that  of  the  boiling  point  has  not  been 
corroborated  by  sufficient  proof.

pounds boil  at  the  lowest  temperature,  the  by.  bomsappe

observed  that  in  compounds  of  similar  constitution  in  every  respect 
but  that  one  contains  less  hydrogen  than  the  other,  the  one  richest 
in  hydrogen  boils  at  the  lowest  teinpei-ature.

57.  Isomerism,  due  to  the  structure  of  bodies,  exerts  a  very  remark- 
able influence  on  the  boiling  point.  It  appears  in  cases  of  nucleus 
isomerism  that  the  boiling  point  of  the  derivative  of  the  normal 
carbon  chains  is  always  the  highest,  and  that,  in  the  tatty  group  of 
bodies,  it  sinks  with  the  number  of  side  chains,  so  that  increase  in  the 
numl>er  of  CH3  groups  exerts  here  exactly  the  opposite  influence  to 
that  which  it  has  on  the  melting  point ;  for  instance  :

If,  fa  a  hydrogenised  organic  body,  hydrogen  atoms  are  replaced 
by  other  elements,  or  by  compound  radicals,  the  boiling  ]>oiiit  is  raised. 
If  place  isomerism  can  occur,  the  position  of  the  substituted  hydn 
atom  will  have  a  specific  influence  on  the  amount  of  increase.  In  the 
first  substitution  derivatives  of  the  hydrocarbons,  CnHan  +  2,  for 
example,  the  derivative  of  a  terminal  and  primarily  united  carbon 
atom  bas  always  a  higher  boiling  point  than  that  of  an  intermediate 
secondarily  united  isomer  of  the  same  nucleus,  and  the  boiling  point 
of  the  place-isomeric  tertiary  products  is  still  lower  than  this  last.

REFRACTION    EQUIVALENTS.  51 


Rejrcution  of  Light. 


58.  The  quotient  of  the  sine  of  the  angle  of  incidence  d)  of  a  beam 
of  light  of  known  wave-length  passing  from  air  into  another  trans 
parent  medium,  divided  by  tli"  sine  of  the  angle  of  refraction  (r),  is 
the  refractive  index  (n)  of  this  latter  medium,  and  as  such  is  of 
constant  value  for  each  especial  medium  : 

.sin   i 

=  u 

sin  r

The  value  ,  where  d  expresses  the  density  of  the  respective 

medium,  is  termed  the  specific  refractive  power,  and  the  product  of 
the  hitter  into  the.  molecular  weight  p  of  the  medium  i-  termed  the 
refrpction-equivalenl  of  the  latter. 

Sufficiently  accurate  estimations  of  this  latter  amount  for  a  con- 
siderable  number  of  pure  organic  compounds,  selecl  <1  however  nearly

whilst  still  having  a  similar  molecular  composition,  differed  only 
by  having  a  different  contents  of  the  atoms  of  a  single  element, 
the  proportion  which  the  single  elementary  atoms  have  in  that  value 
has  beeD  approximately  settled.  For  example,  bodies  containing  the 
same  number  of  oxygen  and  hydrogen  atoms,  but  differing  from  each 
other  by  n  carbon  atoms,  give  a  mean  difference  of  5  n,  so  that

and  that  of  .  .  .      O  =  3-00 

From  these  values  th<>  refraction  equivalents  of  organic  bodies  can 
be  calculated  approximately;  e.g.

Optical  Rotary  Power. 

61.  Many  organic  compounds,  mostly  those  physiologically  resulting 
in  the  living  organism,  show  the  property,  when  in  a  Squid  condition 
(or  in  solution),  some  even  as  vapour,  of  rotating  the  plane  of  polari- 


DRY   DISTILLATION.  53 

Ration  of  a  beam  of  polarised  light.  Such  bodies  are  termed  optically 
active. 

At  constant  temperature  the  degree  of  rotation  of  the  polarised 
beam  depends  on  the  length  of  the  layer  of  the  active  medium  through 
which  the  ray  has  to  pass  (and  on  the  amount  of  active  substance  if 
in  solution).  If  the  length  of  the  layer  be  kept  constant,  and  if  no 
chemical  change  ensues  on  dilution,  the  amount  of  rotation  is  propor- 
tional to  the  concentration  of  the  solution. 

The  specific  rotation,  or  optical  rotary  povjer,  is  the  angle  («») 
which  is  given  by  passage  of  a  polarised  ray  through  a  layer  one  deci- 
metre long  of  the  rotary  polarising  substance  (in  the  case  of  dissolved 
substances  containing  one  gram  of  active  substance  in  each  c.c.  of 
solution).  This  rotary  power  is  one  of  the  essentially  constant  pro- 
perties of  the  respective  organic  substances. 

The  optical  activity  appears  not  to  depend  on  the  chemical  structure, 
as  active  bodies  are  converted  into  inactive  isomeric  modifications 
without  change  of  structure  or  of  essential  chemical  properties.  Very 
frequently  this  change  ensues  on  mere  warming.  The  reason  of  this 
different  behaviour  of  optically  isomeric  organic  bodies  of  similar 
structure  is  still  unexplained,  but  may  be  due  to  a  different  arrange- 
ment of  the  atoms  in  space,  the  actual  connection  between  the  atoms 
still  being  the  same. 

Action  of  High  Temperature  on  Organic  Compounds. 

62.  All  carbon  compounds  suffer  chemical  change  when  heated  to 
sufficiently  high  temperature.  This  latter  depends  on  the  number, 
nature,  and  grouping  of  the  elementary  atoms  in  the  molecule,  and 
differs  greatly  with  different  bodies.  Solid  or  liquid  bodies  which 
cannot  be  distilled  unchanged,  only  require  to  be  heated  in  distillation 
vessels,  which  prevent  the  access  of  oxygen ;  bodies  which  volatilise 
unchanged,  require  to  be  heated  to  temperatures  above  their  boiling 
points.  This  is  best  effected  by  passing  their  vapours  through  glow- 
ing tubes,  the  greatest  possible  contact  between  the  walls  of  the 
tube  mid  the  vapour  being  obtained.  The  process  of  chemical  change 
effected  by  strong  heating,  the  dissociation  of  organic  bodies,  is  termed 
dry  distillation.  It  depends  on  the  general  action  of  high  temperatures 
in  weakening  or  destroying  the  chemical  affinities  which  have  held  the 
atoms  together,  so  that  decompositions  ensue,  accompanied  by  the 
formation  of  new  bodies  more  stable  at  high  temperatures. 

In  many  cases  the  decomposition  is  of  very  simple  nature,  and,  as 
a  rule,  then  occurs  with  elimination  of  water,  or  carbonic  anhydride, 
or  both  ;  e.g.

54  INTRODUCTION. 

Products  of  simpler  composition  are  not  invariably  formed.  Fre- 
quently at  the  moment  of  decomposition  several  nuclei  unite  together 
to  form  more  complex  products,  as,  for  instance,  in  the  dry  distillation 
of  salts  of  organic  acids,  where,  especially  in  the  case  of  alkaline  and 
alkaline  earthy  salts,  a  carbonate  is  left,  whilst  the  remaining  nuclei 
of  two  original  molecules  unite  to  form  a  new  compound,  e.g.  sodic 
acetate :

63.  Not  seldom  these  processes  occur  without  formation  of  essential 
quantities  of  bye-pro .1  nets,  but  mostly ,  especially  in  the  dry  distillation 
of  complex  bodies,  the  number  of  products  is  very  large,  and  includes 
bodies  of  both  greater  and  less  complexity.  The  distillation  products 
of  the  same  body  differ  essentially  in  nature,  quantity,  and  state  of 
aggregation  according  to  the  temperature  at  which  decomposition  is 
effected. 

In  the  dry  distillation  of  wood,  which  has  the  formula  C6H10Os,  or 
more  probably  some  multiple,  there  are  first  given  off  gases  and  an 
aqueous  liquid.  The  first  contains  much  C02,  later  follow  carbon 
monoxide,  then  gaseous  hydrocarbons,  such  as  0H4,  C2H4,  C2H2,  &C., 
and  on  very  strongly  heating,  hydrogen  also.  Water  at  first  passes 
over  in  largest  quantity,  but  is  soon  followed  by  acetic  acid,  C2H402, 
wood  spirit,  CH40,  acetone,  C3H60,  etc.,  which  remain  dissolved  in  the 
former.  When  the  oxygen  of  the  wood  has  been  in  great  part  removed 
in  the  form  of  these  and  similar  highly  oxygenated  compounds,  there 
follow  (generally  at  the  same  time  as  the  gaseous  hydrocarbons)  more 
difficultly  vapourisable  compounds,  poorer  in  oxygen,  and  of  more  com- 
plex constitution,  such  as  phenol  C6H60,  cresol  C7H80,  &c,  as  also 
hydrocarbons  of  higher  molecular  weight,  e.g.  benzol  06HG,  naph- 
thalene C10H8,  anthracene  C,4H10,  <fcc.  These  all  condense  in  cooled 
receivers,  and  form  two  layers,  an  aqueous  and  an  oily.  The  latter 
is  nearly  invariably  of  a  dark  colour,  and  consists  of  solutions  of  solid 
bodies  in  oily  products,  and  often  mixed  with  bodies  still  solid.  This 
layer  is  termed  tar.  From  tar  the  various  constituents  which  boil 
at  different  temperatures  can  be  generally  separated  by  fractional  dis- 
tillation. As  a  rule,  those  bodies  which  are  liquid  at  ordinary  tem- 
peratures distil  sooner  than  solids.  If  the  first  are  distilled  oft*,  a 
brownish  black  resinous  mass,  termed  pitch,  is  left. 

In  the  original  distillation  vessel  a  residue  of  charcoal  is  left, 
still  containing  all  the  mineral  constituents  of  the  original  sub- 
stance,   which  are    left    as    ash    on  complete  combustion.       In    the 


PUTREFACTION   AND    DECAY. 

dry  distillation  of  nitrogenous  bodies,  much  ammonia  is  evolved,  and 
is  found  as  carbonate  in  the  aqueous  distillate,  whilst  the  tar  then 
invariably  contains  nitrogenous  Liquid  bases,  Buohas  aniline,  pyridine, 

etc.,  and  the  residual   charcoal  still  contains  some  nitrogen,  which 

cannot  be  separated  from  the  carbon  even  at  a  white  heat. 

Putrefaction,  Decay,  and  Fermentation  of  Organic  /j<> 

64.  If  organic  bodies  are  left  in  a  damp  condition  at  ordinary 
temperatures,  many  of  them  Buffer  apparently  completely  spontaneous 
changes,  whose  products  show  some  similarity  to  those  of  dry  decom- 
position.    There  are  formed,  namely,  in  addition  to  gases  and  volatile 

bodies,  frequently  of  unpleasant    odour  (odour  of  putrefaction),  also 
aqueous  and  even  oily  products  and  tarlike  masses,  or  at  least  a  dark- 
coloured   residue,  rich  in  carbon   (humus).     In  general,  the  n 
blance  of  these  products  to  those  of  dry  distillation,  are  the  close),  the 
more  completely  oxygen  has  been  excluded  during  their  formation. 

These  changes  are,  however,  in  all  probability  never  entirely  spon- 
taneous.  To  their  initiation  an  exposure,  however  short,  to  air  is 
essential;  they  are  prevented  by  high  or  May  low  temperatures,  by 
absence  of  water,  and  by  the  presence  of  certain  poisonous  bodies — 
antiseptic  media.  Amongst  these  latter  are  arsenious  acid,  mercury 
and  zinc  salts,  tannin,  creosote,  and  also  common  salt  in  concentrated 
solution. 

65.  During  the  exposure  of  putrescible  bodies  to  air,  they  come  in 
contact  with  the  germs  of  microscopic  organised  beings,  which  by 
their  evolution  and  multiplication  are  the  primary  cause  of  decom- 
position. As  their  vegetation  occurs  most  rigorously  at  temperatures 
of  lM)o-30°,  they  most  readily  cause  decomposition  at  these  tempe- 
ratures. Below  0°  these  beings  lose  the  power  of  growth  for  at  least 
the  time  of  duration  of  that  temperature.  At  temperatures  near  the 
boiling  point  of  water  they  are  killed  like  all  other  organisms,  as  also 
by  antiseptic  poisons. 

66.  Putrefaction  and  decay  cannot  be  sharply  separated  from  one 
another;    by  the   firsl    term    are   meant  those   decomposition   prOO 
which    occur   under    the    aid    of    organisms,    ami    without     action    of 

oxygen,  whilst  in  decay  intense  oxidising  action  occurs  at  the  exp 
of  the  atmospheric  oxygen. 

To  putrescible  bodies  especially  belong  the  nitrogenous  and  sul- 
phuretted constituents  of  animals  and  plants,  the  albuminoid  bodies 
or   proteid    substances:   e.g.  albumen,    casein,  the   substance  of  muscle 

and  membrane,  &c 

67.  A    very  minute  amount  of   the   above  montiom  d  putrefaction 

excitants  can  cause  the  decomposition  of  very  considerable  quantities 
of  decomposable  bodies,  the  latter  probably  serving  as  the  nutritive 
materia]  for  many  quickly  following  generations  of  the  first.  The  de- 
composition products  must  then    be  considered  ;i>  the  excreta  of  these 

organism-.  Such  reactions  as  these  are  termed  fermentations,  and 
the  bodies  causing  the  change,  whilst  they  themselves  apparently  take 
no  visible  part,  are  termed jermenU. 

68.  One  and  the  same  body  may  undergo  very  different  decompo- 
sitions, according  to  the  nature  of  the  ferment  acting  on  it,  or  according 


56  INTRODUCTION. 

to  the  variations  in  the  growth  of  the  ferment  produced  by  tempera- 
ture, amount  of  moisture,  &c. 

Cane  sugar,  e.g.,  in  contact  with  many  organised  ferments,  is  con- 
verted— with  combination  of  the  elements  of  water — into  glucose  : 

Ci2H22On  -f  H20  =  2C6H1206; 

(Cane  sugar.)  (Glucose.) 

whilst  the  solution  of  the  latter  is  converted  by  the  ferment  of  putrid 
prote'i'd  bodies  into  lactic  acid  : 

C6H1206  =  2C3H603  (lactic  acid), 

wiiich  is  further  converted  into  butyric  acid,  with  evolution  of  car- 
bonic anhydride  and  hydrogen : 

2C3H603  =  C4H8qa  +  2  C02  +  2H2, 

(Butyric  acid.) 

If  any  unaltered  glucose  be  present  during  this  latter  fermentation  it 
is  converted  into  mannite  : 

C«H120G  +  2H  =  C6H1406  (mannite). 

These  and  similar  fermentations  occurring  without  direct  participa- 
tion of  atmospheric  oxygen,  may  be  considered  as  putrefactive  pro- 
cesses, as  also  the  decomposition  of  glucose  into  carbonic  anhydride 
and  alcohol  under  the  influence  of  yeast  : 

C6Hl206  =  2C02  +  2C2H60  (alcohol). 

In  other  fermentations  the  atmospheric  oxygen  is  actively  engaged, 
as  in  the  acetic  fermentation  of  alcohol : 

C2H60  +  02=  H20  +  C2H402  (acetic  acid). 

These,  however,  more  closely  resemble  the  decay  processes  of  complex 
albuminoid  bodies. 

69.  As  already  mentioned,  the  ferments  are  frequently  organised, 
often  single  cells  of  plant-like  nature,  sometimes  also  having  the 
power  of  motion,  as  in  the  butyric  ferment.  There  are  also  some 
ferments  which  are  not  organised,  such  as  synaptase  and  diastase ; 
these  are  soluble  in  water,  and  under  favourable  circumstances  can 
cause  large  quantities  of  certain  other  compounds  to  suffer  specific 
changes. 

The  amygdalin  of  bitter  almonds  in  presence  of  water  is  decom- 
posed, by  the  synaptase  contained  in  the  same  seeds,  into  bitter 
almond  oil,  glucose,  and  hydrocyanic  acid  : 

C20H27NOn  +  2H20  =  CNH  +  2C6H1206  +  C7HbO. 

(Amygdaline.) 

No  other  ferment  is  capable  of  producing  this  decomposition 

Not  seldom  inorganic  compounds  can  act  on  organic  bodies  in  a 
ferment-like  manner,  especially  strong  acids  and  sometimes  strong 
basic  hydrates. 

70.  By  processes  of  putrefaction,  decay,  and  fermentation,  animals 


OYANOGEM   COMPOUNDS.  57 

:ui<l  plants  gradually  vanish  after  death,  only  the  dob  volatile  mineraJ 
constituents  remaining  behind.     By  long-continued  addition  of  0x3 
gen  they  are  converted  into  volatile  products,  especially  into  carbonic 
anhydride,  water,  and  ammonia,  which  then  serve  anew  as  nourish- 
ment to  the  vegetable  world. 

It  is  often  of  great  economical  importance  to  piesoive  unchanged 
the  very  putrescible  nitrogenous  foods.  This  may  be  effected  either 
by  placing  them  under  conditions  under  which  fermentation  is  im- 
possible, even  in  the  presence  of  ferments,  as,  for  instance,  by  freezing, 
or  by  destroying  all  ferments  present. 

By  bringing  bodies  capable  of  putrefying  into  contact  with  salt, 
Bugar,  alcohol,  or  similar  media,  the  water  necessary  for  fermentation 
is  removed,  and  they  therefore  remain  unchanged.  The  same  result 
is  arrived  at  by  drying  at  high  temperatures.  By  smoking  another 
result  is  obtained  in  addition  to  drying,  the  substances  getting 
rated  with  creosote,  volatile  oils,  <fec.,  which  kill  the  organisms 
causing  putrefaction. 

The  conservation  of  foods  by  Appert's  method,  which  consists  in 
heating  them  in  tins  to  the  temperature  of  boiling  water,  and  then 
hermetically  closing  the  latter  whilst  still  at  that  temperature,  depends 
on  the  destruction  of  all  putrefactives  at  the  boiling  heat.  So  Ioe 
no  air  can  reach  the  food  to  convey  fresh  germs  to  it,  it  remains  un- 
altered at  ordinary  temperatures  j  from  the  moment  of  contact  with 
air  putrefactive  action  starts,  which  can  be  again  destroyed  by  heating 
to  boiling. 

In  order  to   preserve  anatomical   preparations,   they  are  ti 
with  solutions  of  mercuric  chloride,,  zincic  chloride,  arsenious acid,  &c. 

The  chief  mass  of  wood,  the  cell  substance,  is  not.  capable  of  putre- 
faction, but  from  the  presence  of  albuminous  substances  in  the  wood, 
which  can  go  into  putrefaction  under  favourable  conditions,  the 
woody  fibre  is  often  destroyed.  This  is  prevented  either  by  washing 
the  putrescible  substances  out  of  the  wood  (by  steaming  under  pres 
I,  or  by  forcing  substances  into  it  which  prevent  putrefaction 
(antiseptic  media).  The  wood  is  saturated  with  cupric  sulphate  or 
corrosive  sublimate  solutions,  or  with  'pyrolignate  01  iron.'  in  which 
latter  case  the  presence  of  creosote  is  especially  active. 


CYANOGEN    COMPOUNDa 

71.   By  the  name  cyanogen  the  group  <N  (==  C y)  is  undei 
which  acts  generally  as  a  monovalent  radical     It  can  exist  in  several 
modifications,  accordingly  as  the  combining  metal  is  united  to  the 

carbon  or  to  the  nitrogen  atom. 

In  the  first  case,  the  two  elements  are  united  to  each  other  by 
three  bonds  ■ 

C=N

In  that  case  tin'  radical  is  termed!  trm  cyanogen  (generally  ey  1 
only)  or  earbonUriiet  and,  similarij  to  ammonia,  possessed  the   power,

after  the  saturation  of  the  fourth  carbon  bond,  of  forming  further  and 
less  stable  compounds  : 

H— C=N<^ 

In  the  second  modification  of  cyanogen,  Isocyanogen  or  Carbarn- 
nionium,  both  elements  appear  to  be  in  tetravalent  union,  so  that  the 
nitrogen  becomes  the  grouping  element  : 

CEN-R 

Finally,  there  is  a  third  modification,  Psetidocyanogt  //,  in  which 
the  C  and  N  are  in  divalent  union,  as  in  the  case  of  certain  cyanates, 
for  example  : 

K—8z=G=dO 

72.  Cyanogen  compounds  are  in  the  highest  degree  capable  of 
polymerisation.  That  the  reason  of  this  property  lie-;  in  the  cyanogen 
group  itself  is  indubitable;  still  the  manner  in  which  several  such 
groups  unite  to  a  single  radical  is  not  yet  determined  with  certainty. 
The  following  formula'  possess  probability,  and  arc  not  in  contradiction 
with  any  known  facts.  In  them,  as  in  carbonitrile,  every  carbon 
atom  is  united  by  three  bonds  to  nitrogen  atoms,  every  nitrogen  by 
three  bonds  to  carbon,  and  the  combination  to  other  elements  i*-;

HYDROCYANIC  ACID.  59 

73.  Formation,  of  Cyanogen  Compounds. — The  methods  of  forma 
tion  of  cyanogeD  compounds  by  the  simultaneous  decomposition  of 
carbonaceous  and  nitrogenous  compounds  are  pretty  numerous,  and 
will  be  spoken  of  hereafter.  Of  more  immediate  interest  is  the  for- 
mation of  the  cyanogen  group,  either  from  its  elements,  or  from  their 
mineral  compounds.  Although  carbon  and  nitrogen  will  not  unite 
with  one  another  directly,  yet  in  the  presence  of  strongly  positive 
metals  they  combine  and  form  the  respective  cyanides.  If,  for  instance, 
potassium  and  carbon  are  mixed,  and  the  mixture  heated  in  an  atmo- 
sphere of  nitrogen,  potassic  cyanide  is  obtained  : 

K,  +  2C  +  N,  =.  2KCN. 

Instead  of  employing  the  free  metal,  a  combination  of  the  method 
of  obtaining  it  from  its  carbonate  with  the  method  for  preparing  the 
cyanide  can  be  used  :  a  mixture  of  potassic  carbonate  is  heated  with 
excess  of  carbon  in  an  atmosphere  of  nitrogen  : 

K2C03  +  40  +  N2  =  3CO  +  2KCN. 

It  is  still  more  usual  to  employ  the  nitrogen  in  form  of  some  of  its 
compounds — ammonia  or  its  salts,  for  instance — but  best  of  all  in  the 
form  of  nitrogenous  animal  charcoal,  and  to  heat  the  latter  with  potassic 
carbonate.  Also  by  passing  ammonia  gas  over  ignited  charcoal,  a 
cyanogen  compound — amnionic  cyanide     is  obtained  : 

C  +  2NH3  =  NH4.CN  +  H2. 

The  crude  material  for  the  preparation  of  most  cyanogen  com- 
pounds is  potassic  cyanide,  prepared  by  one  of  the  above  methods, 
which,  for  convenience  in  purification,  is  next  converted  into  potassic 
ferrocyanide— yellow  prussiate — K4Fe('y,,. 


74.   IFyilrocyanic  Add,  or  Prussia  Acid. 

HCy  =  H— C=N. 
Hydrocyanic  acid  is  readily  obtained  from  parts  of  certain  plants, 

as  bitter  almonds,  kernels  of  stone  fruits.  Leaves  of  cherry,  laurel.  &C, 
when  they  are  left  \'ov  some  time  at  the  ordinary  temperature  in  a 
moist  and  finely  divided  state.  The  respective  parts  of  these  plants 
contain  a  bitter-tasting,  crystallisable  organic  substance,  amygdalin, 

tog  ther  w  itli  an  albuminoid  body,  Bynaptase  or  eniulsine.  which,  acting 
as  a  ferment  on  the  amygdalin,  causes  its  decomposition  ;  with  ad- 
dition of  the  elements  of  water,  the  amygdalin  is  converted   into 

hydrocyanic  acid.  >ugar,  and  bitter  almond  oil  : 

CaoH87NOn  +  2HaO  =  CNH  +  2C6H„06  +  c-H.n. 

In  the  pure  state,  hydrocyanic  acid  is  prepared  by  heating  metallic 
cyanides  with  strong  acids  ■

Usually  it   is   prepared    from    potassic  ferrocyanide.      Ten    pari

phuric  acid  and  forty  parts  of  water  in  a  flask  (fig.  16,  a),  connected,  by 
means  of  the  bent  tube  b,  with  the  condensing  apparatus  de,  The 
flask  is  heated  until  the  liquid  begins  to  boil,  and  the  distillate  is 
collected  in  the  receiver  b. 

There  is  thus  obtained  an  aqueous  prussic  acid,  which  readily  de- 
composes on  keeping  ;  the  addition  of  a  drop  of  sulphuric  acid  renders 
it  much  more  stable. 

By  the  action  of  sulphuric  acid  upon  potaseic  ferrocyanide,  only 
one-half  of  its  cyanogen  is  evolved  as  hydrocyanic  acid,  there  being 
formed    at    the    same   time    a    white    insoluble  cyanide  of   iron  and 


potassium    of  the   formula    K  ._,!■"  which   is  not  attacked   by 

dilute  sulphuric  acid.     The  reaction  taking  place  is  represented  by 
the  equation : 

2K  ,Fe(C6N6)  +  3H2S04  =  3K2S04  +  6HCN  +  K,Fe 

From  the  aqueous  hydrocyanic  acid,  the  anhydrous  acid  can  be 
obtained  by  fractional  distillation,  and  treatment  with  calcic  chloride  : 
the  pretty  concentrated  aqueous  solution  is  slightly  warmed,  and 
the  vapour  of  the  easily  volatile  acid  condensed  in  a  receiver  cooled  by 
means  of  ice,  and  containing  fused  calcic  chloride  in  coarse  powder. 
The  receiver  is  tightly  stoppered,  and  allowed  to  stand  till  the  salt 
has  united  to  all  the  water  ;  then,  by  application  of  gentle  heat,  the 
anhydrous  acid  is  distilled,  and  collected  in  a  receiver  cooled  by  a 
freezing  mixture  of  ice  and  salt. 


HYDROCYANIC   ACID.  61 

75.  Hydrocyanic  acid  is  a  colourless,  mobile  liquid,  solidifying 
at  15°  to  a  fibrous  crystalline  mass,  and  boiling  at  +  26'5°.  In 
consequence  it  evaporates  wich  extraordinary  rapidity,  and  thereby 
absorbs  so  much  heat  that  a  drop  placed  on  a  glass  rod  can  be  caused 
to  partly  solidify  by  being  moved  quickly  through  the  air.  The  density 
of  the  liquid  is  -7058  at  +  7°  and  '6969  at  +  18°,  vapour  density  948. 
The  odour  is  peculiar,  somewhat  resembling  that  of  bitter  almonds  ; 
the  vapour  of  the  acid  burns  with  a  pale  violet-coloured  flame. 

The  extraordinarily  poisonous  nature  of  hydrocyanic  acid  is  especially 
noticeable.  When  mixed  with  much  air,  and  inhaled  in  small  quantity, 
it  produces  a  peculiar  feeling  in  the  throat;  in  larger  quantity,  faintness, 
and  finally  death.  The  unmixed  vapour  of  the  anhydrous  acid  causes 
instant  death,  and  produces  equally  fatal  results  by  direct  contact  with 
the  blood.  In  very  small  doses  it  is  employed  as  a  medicine.  The 
acid  character  of  HON  is  not  strongly  pronounced ;  litmus  paper  is 
scarcely  reddened  by  it;  with  metallic  oxides,  however,  it  behaves 
similarly  to  the  halogen  hydroacids,  yielding  generally  metallic  cyanides 
and  water.  When  added  to  the  oxides  of  iron  it  readily  forms  ferric 
ferrocyanide  or  Prussian  blue,  from  which  substance  it  derives  its 
common  name  of  prussic  acid. 

This  formation  of  Prussian  blue  serves  for  the  detection  of  small 
traces  of  cyanogen  compounds.  Usually  the  liquid  to  be  tested  is 
mixed  with  a  ferrous  salt,  slight  excess  of  KHO  added,  and  the  liquid 
heated  for  a  short  time.     According  to  the  equations  : 

6HCN  +  FeS04  +-  8KOH  =  6KCN  +  Fe(OH)2  +  K2S04 
+  60H2 
and 

6KCN  +  Fe(OH)2  =  K4FeC6N6  +  2KOH 

potassic  ferrocyanide  is  formed;  on  then  adding  ferric  chloride  and 
acidulating  with  hydrochloric  acid,  a  deep  blue  precipitate  is  obtained. 
76.  By  keeping,  hydrocyanic  acid  soon  decomposes,  brown  solid 
bodies  separating,  and  amnionic  salts  being  formed.  As  already  men- 
tioned, a  trace  of  a  strong  acid  retards  this  decomposition,  as  does  also 
dilution  with  large  quan tit ies  of  water.  The  aqueous  solution  forms 
by  its  decomposition  some  quantity  of  amnionic  formate  :

By  boiling  with  alkalies  this  change  is  considerably  accelerated,  as  also

78.   The    metallic  cyanides   can   be  prepared,  almost    without 
cept  ion.  from   hydrocyanic   add,  though    only   in  the  case  of  the  most 
Strongly   positive  metals,  by    ration    in   the   metallic   state    upon  the 
acid  : 

K    4  2HCN  =  2KCN  +  I 

yet  by  use  of  the  hydrates,  in  some  cases  also  of  the  O-xides,  they  can 
be  prepared  without  difficulty  : 

HgO  +  L'lKX  =  1L  I!  <). 

The  insoluble  metallic  cyanides  are  best  prepared  by  double  de- 
composition between  the  soluble  alkaline  cyanides,  and  soluble  sail- of 
the  respective  metals. 

The    cyanides    of  the    different    metallic   groups   differ  from  one 
another  very  essentially  i;.  some  of  their  properties.     Whilst  tip  - 
the  most  positive  metals  (the  alkalies  and  alkaline   earths)  are  easily 
soluble  in  water,  are  of  strongly  alkaline  reaction,  are  decomposed  by 


METALLIC   CYANIDES.  63 

the  weakest  mineral  acids,  even  carbonic,  and  are  not  decomposed  by 
a  red  heat  if  air  be  absent ;  those  of  the  less  positive  metals  (the 
heavy  metals)  are  mostly  insoluble,  or  difficultly  soluble  in  water,  and 
are  decomposed  by  a  high  temperature.  Some  of  these  latter  cyanides, 
more  especially  those  of  the  noble  metals  (mercury,  silver,  <fcc,  partly 
also  Cu  and  Zn),  simply  decompose  into  the  metal  and  cyanogen, 
which  in  great  part  comes  off  as  gas,  whilst  the  others,  especially 
those  of  the  iron  group,  are  decomposed  on  ignition,  nitrogen  being 
evolved,  and  a  compound  of  the  metal  with  carbon  left  behind. 

The  cyanides  of  the  heavy  metals  mostly  combine  with  those  of 
the  alkalies,  forming  compounds  soluble  in  water.  In  these  double 
cyanides  very  frequently  the  less  positive  heavy  metal  is  apparently 
more  firmly  united  than  the  more  positive,  and  cannot  be  recognised 
by  its  usual  tests  ;  when  treated  with  mineral  acids  these  compounds 
yield  no  hydrocyanic  acid,  or  give  up  their  cyanogen  only  partially  in 
that  form,  whilst  hyclric  metallic  cyanides  of  acid  character  result;  e.g. 
potassic  ferrocyanide  yields,  with  hydrochloric  acid,  potassic  chloride 
and  hydroferrocyanic  acid  : 

K4FeC6N6  +  4HC1  =  4KC1  +  H4FeC6N6. 

In  such  double  cyanides  heavy  metals  can  replace  the  alkali 
metal,  and  such  replacing  metals  are  still  recognisable  by  their  ordi- 
nary reagents. 

These  double  cyanides  can  only  result  from  the  polymerisation  of 
the  cyanogen  group,  in  some  the  dicyanogen,  in  others  the  tricyanogen 
group  occurring. 

Some  metallic  cyanides  doubtless  contain  true  cyanogen — that  is, 
the  metal  united  to  carbon — whilst  others  appear  to  be  entirely  iso- 
cyanides ;  to  the  latter  class  probably  belong  the  cyanides  of  those 
metals  which  combine  readily  with  nitrogen,  especially  those  which 
yield  amid-compounds  with  ammonia. 

79.  Potassic  Cyanide,  KCy  or  K — C=N. — Although  potassic 
cyanide  can  be  directly  prepared,  still  it  is  generally  obtained  from 
dried  potassic  ferrocyanide,  which  is  heated  to  quiet  fusion,  without 
access  of  air  : 

K4FeC6N6  =  4KCN  +  FeC2  +  N2. 

The  carbide  of  iron  settles  to  the  bottom,  and  the  clear  supernatant 
liquid  can  be  poured  off.  Such  potassic  cyanide  as  remains  with  the 
residue  can  be  obtained  by  pulverisation  and  extraction  with  boiling 
alcohol ;  the  filtered  liquid  crystallises  on  cooling. 

It  can  be  obtained  in  larger  quantity,  and  of  sufficient  purity  for 
most  purposes,  by  heating  a  mixture  of  eight  parts  of  dried  potassic 
ferrocyanide  with  three  parts  of  dried  potassic  carbonate  to  low  red- 
ness in  an  iron  crucible.  By  this  means  one-half  of  the  cyanogen, 
which  would  be  lost  but  for  the  addition  of  the  potash,  is  obtained  as 
potassic  cyanide,  the  other  half  as  potassic  cyanate,  which  latter 
remains  mixed  with  the  cyanide  ;  instead  of  ferric  carbide,  Bpongy 
iron  results,  from  which  the  melted  salt  is  easily  separated  mechani- 
cally : 

K4Fe(CGN6)  +  K2COa  =  5K(CN)  +  KCNO  +  CO,  +  Fe. 


(54  CYANOGEN   COMPOUNDS. 

A  still  better  result  is  obtained  when  charcoal  is  also  added  to  the 
fusion,  and  the  mixture  strongly  heated,  the  carbon  reducing  a  large 
quantity  of  cyanatc  to  cyanide  of  potassium  : 

K4Fe(C6N6)  +  K2C03  +  G  =  6K(CN)  +  CO,  +  CO  +  Fe. 

The  purest  potassic  cyanide  is  obtained  by  passing  the  vapour  of 
anhydrous  hydrocyanic  acid  into  a  solution  of  potassic  hydrate  in 
absolute  alcohol,  the  salt  separating  in  the  crystalline  form. 

Potassic  cyanide  is  a  colourless,  highly  poisonous  body,  crystallis- 
ing from  solution  in  octahedra,  from  fusion  in  cubes  ;  at  a  red  heat  it 
fuses  to  a  clear  liquid,  it  deliquesces  in  damp  air,  and — through  its 
slow  decomposition  by  the  carbonic  acid  of  the  air — smells  of  hydro- 
cyanic acid.  Its  aqueous  solution  reacts  .strongly  alkaline.  It  is 
more  soluble  in  dilute  than  in  strong  alcohol.  It  decomposes  easily 
in  aqueous  solution,  especially  on  boiling,  into  potassic  formate  and 
ammonia  :

When  fused  in  contact  with  air,  it  absorbs  oxygen,  and  is  con- 
verted into  cyanate.  It  undergoes  the  same  change  when  heated  with 
metallic  oxides,  and  i.>  therefore  one  of  the  most  powerful  reducing 
agents,  e.g. 

S02  +  2KCN  =  S  +  2KCNO. 

The  cyanides  of  the  other  alkali  metals  resemble  that  of  potassium  in 
nearly  all  particulars.

heating  an  intimate  mixture  of  potassic  cyanide  and  sal  ammoniac. 
It  crystallises  in  colourless  cubes,  which  are  very  soluble  in  alcohol. 
It  boils  at  +  36°  with  dissociation  into  hydrocyanic  acid  and  am- 
monia, which  re-combine  on  reduction  of  temperature.  It  is  at 
poisonous  as  prussic  acid  and  potassic  cyanide.  On  keeping,  it  de- 
composes, with  formation  of  a  blackish  brown  mass  (azulmine). 

The  formation  of  ammonic  cyanide  by  passing  ammonia  gas  over 
glowing  carbon : 

3C  +  4NH3  =  2(ON.NH4)  +  CH,  : 

or  by  passing  ammonia  and  carbonic  oxide  through  red-hot  tubes : 

CO  +  l>NH3  =  CN.NH4  +  H20; 

is  of  considerable  theoretical  interest.  As  ammonic  cyanide  is  ob- 
tained by  the  destructive  distillation  of  nitrogenous  organic  bodies,  it 
occurs,  often  in  considerable  quantity,  as  a  constituent  of  the  wash- 
water  of  gas-works. 

81.  Cyanide*  of  the  alkaline  >  earths — i.e.  of  barium,  strontium,  and 
calcium — can  be  prepared  directly,  but  are  best  obtained  by  ignition  of 
the  respective  ferrocyanides,  or  by  action  of  hydrocyanic  acid  on  their 


METALLIC   CYANIDES.  65 

hydrates.     They  are  more  difficultly  soluble  than  the  foregoing,  react 
alkaline,  and  are  very  easily  decomposed  by  carbonic  acid. 

82.  Zincic  cyanide,  ZnC2N2  =  Zn(CN)2,  is  obtained  as  a  white 
insoluble  powder,  by  addition  of  hydrocyanic  acid  to  zincic  acetate, 
or  of  potassic  cyanide  to  any  other  zinc  salt.  It  is  decomposed  by 
acids  with  evolution  of  hydrocyanic  acid,  is  readily  soluble  in  excess 
of  potassic  cyanide,  the  solution  yielding  on  evaporation  octahedral 
crystals  of  potassic  zincic  cyanide  : 


K2ZnC4N4  =  Zn<jg^j| 


The  cyanogen  compounds  of  cadmium  and  indium  are  quite  similar  ; 
from  the  double  cyanides  the  metals  are  precipitated  by  sulphuretted 
hydrogen,  as  in  the  case  of  the  ordinary  salts. 

Indium  cyanide,  however,  is  distinguished  from  the  others  by  its 
easy  decomposition  on  boiling  with  water,  indium  hydrate  being 
formed  : 

In(CN)2  +  2H20  =  In(OH)2  +  2HCK 

83.  Nickclous  cyanide,  Ni(CN)2,  is  obtained  similarly  to  the 
zinc  salt,  as  an  apple-green  precipitate ;  it  is  easily  dissolved  by  an 
aqueous  solution  of  potassic  cyanide  to  a  yellow  solution,  which  by 
evaporation  yields  monoclinic  prisms  of  potassic  nickelous  cyanide, 

KoNiC4N4,OH2   or   Ni<^2^2)5>OH2.     From    solutions    of    this 

salt,  nickelous  cyanide  is  re- precipitated  by  careful  addition  of  hydro- 
chloric acid  ;  excess  of  acid  decomposes  it.     By  boiling  the  solution 
with  mercuric  oxide,  nickelous  oxide  is  precipitated,    and  pot 
mercuric  cyanide  formed. 

84.  C ya  hi Ides  of  Cobalt. — By  careful  addition  of  potassic  cyanide 
to  a  cobaltous  salt,  a  reddish-brown  precipitate  of  cobaltous  cyanide 
is  obtained,  which  dissolves  readily  in  an  excess  of  the  precipitant. 
From  this  solution  alcohol  precipitates  potassic  cobaltous  cyanide, 
K4Co(CGN()),  which  crystallises  in  deep  red,  deliquescent  needles. 
Exposed  to  air  it  ciunly  absorbs  oxygen,  and  is  converted  into  potassic 
cobalticvanide,  which  is  also  formed  with  evolution  of  hydrogen  on 
boiling  the  solution : 

2K4Co(C6N6)  +  2H20  =  K6Co,(elaNia)  +  2KOH  +  H2, 

as  also  by  heating  freshly  precipitated  cobaltous  hydrate  with  pot 

cyanide  solution  : 

L2KCN  +  2Co(OH)2  +  2H20  =  K6Co2(C12N12)  -f  6KOH  +  H8. 

Potassic  cobalticyanicU  crystallises  in  clear  yellow  crystals,  iso- 
niorphous  with  those  ofpotassic  fen  icyaiiide  (866 later),  which  dissolve 
easily  in  water,  and  on  ignition  decompose  into  potassic  cyanide, 
cyanogen,  nitrogen,  and  cobalt  carbide.  The  cobalt  in  this  compound 
cannot  be  recognised  by  any  of  its  usual  reagents.  <  >n  adding  a 
slight  excess  of  sulphuric  acid  to  a  concentrated  solution  of  this  salt, 

and  then  much  alcohol,  potassic  sulphate  separates,  and  the  alcoholic 
liquid  yields,  on  evaporation,   colourless    needles  of  hydrOCobaUicyamic 

acid,  H6Co2Cy12,H20,  which  loses  its  water  of  crystallisation  at  100  .

deliquesces  in  the  air,  reacts  strongly  acid,  and  not  only  decomposes 
carbonates,  but  dissolves  zinc  and  iron  with  evolution  of  hydrogen. 
The  difference  in  behaviour  of  nickel  and  cobalt  salts  with  potassic 
cyanide,  is  made  use  of  in  the  quantitative  separation  of  these  metals. 

By  saturation  of  hydrocobalticyanic  acid  with  carlxmates  or  hy- 
drates of  metals,  or  by  double  decomposition  of  salts  of  heavy  metals, 
and  solutions  of  potassic  cobalticyanide,  metallic  cobalticyanides  are 
obtained. 

The  probable  constitutional  formula?  of  the  cobalticyanides  would 
represent  them  as  containing  tri-cyanogen  groups;  for  instance,  hydro- 
cobalticyanic acid  may  be  written  : 

Co<(C3N3)H 
Co<(C3N3)H2 

85.  Cyanides  of  Iron. — Simple  cyanides  of  this  metal,  correspond- 
ing to  the  chlorides,  are  almost  unknown.  By  precipitation  of  a 
ferrous  salt  with  potassic  cyanide,  a  rust-coloured  body  is  obtained, 
soluble  in  hydrochloric  acid,  which  appears  to  be  ferrous  cyanide.  On 
mixing  a  ferric  salt  witli  potassic  cyanide  solution,  the  liquid  at  first 
remains  clear,  and  may  in  this  state  contain  ferric  cyanide ;  but  it 
soon  deposits  ferric  hydrate,  with  evolution  of  hydrocyanic  acid,  and 
contains,  when  an  excess  of  potassic  cyanide  was  employed,  together 
with  that  salt,  potassic  ferrocyanide,  K,FeC6N6.  This  latter  com- 
pound results  also  when  ferrous  salts  are  mixed  with  a  large  excess  of 
potassic  cyanide,  and  is  obtained  in  crystals  on  evaporating  the 
liquid. 

86.  TTi/rfro-fei-rocyayiicAcid,  H4Fe(06]S'6). — If  a  concentrated  solu- 
tion of  .potassic  ferrocyanide  be  acidulated  with  strong  hydrochloric 
acid,  colourless  leafy  crystals  of  hydro-ferrocyanic  acid  separate,  whose 
quantity  is  greatly  increased  on  addition  of  ether  to  the  liquid. 

It  is  soluble  in  water  and  alcohol,  insoluble  in  ethar,  and  on  ad- 
dition of  excess  of  ether,  to  an  alcoholic  solution,  is  obtained  in  large 
crystals,  colourless  if  air  be  completely  excluded.  In  the  air  it 
quickly  decomposes  by  oxidation,  with  blue  colouration ;  it  reacts  and 
tastes  strongly  acid,  decomposes  carbonates,  and  forms  the  respective 
ferrocyanides  with  iron  and  zinc,  hydrogen  being  evolved.  In  both 
acid  and  salts  the  iron  is  completely  masked,  i.e.  not  recognisable  by 
its  usual  reagents. 

In  hydro-ferrocyanic  acid  also  the  cyanogen  is  probably  in  the 
form  of  bicyanogen,  and  the  rational  formula  of  the  compound  will 
therefore  be  : 

Fe/(C3N3)<« 
X(C3N3)<g 

In  the  ferrocyanides  the  hydrogen  is  replaced  by  metals,  fee. 

87.  Potassic  Ferrocyanide,  K4Fe(C6N"6),3H20. — This  important 
salt,  known  in  commerce  as  yellow  jwssiate,  was  first  obtained  by 


METALLIC  CYANIDES.  67 

washing  carbonised  blood.  It  crystallises  in  yellow  quadratic  pyra- 
mids, with  basal  faces  most  developed,  with  marked  cleavage,  parallel 
to  the  latter,  into  somewhat  pliable  lamina?.  It  is  unalterable  in  air ; 
100  parts  of  water  dissolve  in  the  cold  25  parts  of  the  salt,  at  the 
boiling  temperature  about  double  as  much.  On  gentle  heating  the 
crystals  lose  their  water  and  become  white  and  opaque.  The  decom- 
position on  strong  ignition  has  already  been  referred  to  (§  79). 

The  salt  is  formed  on  the  large  scale  by  introducing  animal 
charcoal  (from  blood,  horn,  leather  parings,  <kc.)  and  iron  into  fused 
pearlash  (potassic  carbonate).  On  strong  ignition  potassic  cyanide  is 
formed  with  evolution  of  gas  : 

K2C03  +  4C  +  2N  =  300  +  2KCN, 

and  from  the  sulphates  in  the  pearlash  and  the  iron,  ferrous  sulphide 
is  formed.  The  cooled  '  melt '  is  heated  with  hot  water,  whereby, 
according  to  the  equation 

6KCN  +  FeS  =  K2S  +  K4FeC6N6, 

potassic  ferrocyanide  results,  which  is  obtained  on  evaporation  of  the 
liquid  in  well-formed  crystals,  and  is  purified  by  re-crystallisation. 

88.  With  salts  of  the  heavy  metals,  potassic  ferrocyanide  generally 
yields  amorphous,  insoluble  precipitates  of  the  ferrocyanides ;  if  the 
metallic  solution  be  in  excess  all  the  potassium  is  replaced  : 

2CuS04  +  K4Fe(C3N3)2  =  2K2S04  +  Cu2Fe(C3N3)2, 

whilst,  on  the  contrary,  by  careful  addition  of  the  metalbc  salt  to 
potassic  feiTOcyanide  precipitates  are  obtained,  in  which  the  potas- 
sium is  only  partly  replaced  : 

CuS04  +  K4Fe(C3lSr3)2  =  K2S04  +  K2CuFe(C3N3)2. 

By  boiling  with  potassic  hydrate  solution,  the  insoluble  metallic 
ferrocyanides  are  converted  into  potassic  ferrocyanide,  and  the  insoluble 
hydrate  or  oxide  of  the  metal : 

Cu2Fe(C3N3)2  -H  4K0H  =  K4Fe(C3N3)2  +  2Cu0  -f  .20H2. 

If  other  alkalies  or  alkaline  earths  be  employed,  the  ferrocyanide^ 
of  these  metals  result  : 

Cu2Fe(C3N3)2  +  2Ba(HO)2  =  Ba2Fe(C3N3)2  +  2CuO  +  20H2. 

89.  Sodic ferrocyanide,  Na4Fe(C3N3)2,120H2,  crystallises  in  yel- 
low,  monoclinic,  readily  soluble  crystals,  which  effloresce  on  exposure 
to  air. 

A  mmonic  ferrocyanide,  (NH4)4Fe(C3N3)2,3H20,  is  isoinorphous 
with  the  potassium  salt. 

Baric  ferrocyanide,  Ba2Fe(C3N3)2,6H20,  is  difficultly  soluble  in 
cold  water;  somewhat  more  readily  soluble  are  Sr2Fe(C3N3)2,150H2, 
Ca2Fe(C3N3)2,12H20,  and  MgaFe(C,tf3)8,10HaO. 

Of  the  insoluble  ferrocyanides  t>f  the  heavy  metals,  the  following 
may  be  shortly  noticed  : 

Zincic  ferrocyanide,  Zn2Fe(03N3)2,3H20,  is  a  white  amorphous 
precipitate,  as  is  also  the  cadinie  salt.

plumbic  ferrocyanide,  Pb2Fe(C3N3)2,3H20,  and  argentic  ferrocyanide,

On  mixing  a  soluble  ferrocyanide  with  a  ferrous  salt,  with 
total  exclusion  of  oxygen,  white  precipitates  of  ferrous  ferrocyanide, 
Fe2Fe(C3N3)2,  and  potassic  ferrous  ferrocyanide,  FeK2Fe(C3N3)2,  are 
obtained.  The  latter  compound  is  always  formed  in  the  preparation 
of  hydrocyanic  acid  by  heating  potassic  ferrocyanide  with  dilute  sul- 
phuric acid  (§  74).  Both  bodies  on  treatment  with  potassic  hydrate 
give  potassic  ferrocyanide  with  separation  of  ferrous  hydrate  : 

K2Fe.Fe(C3N3)2  +  2KOH  =  K4Fe(C3N3)2  +  Fe(OH)2, 

and  oxidise  with  great  readiness  on  exposure  to  air,  yielding  blue 
ferric  ferrocyanide. 

When  poured  into  solutions  of  ferric  salts,  potassic  ferrocyanide 
gives  a  beautiful  blue  precipitate  of  ferric  ferrocyanide,  or  Prussian 
blue :

Prussian  blue  is  a  deep  blue  powder,  which,  when  air-dried,  still 
contains  more  than  20%  of  water  \  when  strongly  compressed,  and 
especially  by  rubbing  with  hard  polished  substances,  it  shows  on  the 
surface  a  copper-red  metallic  lustre.  It  is  insoluble  in  water,  alcohol, 
dilute  acids,  &c,  but  is  dissolved  by  oxalic  acid,  and  by  ammonic 
acetate  to  blue  solutions  (blue  ink).  By  boiling  with  alkalies  it  is 
re-converted  into  alkaline  ferrocyanides,  ferric  hydrate  separating  : 

(Fe2)2.3[Fe(C3N3)2]  +  12KHO  =  3K4Fe(C3N3)2  +  2Fe2(OH)6. 

When  excess  of  potassic  ferrocyanide  is  gradually  mixed  with  a 
ferric  solution,  the  so-called  soluble  Prussian  blue  is  formed  ;  a  ferric 
potassic  ferrocyanide,  of  unknown  composition,  which  is  insoluble  in 
bydrochloric  acid,  but  soluble  in  pure  water  to  a  deep  blue  liquid. 

91-  Potassic  Ferricyanide,  or  Red  Prussiate,  KGFe2C12^io

sic ferrocyanide  until  a  portion  of  the  liquid  no  longer  gives  a  blue 
precipitate  with  ferric  chloride,  and  the  solution  evaporated  to  crys- 
tallisation, potassic  ferricyanide  crystallises  out  in  large,  shining  red, 
rhombic  prisms,  the  salt  b^ing  formed  according  to  the  equation  : 

2K4Fe(C3N3)2  +  Cl2  =  2K01  +  K6Fe2(C3N3)4. 

Longer  treatment  with  chlorine  decomposes  the  ferricyanide.

as  a  powerful  oxidising  agent,  being  itself  reduced  to  feirocyanide ;

Potassic  ferricyanide  dissolves  in  3'8  parts  of  cold,  more  readily  in  hot 
water  j  it  precipitates  the  solutions  of  most  salts  of  the  heavy  metals, 
the  latter  replacing  the  potassium.  A  large  number  of  the  resulting 
insoluble  i\  n  icyanides  are  characteristic,  but  others  are  the  same 
colours  as  the  ferrocyanides.  The  zinc  and  cadmium  compounds  are 
more  or  less  deep  yellow  precipitates,  soluble  in  dilute  hydrochloric 
acid  ;  of  similar  colour,  but  insoluble  in  HC1,  are  nickelous  and  cupric 
ferricyanides  ;  cobaltous  and  manganous  ferricyanidt  s  ai  e  dark  brown, 
argentic  ferricyanide  is  a  rust-brown  precipitate. 

On  addition  of  ferrous  salts  to  potassic  ferricyanide  solution,  a 
precipitate  of  ferrous  ferricyanide  (Turnbull's  blue),  similar  to  Prussian 
blue  in  appearance,  is  obtained  : 

K6Fe2(C3N3)4  +  3FeS04  =  3K2S04  +  Fe3Fe2(C3N3)1. 

When  insoluble  metallic  ferricyanides  are  heated  with  alkalies,  the 
oxides  are  separated, and  alkaline  and  iron  cyanogen  compounds  formed ; 
the  latter  are  ferricyanides  if  the  resulting  oxide  be  not  further  oxi- 
disable  : 

Zn3Fe2(C3N3)4  +  6KOH  =  KGFe2(C3N3)4  +  3Zn(OH)2, 

whilst,  on  the  other  hand,  if  the  metal  admits  of  further  oxidation, 
this  ensues  with  reduction  of  the  ferricyanide  to  ferrocyanide  : 

Fe3Fe2(C3N3)4  +  8KOH  =  K6Fe2(C3N3)4  +  3Fe(OH),  +  2KOH 
=  2K4Fe(C3N3)2  +  Fe2(OH)6  +  Fe(OH)2. 

The  soluble  ferricyanides  are  not  precipitated  by  ferric  or  chromic 

salts,  as  the  respective  ferricyanides  are  soluble  in  water: 

K„Fe2(C3N3)4  +  Fe2Cl6  =  GKC1  +  Fe2.Fe2(C3N3)4. 

On  mixing  concentrated  solutions  of  potassic  ferricyanide  and 
plumbic  nitrate,  heavy,  soluble,  dark  crystals  of  plumbic  ferricyanide 
slowly  separate.  When  these  crystals  are  decomposed  by  a  not  quite 
equivalent  quantity  of  sulphuric  acid,  the  liquid  decanted  from  the 
precipitate  of  plumbic  sulphate  contains  hydrqferricyanic  acid, 
H6Fe2(C3!N'3).,,  which,  by  careful  evaporation  in  the  cold,  yields  brown- 
coloured  needles,  easily  soluble,  strongly  acid,  and  poisonoua  Their 
solution  gives  with  ferrous  salts  a  blue  precipitate,  and  decompps

94.  Cy ankles  of  Copper. — A  cyanide  of  copper  of  the  formula 
Cu(CN)2  is  not  obtainable  in  the  pure  state  ;  an  impure  preparation  is 
formed  by  addition  of  potassic  cyanide  to  solution  of  cupric  sulphate, 
or  of  cupric  acetate  to  hydrocyanic  acid,  as  a  dirty  yellowish-brown 
precipitate,  but  this  very  quickly  decomposes,  with  evolution  of  cyano- 
gen, into  green  crystals  of  cuprous  cupric  cyani 

Cu(C2X2)x 
Cu3X4C4,5HoO  =  >Cu.5HoO 

Cu(C,X2/ 

In  boiling  water  this  is  readily  further  decomposed  into  cyanogen  and 
cuprous  cyanide,  Cu.2(L'X)2  =  CN — Cu — Cu — CN. 

Cuprous  cyanide  is  a  white  powder,  insoluble  in  water,  easily 
soluble  in  hydrochloric  acid,  ammonia,  or  aqueous  potassic  cyanide. 
With  the  latter  it  forms  crystalline,  colourless,  double  salts  of  different 
composition,  namelv  : 

Cu— (C2N,)K 
K.2Cu2C4N4    =    | 

Cu— (C2>~2)K 

which  is  difficultly  soluble,  and  the  more  soluble  K6Cu2C8N8,  from 
which  sulphuretted  hydrogen  does  not  precipitate  the  copper.  These 
double  salts  are  also  obtained  when  solutions  of  cupric  salts  are  mixed 
with  excess  of  potassic  cyanide. 

From  plumbic  cupro-cyanide  (obtained  by  precipitation  of  pot, 
cupro-cyanide    with  plumbic  acetate)  the  compound  H.2Cu.2C4N4    is 
obtained   by  decomposition    with  sulphuretted  hydrogen;  it  readily 
decomposes  into  cuprous  cyanide  and  hydrocyanic  acid. 

95.  Of  the  cyanogen  compounds  of  mercury,  that  one  corre- 
sponding to  calomel  is  not  known  :  when  potassic  cyanide  is  added  to 
a  niercurous  salt,  metallic  mercury  is  precipitated,  and  mercuric 
cyanide  left  in  solution  : 

Hg2(N03)2  +  2KCN  =  2KNO,  +  Hg  +  Hg(CX)2. 

Mercuric  cyanide  is  prepared  by  dissolving  yellow  mercuric  oxide  in 
aqueous  hydrocyanic  acid,  the  former  being  used  in  slight  excess.  It  is 
also  easily  obtained  by  boiling  Prussian  blue  with  mercuric  oxide, 
until  all  the  iron  is  precipitated  as  oxide.  At  ordinary  temperatures 
one  part  of  Hg(CN)9  is  soluble  in  eight  parts  of  water.  It  crystallises 
in  large  brilliant  quadratic  prisms,  which  are  extremely  poisonous  :  on 
heating  it  splits  up  into  metal,  and  cyanogen  gas.  a  portion  of  which 
remains  polymerised  as  paracyanogen,  a  blackish-brown  powder. 

Mercuric  cyanide  yields  with  the  alkaline  cyanides  beautiful 
crystalline  double  salts,  e.g. 

K,HgC4>-4  =  B«<jSg|* 

which  crystallises  in  colourless  octahedra.

chloride  and  evaporating,  quadratic  prisma  separate,  of  rm  rcuric  cyano-

Mercuric  cyanide  also  combines  with  many  metallic  chlorides, 
bromides,  and  iodide-,  forming  doable  silts,  most  of  which  crystallise

The  behaviour  of  argentic  cyanide  toward-  potassLc  cyanide  yields 
a  method  of  sufficient  accuracy  for  the  estimation  of  hydrocyanic 
or  potassio  cyanide.  For  this  purpose  s  measured  quantity  of  the 
liquid  under  examination  is  taken  and  converted,  it'  needful,  into 
potassio  cyanide,  by  addition  of  potassic  hydrate  Dilute  standard 
Solution  of  argentic  nitrate  is  then  added  slowly  :    at    first  there  is   no 

precipitate,  potassic  argentic  cyanide  being  formed  until  one-half  of 

the  cyanogen  is  converted  into  argentic  cyanide  : 

2KCN  +  AgN0,=  KNO,  +  K.A 

as  soon,  however,  as  by  addition  of  silver  solution  this  point   is 


METALLIC  CYANIDES.  73 

stepped,  every  drop  added  produces  a  permanent  precipitate  of  argentic 
cyanide  : 

KAg(C2N2)  +  AgN03  =  2Ag(CN)  +  KN03. 

The  quantity  of  silver  solution  used  up  to  this  point  corresponds 
therefore  in  equivalents  to  half  the  quantity  of  hydrocyanic  acid  pre- 
sent. As  a  rule,  a  decinormal  solution  of  argentic  nitrate  is  employed ; 
this  is  prepared  by  dissolving  17*0  grams  of  argentic  nitrate  (an 
equivalent  in  -^  grams)  to  one  litre  of  solution  (  =  0*017  grams  AgN03 
per  c.c),  and  this  is  delivered  drop  by  drop  until  the  precipitate  formed 
does  not  disappear  on  shaking.  The  number  of  c.c.  used  multiplied 
by  *0054  gives  the  amount  in  grams  of  prussic  acid  present  (equivalent 
of  HCN  =  27  and  27  x  2  =  54),  by  -013  the  amount  of  potassic  cy- 
anide. 

97.  Cyanides  of  Gold. — Aurous  cyanide,  Au(CN),  a  yellow  powder 
consisting  of  microscopical  hexagonal  tables,  insoluble  in  water,  is  best 
obtained  by  decomposition  with  hydrochloric  acid,  of  its  double  salt 
with  potassic  cyanide.  Potassic  aurocyanide  is  easily  prepared  by 
solution  of  the  oxide  or  sulphide  in  potassic  cyanide,  as  also  by  long 
standing  of  finely  divided  gold  in  potassic  cyanide  solution,  air  being 
excluded.     It  forms  long  colourless  prisms  easily  soluble  in  water. 

Potassic  auricyanide,  KAu(C£T)4,   H20  or  Au^-CN  >OH2, 

\(C2N2)K 

is  obtained  by  mixing  a  neutral  solution  of  auric  chloride  with  a  boil- 
ing concentrated  solution  of  potassic  cyanide;  on  cooling  large  colourless 
crystals  are  formed.  The  dilute  aqueous  solution  generally  obtained 
by  mixing  auric  chloride  and  dilute  potassic  cyanide  solution,  is 
employed  in  electro-gi]ding. 

When  a  solution  of  potassic  auricyanide  is  added  to  argentic 
nitrate,  a  curdy  precipitate  of  argentic  auricyanide  is  obtained, 
which,  suspended  in  water,  and  decomposed  by  a  slightly  insufficient 
quantity  of  hydrochloric  acid,  yields  a  solution  of  hydroauricyanic 
acid ;  by  evaporation  of  the  filtered  solution  in  vacuo,  large  tabular 
crystals  of  auric  cyanide,  Au(CN)3,3H20,  are  obtained. 

98.  Cyanides  of  Platinum. — Platinous  chloride  dissolves  readily  in 
aqueous  potassic  cyanide ;  on  evaporation,  potassic  platinocyanide 
crystallises  out : 

PtCl2  +  4K(CN)  =  2KC1  +  K2Pt(C4N4). 

It  is  also  formed  when  a  mixture  of  platinic  chloride  and  potassic 
cyanide  are  boiled  together  for  a  long  time  : 

PtCl4  +  6KCN  =  K2Pt(C4N4)  +  C2N2  +  4KC1, 

or  when  spongy  platinum  is  fused  with  potassic  cyanide  or  ferro- 
cyanide,  the  product  extracted  with  water,  and  the  solution  crystallised. 

(C  N.  )K 
Potassic  platinocyanide,  Pt<Qp'2^r2/-K-,3H20,    forms   long   prisms,

By  double  decomposition  other  metallic  platinocyanides  are  obtained 
from  this,  which  when  crystallised  show  splendid  fluorescent  pheno- 
mena ;  for  instance  :

CYANIC  ACIDS.  75 

The  same  compound  is  obtained  directly  by  pouring  anhydrous 
prussic  acid  into  a  flask  filled  with  chlorine,  and  then  exposing  to 
sunlight ;  or  when  a  slow  stream  of  chlorine  is  passed  into  a  solution 
of  anhydrous  prussic  acid  in  four  times  its  volume  of  ether,  which  is 
carefully  cooled. 

Solid  cyanogen  chloride  crystallises  in  large  needles  or  leaves,  which 
melt  at  145°  ;  the  boiling  point  is  about  190°,  the  vapour  density  = 
6*33,  being  three  times  that  of  the  single  cyanogen  chloride. 

By  decomposition  of  potassic  or  mercuric  cyanides  by  bromine, 
cyanogen  bromide,  Br— G=N,  is  obtained  in  the  form  of  shining 
colourless  needles  or  cubes,  which  easily  volatilise.  When  these, 
either  alone  or  dissolved  in  ether,  are  heated  in  sealed  glass  tubes  to 
130°-140°  for  several  hours,  they  are  converted  into  : 

Tricyanogen  tribromide,  which  melts  at  a  little  above  300°,  and 
sublimes  at  a  still  higher  temperature. 

Cyanogen  iodide,  I — CiEEN",  crystallises  in  colourless  needles, 
which  sublimes  easily,  without  previous  fusion,  with  a  strong  odour, 
and,  like  the  above-mentioned  compounds,  is  very  poisonous.  It  is 
obtained  by  sublimation  of  a  mixture  of  mercuric  cyanide  and  iodine. 
On  adding  iodine  to  a  pretty  concentrated  solution  of  potassic  cyanide, 
the  liquid  colours  quickly  and  solidifies  to  a  crystalline  mass  : 

KCN  4-  I2  =  KI  +  ICN, 

from  which  the  ICN  is  obtained  by  shaking  with  ether. 


Cyanic  Acids. 

100.  The   true   cyanic   acid   has   the   constitution    of    cyanogen 
hydrate  : 

H— O— C=N; 

to  this  there  would  be  a  corresponding  pseudo-cyanogen  compound, 
carboxylimide  : 

0=C=N—  H. 

Which  of  these  is  the  formula  of  the  known  cyanic  acid  is  not  yet  quite 
certain,  though  there  are  good  reasons  for  believing  the  first  to  be 
correct.  On  the  other  hand,  two  potassium  derivatives,  (CN)OK  and 
(CO)NK,  are  known,  which,  though  clearly  different,  easily  change 
into  one  another. 

The  same  is  generally  true  of  the  polymeric  acids,  especially  of 
tricyanic  or  cyanuric  acid. 

101.  Cyanic  Acid,  HCNO,  probably  CEEEN. — Cyanic  acid  can  only 

\ 

OH 

be  obtained  by  strong  heating  of  the  polymeric  cyanuric  acid.  This 
is  done  in  a  small  retort,  and  the  resulting  vapour  condensed  in 
a  receiver  cooled  with  ice.  It  is  a  colourless,  easily  volatile  liquid, 
of  strongly  acid  reaction,  smells  like  concentrated  acetic  acid,  and 
blisters  the  skin.  Left  to  itself,  it  clouds  with  slowly  increasing  tem- 
perature, and  finally  solidifies,  with  stronger  evolution  of  heat,  to  a 
white  porcelain-like  mass,   called  cyamdide.     This  is  a  polymer  of 


76  CYANOGEN   COMPOUNDS. 

cyanic  acid,  but  of  unknown  molecular  weight ;  it  has  no  longer  the 
properties  of  an  acid;  by  strong  heating  it  is  re-converted  into  cyanic 
acid. 

When  cyanic  acid  is  mixed  with  water  at  the  ordinary  tem- 
perature they  soon  react,  with  evolution  of  heat,  forming  hydric- 
ammonic  carbonate,  so  that  the  first  acid  reaction  is  quickly  changed 
to  alkaline : 

CNHO  +  2H20  =  NH4.HC03 

/O.NH4 
C=N  +  2H20  =  I      O 

\  \OH 

OH 

At  0°  this  reaction  only  takes  place  very  slowly. 

With  the  basic  hydrates  cyanic  acid  yields  salts  of  neutral  reaction, 
an liicli  require  re-investigation  for  the  proper  determination  of  their 
structure. 

102.  PotaMxc  Gyanate. — (a)  Ordinary  potaasic  cyanate,  or  probably 
pseudo-cyanate,  0=C=N — K,  is  formed  by  the  oxidation  of  fused 
potaasio  cyanide  by  the  air,  or  by  metallic  oxides.  Usually  potaasic 
cyanide  is  melted  and  dry  plumbic  oxide,  or  minium,  added,  stirring 
until  gas  bubbles  begin  to  appear  : 

KCN  +  PbO  =  KCXO  +  Pb. 

Another  method  is  to  mix  dried  potassic  ferrocyanide  with  half  its 
weight  of  pyrolusite,  and  heat  on  an  iron  plate  until  the  mass  Boftens. 
The  '  melt '  is  then  treated  with  boiling  hydrated  alcohol  (80%) ;  from 
this  solution  the  salt  crystallises  on  cooling  in  colourless  indistinct 
needles  or  leaves.  It  dissolves  easily  in  water,  difficultly  in  strong 
alcohol.   Boiled  with  water  it  yields  potaasic  and  amnionic  carbon

This  cyanate,  prepared  by  fusion,  doubtless  consists,  at  least  in 
great  part,  of  isocyanate,  as  by  replacement  of  the  potassium  by  hydro- 
carbon radicals,  the  isocyanic  ethers  result;  for  instance,  G<C\'    " 

in  which  the  organic  radical  is  united  to  the  nitrogen.

OK 
together   with   potassic  chloride,  by  passing  cyanogen  chloride  into 
potassic  hydrate,  the  temperature  being  kept  as  low  as  possible  : 

CI— C^N  +  2KOH  =  KOC=N  +  KC1  +  ll.fi  ; 

it  crystallises  in  long  needles,  and  is  converted  by  fusion  into  the 
foregoing,  from  which  it  is  distinguished  by  its  convertibility  into 
dicvandiamide  (§   115). 

On  endeavouring  to  liberate  the  acid  from  either  of  these  salts,  or 
from  other  metallic  cyanates,  by  addition  of  strong  mineral  acids — for 
instance,  sulphuric  acid  — carbonic  anhydride  is  liberated    with  elltr-

vescence,  whilst  the  acid  sulphates  of  the  respective  metal,  and  of 
ammonium  results  : 

K— N=C=0  +  2H2S04  +  H20  =  C02  +  KHS04  +  (NH4)HS04. 

K_0_C=N  +  2H2S04  +  H20  =  C02  +  KHS04  +  (NH4)HS04. 

Ordinary  potassic  cyanide  gives  in  aqueous  solution  white  precipi- 
tates with  the  solutions  of  plumbic,  argentic,  and  mercurous  salts, 
and  a  green  precipitate  with  cupric  salts,  of  the  respective  isocyanates. 

103.  Amnionic  Cyanate. — When  cyanic  acid  vapour,  and  ammonia 
gas,  both  perfectly  dry,  are  brought  together  in  a  dry  balloon,  they 
unite  directly  and  form  a  snow-white  woolly-crystalline  powder,  which, 
in  fresh  aqueous  solution,  with  potassic  hydrate,  again  gives  ammonia 
and  potassic  cyanate,  but  on  evaporation  is  converted  into  the  isomeric 
urea(§   130): 

(NH4).0-CEN         =         0=C<^22 

104.  Cyanuric  Acid,  or  Tricyanic  Acid,  H3C3N303,  probably 
(C3N3)(OH)3. — Under  certain  conditions  cyanic  acid  polymerises 
into  the  triple  molecule.  When  a  solution  of  potassic  cyanate  is 
mixed  with  dilute  acetic  acid,  hydric  potassic  cyanurate  crystallises 
slowly  out : 

3KCNO  +  2(HO.C2H30)  =  KH2C3N303  +  2(KO.C2H30), 

from  which  cyanuric  acid  can  be  prepared.  It  is  also  most  easily 
prepared  from  urea,  which  is  heated  until  the  mass  at  first  melted 
solidifies.  This  is  treated  with  cold  water  (Biuret,  §  136),  the  resi- 
due dissolved  in  potassic  hydrate,  and  the  cyanuric  acid  liberated  by 
means  of  hydrochloric  acid.  Urea,  obtained  as  shown  in  the  last 
paragraph,  from  a  molecule  of  ammonia  and  a  molecule  of  cyanic 
acid,  splits  up  so  that  three  molecules  of  it  give  up  three  molecules  of 
ammonia,  whilst  the  three  cyanic  acids  polymerise  to  cyanuric  acid  : 

3CON2H4  =  3NH3  +  C3N3H303. 

Cyanuric  acid  crystallises  in  slightly  acid,  colourless  crystals,  with 
two  molecules  of  water,  which  are  given  off  at  100°;  it  is  difficultly 
soluble  in  cold  water,  but  can  be  crystallised  from  boiling  water. 

With  metals  it,  like  orthophosphoric  acid,  forms  three  series  of 
salts  : 

Diacid  salts MHaCaNgOa

Normal  salts M3C3N3O3 

as  in  Triargentic  cyanurate    .     Ag3C3N303 

The  salts  of  cyanuric  acid  are  without  exception  crystallisable  \ 
those  of  the  alkali  metals  are  soluble  in  water,  those  of  the  heavy 
metals  difficultly  soluble  or  insoluble.  The  only  normal  salts  known 
are  those  of  lead  and  silver. 

By  heating  as  already  mentioned,  cyanuric  acid  is  converted  into 
cyanic  acid  : 

H3C3N303=  3HCNO.

With  phosphoric  chloride  it  gives,  on  warming,  solid  cyanogen 
chloride  : 

C3N3O3H3  -f  3PC15  =  3P0C13  +  3HC1  +  C3N3CI3.

SULPHOCYANOGEN    COMPOUNDS. 

105.  The  alkaline  salts  of  sulphocyanic  acid  are  obtained  from  the 
alkaline  cyanides  by  direct  addition  of  sulphur,  and  the  combination 
takes  place  not  only  by  melting  the  ingredients,  but  even  by  boiling 
them  together  with  water. 

Sulphocyanic  acid  is  obtained  by  addition  of  strong  mineral  acids 
to  its  salts ;  if  an  excess  of  the  acid  has  been  employed,  it  readily  splits 
up  into  hydrocyanic  acid  and  persulphodicyanic  acid. 

It  is  usually  prepared  by  decomposition  of  its  mercury  salt  by  dry 
hydrochloric  acid  or  hydric  sulphide  : 

Hg<|ZciN  +  H'8  =  H§S  +  2H-S-CEEN, 

as  a  colourless  liquid  of  pungent  acetous  odour,  which  solidifies  at 
— 12*5°  to  hexagonal  plates.  At  higher  temperatures  (towards  100°)  it 
boils,  the  greater  part  suffering  the  decomposition  above  mentioned. 
"When  damp,  it  decomposes  into  ammonic  carbonate,  carbonic  disul- 
phide,  and  hydric  sulphide  : 

2(CN)SH  +  3H20  =  (NH4)2C03  +  CS2 
or  (CN)SH  +  3H20  =  (NH4)HC03  +  SH2, 

and  yields  carbonic  oxysulphide  by  warming  with  very  dilute  sul- 
phuric acid  : 

C<^S_H    +   H*S04    +    H20  =  C<S    +  NH4-HS04- 

Its  aqueous  solution  has  a  strongly  acid  reaction,  and  can  only  be  kept, 
for  any  length  of  time,  at  low  temperatures.  It  colours  ferric  salts 
blood-red,  from  formation  of  ferric  sulpho-cyanate,  and,  on  account  of 
the  intensity  of  this  colour,  is  used,  in  the  form  of  any  of  its  soluble 
salts,  to  detect  small  traces  of  iron. 

106.  Potassic  sulphocyanate  is   generally  prepared  by  heating   a 


SULPHOCYANOGEN   COMPOUNDS.  7  9 

mixture  of  forty-six  parte  of  dry  potassic  ferrocyanide,  seventeen  parts 
potassic  carbonate,  and  thirty-two  parts  of  sulphur.     The  ignited  i 
is  boiled  with  alcohol,  and  on  cooling,  tin-  salt  separates  in  loog,  clear, 
striated  plates,  which   deliquesce   in  moist   air,  and  melt  on  gently 
heating. 

The  ready  formation  of  tin's  salt   is  used  as  a  means  of  detect] 
small  quantities  of  sulphur.     For  this  purpose,  the  Bubstance  <<»  be 
tested  for  sulphur,  or  a  sulphide,  is  heated  with  some  dry  pot 
cyanide,  the  mass,  when  cold,  extracted  with  water,  the  liquid  rendered 
slightly  acid  and  tested  with  ferric  chloride;  a  blood  -red  oolour  shows 
the  presence  of  sulphur. 

Sodio  vulphocyanaU  is  prepared  similarly  to  the  potassium  salt ; 
it  occurs  in  small  quantity  in  saliva,  and  can  be  detected  therein  by 
ferric  chloride. 

107.  Amnionic  sulphocyanate  is  prepared  on  the  large  scale  by 
boiling  amnionic  cyanide  solution  (wash-water  from  gas- works)  with 
sulphur,  also  by  heating  carbonic  disulphide  with  alcoholic  ammonia  : 

CS2  +  4NH3  =  NH4.SCN  +  (NH,)2S. 

It  is  also  easily  formed  by  mixing  prussic  acid  with  yellow  ammonic 
sulphide,  and  evaporating  off  the  excess  of  the  latter  on  the  water 
bath: 

2HCN  +  (NH4)2S3=  2  (NH4)SCN  +  H2S. 

This  last  reaction  affords  an  excellent  means  of  testing  for  small 
quantities  of  prussic  acid. 

Ammonic  sulphocyanate  forms  readily  soluble  crystals,  quite 
similar  to  those  of  the  potassic  salt,  which  molt  without  change  at 
147°,  and  at  170°  begin  to  suffer  an  analogous  decomposition  to  that 
which  occurs  to  ammonic  cyanate  at  ordinary  temperatures ;  namely,  it 
forms  sulphurea  :

108.  The  su lphocyanates  of  the  alkaline  earths,  and  of  the  metals 

of  the  sine  and  iron  group,  are  soluble  in  water,  partly  also  in  alcohol. 
Ferric  sulphocyanate  is  an  iincrystallisable,  nearly  Mack,  deliquescent 
mass,  which  dissolves  in  water  and  alcohol  with  deep  blood-red  oolour. 

The  sulphocyanate-  ofcopper,  lead,  silver,  ami  mereury  are  obtained  DJ

(CN)2S  =  S<^EEt>t>  is  obtained  in  clear  rhombic  tables,  by  acting  on 

argentic  sulphocyanate  with  an  ethereal  solution  of  cyanogen  iodide : 

Ag— S— C=N  +  I— C=Nr=AgI  +  S  (CN)2, 

and  evaporating  the  liquid.  It  smells  like  the  iodide,  sublimes  ev^en 
at  30°  in  thin  leaves,  and  fuses  at  65°.  It  is  soluble,  unchanged  in 
alcohol,  ether,  and  carbonic  disulphide.  The  aqueous  solution  decom- 
poses readily  with  separation  of  a  yellow  powder.  With  potassic 
hydrate  solution,  cyanogen  sulphide  yields  potassic  cyanate  and  sulpho- 
cyanate : 

(CN)2S  +  2KOH  =  KOCN  +  KSCN  +  H20. 

110.  Isosulphocyanic  acid  is  still  unknown,  but  the  potassic  salt, 
S=C:=:N — K,  is  obtained  by  warming  persulphocyanic  acid  (follow- 
ing paragraph)  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate,  in  the  form  of  granular 
crystals,  whose  aqueous  solution  is  not  reddened  by  ferric  salts,  and 
yields  coloured  precipitates  with  cobalt,  nickel,  and  cadmium  salts. 
If  the  solution  of  the  potassic  salt  is  boiled  for  a  long  time,  or  if  the 
dry  salt  be  heated  to  melting,  it  is  converted  into  the  ordinary  sulpho- 
cyanate. The  true  sulphocyanates  are  more  stable  at  high  tempera- 
tures than  the  isosulphocyanates,  whilst  with  the  oxycyanates  exactly 
the  reverse  is  the  case,  probably  in  consequence  of  the  greater  affinity 
of  oxygen  for  carbon. 

111.  Persulphodi cyanic  acid  (persulphocyanic  acid),  C2N2H2S3, 
separates  slowly  in  yellow  needles,  with  evolution  of  hydrocyanic  acid, 
when  a  saturated  solution  of  potassic  sulphocyanate  is  mixed  with  six 
times  its  bulk  of  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid  : 

3KSCN  +  3HC1  =  3KC1  +  HON  +  H2£T2C2S3. 

The  precipitate  is  purified  by  solution  in  dilute  ammonia,  and  the 
amnionic  salt  so  formed  decomposed  at  the  boiling  temperature  by 
hydrochloric  acid.  On  cooling  the  compound  crystallises  in  golden- 
yellow  needles,  difficultly  soluble  in  boiling  water.  With  the  alkalies 
persulphocyanic  acid  forms,  readily  soluble,  with  many  of  the  heavy- 
metals,  insoluble  compounds ;  if,  for  instance,  a  hot  solution  of  the 
acid  be  mixed  with  plumbic  acetate,  the  lead  salt  is  precipitated  in  the 
form  of  a  deep  yellow  amorphous  powder,  of  the  formula  PbC2N2S3. 

As  the  potassium  salt  of  persulphocyanic  acid,  when  warmed  with 
alcoholic  potassic  hydrate,  yields  potassic  isosulphocyanate  (see  §  110), 
it  follows  most  probably  that  persulphocyanic  acid  must  also  be 
expressed  as  an  iso  compound  [(CS)NH].,S,  whose  structure  would 
be

When  heated  in  a  stream  of  chlorine,  it  yields,  besides  mellone  and 
sulphur  chloride,  tricyanogen  chloride;  by  heating  with  concentrated 
hydrochloric  acid,  it  gives  hydrio  sulphide,  hydric  persulphide,  and

It  crystallises  in  colourless  leaves,  which   melt  unchanged  at  205°,

With  argentic  nitrate,  dicyanodiamide  yields  a  compound 

C2N4H4AgN03  =  (C2N2)<NH,Ag  on()2> 

which  on  addition  of  ammonia  is  converted  into  argentic  dicyano-

If  a  solution  of  dicyanodiamide  be  evaporated  with  hydrochloric  acid, 
there  remain  large  tables  of  dicyanodiamidine  hydrochlorate  : 

(C2N2)  (NH2)2  +  H20  +  HC1  =  G2H6N40.HC1, 

from  which  dicyanodiamidine  can  be  separated.  This  latter  is  readily 
soluble  in  water,  difficultly  in  alcohol,  has  strongly  basic  properties, 
and  yields  well-crystallised  salts.  It  results  from  dicyanodiamide  by 
the  addition  of  the  elements  of  water,  probably  according  to  the 
equation  :

the  temperature  raised  sufficiently  to  fuse  the  resulting  antimonious

potassic  sulphide  removed  by  plumbic  hydrate,  and  the  liquid  boiled 
and  filtered ;  on  cooling  tripotassic  mellonide  crystallises  in  fine  silky 
needles,  which  dissolve  pretty  easily  in  warm  water,  but  not  at  all  in 
alcohol  or  ether. 

When  the  concentrated  solution  of  this  salt  is  mixed  with  acetic 
acid,  dipotassic  hydric  mellonide  crystallises  out  in  glittering  clino- 
rhombic  needles  : 

C9N13K3  +  HO.C2H30  =  C9N13HK2  +  KO.C2H30, 
whilst  hydrochloric  acid  gives,  with  the  original  solution,  a  white 
precipitate  of  dihydric  potassic  mellonide,  C9N13H2K.

Cyanogen  and  Paracyamm 

124.  From  its  compounds  with  those  metals  whoso  oxides  decom- 
pose on  ignition  with  evolution  of  oxygen,  cyanogen  is  split  off  on 
heating  and  is  obtained  as  cyanogen  gas  and  paracyanogen.  Both 
bodies  contain  nitrogen  and  carbon  only,  and  that  in  the  same  ratio  ; 
they  consist  not  of  single  cyanogen  groups,  but  of  several  such  united 
with  one  another. 

C=N 
Cyanogen,  or  dicycmogi  n,  < \,N.,  =  |  ,  is  most  readily  obtained 

C=N 

by  heating  mercuric  cyanide  in  a  retort  of  difficultly  fusible  glass  : 

Hg<jc£}  =  Hg  +  (CN)2> 

when  it  is  evolved,  together  with  easily  condensible  mercury  vapour. 
A  spongy  black  mass  of  paracyanogen  is  left  in  the  decomposition 
apparatus. 

Cyanogen  is  a  colourless  gas,  has  the  density  1*864,  and  condenses 
at  0°  under  a  pressure  of  1^  atmosphere  to  a  clear  liquid  of  specific 
gravity  -866,  which  boils  at  —  21°,  and  solidifies  to  a  striated  ice-like 
mass  below  —  34°.  The  odour  of  the  gas  is  peculiar,  and  similar  to 
that  of  prussic  acid.  Lighted  in  air,  it  burns  with  a  blue,  peach-edged 
flame  to  carbonic  anhydride  and  nitrogen  : 

C2N2  +  202  =  2C02  +  N2. 

Water  absorbs  four  to  five  times  its  volume,  alcohol  twenty-two 
times  its  volume  of  the  gas.  These  solutions  become  dark-coloured 
on  long  standing,  dark-brown  flocks  separating,  which  are  soluble  in 
alkalies  and  reprecipitated  by  acids.  In  the  formation  of  this  decom- 
position product,  the  elements  of  water  take  part,  as  oxygen  and  hy- 
drogen are  contained  in  it  as  well  as  carbon  and  nitrogen.  The  name 
azulmir  add  has  been  given  to  it.  There  is  formed  at  tin-  Bame  time 
in  the  solution  ammonic  oxalate,  carbonate  and  formate,  and  urea. 
The  formation  of  the  ammonic  formate  is  due  to  a  decomposition  into 
cyanic  and  prussic  acids: 

CN         H 

|      +      |      =  CNH  +  CNOH,

The  ammonia  formed  then  combines  w  ith  a  part  of  the  cyanic  acid 

to  form  area  ( j  130),  tat  otherwise  also  with  water  to  convert  still 

unaltered  dievanogen  into  a/.wlmie  acid. 


88  CYANOGEN   COMPOUNDS. 

Azulmic  acid  is  formed  in  large  quantities  together  with  amnionic 
oxalate  by  action  of  cyanogen  on  aqueous  ammonia. 

On  the  other  hand,  by  bringing  together  equal  volumes  of  dry 
ammonia  and  cyanogen  gases,  they  combine  to  form  a  black  amor- 
phous powder  of  the  formula  C4N6H6,  hydrazulmine  : 

2(C2N2)  +  2NH3  =  C4lSr6H6, 
which  is  rapidly  converted  into  azulmic  acid  by  action  of  water  : 

C4N6H6  +  H20  =  C4N5H50  +  NH3, 
the  direct  formation  of  the  latter  being  represented  by 
2C2N2  +  H20  +  NH3  =  C4N5H50. 
If  an  aqueous  solution  of  cyanogen  be  mixed   with  some  acetic 
aldehyde,  it  is  completely  converted  into  oxamide  :

whilst  in   presence  of   strong    mineral  acids    it    is    converted  into 
oxalic  acid :

C=N  CO.OH 

Tliis  transformation  shows  most  strikingly  that  the  carbon  atoms 
in  dicyanogen  are  joined  together,  and  also  that  oxalic  acid  is  a  true 
dicarbonide. 

There  are  indeed  also  other  reactions  known,  by  which  the  carbon 
atoms  of  dicyanogen  are  disunited,  with  formation  of  single  cyanogen 
compounds ;  for  instance,  on  passing  dicyanogen  through  potassic 
hydrate,  there  is  formed,  besides  potassic  azulmate,  considerable 
quantities  of  potassic  cyanide  and  cyanate  : 

C2N2  +  2KOH  =  KCN  4-  KCNO  +  OH2 ; 

on  passing  it  over  ignited  potassic  carbonate,  potassic  cyanate  and 
isocyanate  are  formed  :

whilst  potassium  heated  in  cyanogen  burns  and  forms  potassic  cyanide  :

125.  By  the  trivalent  combination  of  the  nitrogen  to  the  carbon 
atoms,  cyanogen  appears  as  a  double  ammonia  molecule,  whose  six 
hydrogen  atoms  are  replaced  by  the  hexavalent  dicarbon  group,  C2. 
In  consequence  of  this  method  of  saturation  of  the  nitrogen  atoms, 
the  cyanogen  molecule  is  able  (like  hydrocyanic  acid)  to  form  com- 
pounds, which  are  analogous  in  many  ways  to  ammonia  derivatives. 


CYANOGEN.  89 

Especially  noticeable  amongst  these  are  the  compounds  with  hydric 
sulphide. 

When  equal  volumes  of  cyanogen  and  hydric  sulphide  are  mixed 
together  in  glass  vessels,  the  sides  of  the  latter  are  soon  covered  with 
yellow  crystals  of  cyanogen  monosulphhydrate,  C2N2H2S  :

On  passing  cyanogen  into  a  saturated  solution  of  sulphuretted

90  CYANOGEN   COMPOUNDS. 

126.  Paracyanogen,  C#N#,  is,  as  already  mentioned,  a  porous 
blackish  substance  left  behind  in  the  preparation  of  cyanogen  gas  from 
mercuric  cyanide.  It  contains  carbon  and  nitrogen  only,  and  is  poly- 
meric to  cyanogen.  By  strong  ignition  it  is  converted  into  cyano- 
gen ;  by  action  of  potassic  hydrate  it  yields  true  potassic  cyanate. 

Guanidine,  CN3H5. 

127.  Guanidine  is  a  body  genetically  related  to  the  cyanogen 
amides,  as  it  contains  a  carbon  atom  whose  four  bonds  are  saturated 
by  nitrogen,  being  united  to  three  atoms  of  the  latter. 

Guanidine  is  carbondiamide-imide : 

/NH2 

\nh2 

It  was  originally  prepared  by  the  decomposition  of  guanine  (see 
this)  by  chlorine,  but  later  also  obtained  in  many  other  ways.  It  is 
obtained  from  chloropicrin  and  orthocarbonic  ether  by  action  of 
ammonia,  and  by  heating  urea  or  biuret  (§  137)  in  an  atmosphere  of 
hydrochloric  acid. 

It  is  further  obtained  by  action  of  an  alcoholic  cyanamide  solu- 
tion upon  amnionic  chloride  at  a  temperature  of  100°.  According  to 
the  equation  : 

N  ^NH 

C<W    +  NH4C1  =  Cf-NH2 

Ni±*  \NH3C1 

the  hydrochloride  is  first  formed,  soluble  in  water  and  alcohol,  from 
which  guanidine  is  separated  by  argentic  oxide. 

It  is  also  easily  obtained  as  the  hydrodide  by  heating  cyanogen 
iodide  with  alcoholic  ammonia  to  100°  : 

C^N  /NH2

It  forms  colourless  crystals,  readily  soluble  in  water  and  alcohol, 
of  strong  alkaline  taste.  It  abs6rbs  carbonic  anhydride  from  the  air, 
and  forms  therewith  a  salt  crystallising  in  beautiful  quadratic  prisms, 
(CN3H5)2H2C03.  Guanidine  nitrate,  CN3H5.HNT03,  crystallises  in 
colourless  prisms,  rather  difficultly  soluble  in  water.  The  hydro- 
chloride yields  with  platinic  chloride  yellowish-red  prisms,  of  the 
formula  2CN3H6Cl,PtCl4,  easily  soluble  in  water,  and  hydrated 
alcohol,  difiicultly  soluble  in  anhydrous  alcohol;  with  auric  chloride 
beautiful  long,  deep-yellow  needles,  CN3H6C1,  AuCl3,  rather  difiicultly 
soluble  in  water. 

By  heating  with  concentrated  alkaline  solutions,  it  is  resolved 
into  ammonia  and  carbonic  acid  :

The  latter  compound,  formerly  only  known  in  the  gaseous  state,  has 
lately  been  obtained,  by  sufficient  reduction  of  temperature,  as  a 
colourless  liquid  of  specific  gravity  1*432,  and  boiling  at  +  8°.  The 
liquid  is  most  readily  obtained  when  chloroform  (two  parts)  is  heated 
with  a  mixture  of  potassic  dichromate  (five  parts)  and  sulphuric  acid 
(forty  parts),  and  the  evolved  gases  conducted  through  strongly 
cooled  tubes. 

The  properties  and  modes  of  preparation  of  the  oxides  and  sul-

occurs  in  the  urine  of  all  animals,  more  especially  of  the  mammalia, 
and  amongst  these  in  largest  quantity  in  that  of  carnivorse ;  also 
in  other  animal  fluids,  as  in  blood,  the  amniotic  liquid,  and  the 
vitreous  humour  of  the  eyes  of  mammalia,  &c,  but  normally  in  only 
small  quantity.  In  animal  bodies,  it  results  from  the  retrograde 
metamorphosis  of  nitrogenous  tissue,  and  also  from  the  direct  decom- 
position of  nitrogenous  food  without  previous  conversion  into  animal 
tissue.  It  is  separated  from  the  blood  by  the  kidneys,  and  leaves  the 
body  in  the  urine.  On  interruption  of  the  secretion  by  the  kidneys, 
its  quantity  increases  in  the  blood  and  other  animal  fluids. 

It  is  prepared  synthetically  (together  with  other  bodies)  by  action 
of  ammonia  upon  carbonic  oxychloride  :

mide  on  treatment  with  dilute  nitric  acid  (§  114),  most  easily  by  the 
transformation  of  ammonic  cyanate  (§  103). 

This  last  method  of  preparation  was  discovered  by  WShler  in 
1828,  and  is  historically  important,  as  the  first  instance  of  an  un- 
doubtedly organic  body  being  obtained  by  artificial  means. 

Instead  of  preparing  ammonic  cyanate  from  cyanic  acid  and 
ammonia  gas,  and  then  transforming  it  into  urea  by  repeated  solution 
in  water  and  evaporation,  the  aqueous  solution  of  crude  potassic 
pseudocyanate  is  decomposed  by  an  equivalent  quantity  of  ammonic 
sulphate  : 

2CKn-K  +  (NH4)2SO<  =  2C4-NH,+  K*S04. 
whereby,  instead  of  ammonic  pseudocyanate,  urea  is  obtained  : 

G<N-NH  =         C^NH2 


UREA.  93 

The  liquid  is  then  concentrated  on  the  water  bath,  by  which  means  the 
greater  part  of  the  potassic  sulphate  separates,  and  can  be  filtered  off ; 
the  mother  liquor  is  then  evaporated  to  dryness,  and  the  urea  extracted 
from  the  residue  by  absolute  alcohol,  potassic  sulphate  being  com- 
pletely insoluble. 

Urea  can  be  obtained  with  equal  ease  from  human  urine.  The 
urine  is  evaporated  on  the  water  bath  to  a  syrupy  consistence,  then 
cooled  with  slow  addition  of  excess  of  nitric  acid,  whereupon  the 
whole  solidifies  to  a  pasty  mass  of  urea  nitrate;  this  is  freed  from  the 
mother  liquor  by  draining  and  pressure  between  porous  plates,  and  re- 
crystallised  from  lukewarm  water.  It  is  then  usually  treated  with 
animal  charcoal,  to  remove  colouring  matters  as  far  as  possible.  The 
purified  nitrate  is  then  dissolved  in  warm  water,  decomposed  with 
baric  carbonate  : 

2CO(NH2)2.HN03  +  BaC03  =  Ba(N03)o  +  C02 
+  H20  4-  2CO(NH2)2, 

the  whole  evaporated  to  dryness  on  the  water  bath,  and  the  free  urea 
dissolved  by  strong  boiling  alcohol,  in  which  baric  nitrate  is  in- 
soluble. 

131.  Urea  crystallises  in  long  colourless  prisms,  of  neutral  re- 
action, destitute  of  odour,  and  of  cooling  nitre-like  taste.  It  melts  at 
130°  and  decomposes  at  a  slightly  higher  temperature,  with  evolution 
of  ammonia. 

It  is  extremely  soluble  in  water,  and  in  boiling  absolute  alcohol. 
It  requires  for  solution  five  times  its  weight  of  cold  alcohol,  and  is 
nearly  completely  insoluble  in  ether. 

132.  Comjyounds  of  Urea  with  Acids. — Urea  behaves  towards  acids 
like  a  weak  basic  amide,  i.e.  it  forms  salts  with  them,  similar  to  those 
of  ammonia ;  although  derived  from  two  molecules  of  the  latter,  it 
however  only  combines  with  one  molecule  of  a  monobasic  acid.  The 
amide  derivatives  of  organic  acids,  to  be  described  further  on,  in  which 
the  carboxyl  group  is  united  with  a  single  amide  group,  show  little  or 
no  disposition  to  unite  with  acids,  so  that  the  electro-negative  radical 
CO  greatly  hinders  or  entirely  removes  the  disposition  of  the  nitrogen 
to  combine  with  akcids. 

A  similar  influence  is  exerted  by  carboxyl  on  the  two  amide 
groups  combined  with  it  in  urea,  so  much  so  that  the  union  of  one 
amide  group  with  an  acid  is  sufficient  to  destroy  the  basic  character 
of  the  whole  molecule. 

All  salts  of  urea  show  an  acid  reaction,  and  a  strong  tendency  to 
decompose  in  aqueous  solution  ;  there  results  from  their  decomposition 
amnionic  salts,  carbonic  anhydride,  and  urea  :

In  preparing  area  salts,  therefore,   the  preeenoe  of  water  must 

either  he  entirely  avoided,  Or  at  least  any  warming  therewith,  as  this 
materially  assists  the  decomposition.  (  tf  these  .salts  the  following  are

133.  Compounds  of  Urea  with  Metallic  Oxides. — Urea  forms  crys- 
talline compounds  with  the  oxides  of  mercury  and  silver.  Both 
metals  very  easily  replace  a  portion  of  the  hydrogen  in  ammonia  by 
action  of  their  oxides  upon  it,  and  their  behaviour  with  organic 
amide  compounds  is  similar ;  it  is  therefore  most  probable  that  in  the 
above-mentioned  compounds  the  metal  is  in  direct  union  with 
nitrogen. 

Urea  mercuric  oxide  is  formed  directly  by  digesting  a  solution  of 
urea  with  mercuric  oxide,  as  a  white  crystalline  powder  of  the  formula 
CON2H4,HgO.  Another  compound,  2CON2H4,3HgO,  results,  by 
mixing  an  alkaline  solution  of  urea  with  mercuric  chloride,  as  a 
gelatinous  precipitate,  which  becomes  granular  in  hot  water,  whilst 
mercuric  nitrate,  similarly  heated,  gives  a  body  of  the  formula 
CON2H4,2HgO.  The  constitution  of  these  compounds  may  be 
expressed  by  the  structural  formulae

134.  Compounds  of  Urea  with  Salts. — The  methods  of  combination 
occurring  in  the  compounds  formed  by  union  of  urea  with  aciils  and 
with  oxides  respectively,  both  occur  in  its  union  with  many  salts. 
These  bodies  are  obtained  by  evaporating  the  mixed  solutions  of  their 
components.

compound  in  a  solution  of  a  large  quantity  of  common  salt,  causes 
this  latter  to  separate  in  octahedra  on  evaporation.

contain  urea,  nitric  acid,  and  the  elements  of  mercuric  oxide,  the 
latter  being  in  excess.  With  very  dilute  solutions,  the  compound

135.  Estimation  of  Ursa  by  Titration. — Liebig  devised  a  method 

for  the  estimatiom  of  urea,  baaed  on  the  formation  of  the  above-men- 
tioned compoimd,  which,  whilst  sufficiently  accurate  for  most  pur 
poses,  lias  the  advantages  of  quickness  ami  simplicity. 

A  solution  of  mercuric  nitrate   is  prepared  which  contains  71*48 


96  AMIDE  DERIVATIVES   OF   CARBONIC  ACID. 

grams  of  mercury  per  litre.  One  c.c.  of  this  solution  is  sufficient  to 
precipitate  -01  gram  of  urea  from  a  two  per  cent,  solution.  In  the 
reaction  that  ensues  on  adding  the  standard  mercury  solution  to  the 
urea,  nitric  acid  is  set  free,  and  as  the  precipitate  is  soluble  to  a 
considerable  extent  in  this,  the  end  of  the  reaction  cannot  be  arrived 
at  by  adding  the  mercury  solution  until  no  more  precipitate  is  formed. 
By  taking  small  portions  of  the  liquid  out  from  time  to  time  during 
the  titration,  and  testing  them  with  sodic  hydrate,  the  end  point  is 
easily  seen,  as  a  yellow  precipitate  of  mercuric  oxide  results  as  soon 
as  the  mercury  solution  is  in  the  least  excess,  instead  of  the  white 
precipitate  previously  obtained.  The  number  of  c.c.  of  mercuric 
nitrate  solution  required  to  arrive  at  this  point,  multiplied  by  -01,  gives 
the  weight  of  urea  present. 

In  the  estimation  of  urea  in  urine,  the  phosphoric  acid  present 
must  be  previously  removed ;  this  is  best  done  by  adding  excess  of  a 
mixture  of  baric  hydrate  and  nitrate  (both  this  and  the  urea  solutions 
being  measured) ;  the  resulting  precipitate  is  then  removed  by  means 
of  an  unmoistened  filter  and  the  filtrate  then  titrated. 

As  urine  always  contains  sodic  chloride,  and  this  latter  converts 
the  mercury  solution  into  mercuric  chloride,  which  gives  no  precipitate 
with  urea  in  non -alkaline  solutions,  the  free  baric  hydrate  is  neutra- 
lised, and  mercury  solution  run  in  until  a  cloudiness  is  produced, 
which  remains  after  vigorous  shaking ;  this  indicates  that  all  the 
sodic  chloride  has  been  decomposed,  and  the  burettes  can  now  be  read 
off,  and  the  titration  proceeded  with  as  above. 

136.  Decompositions  of  Urea. — Of  the  numerous  decompositions  of 
urea,  the  following  are  the  most  important. 

Urea  unites  with  the  elements  of  two  molecules  of  water  to  form 
amnionic  carbonate  : 

/NHo  H20  /ONH4 

C4=0         +  =     C^O 

\NHS  H20  \ONH4 

At  ordinary  temperatures  this  decomposition  only  takes  place  with  the 
aid  of  ferments,  as,  for  instance,  in  the  alkaline  putrefaction  of  urine  ; 
by  boiling  in  aqueous  solution  it  occurs  only  slowlv,  more  quickly  by 
heating  in  sealed  tubes  to  230°-240°. 

Urea  suffers  analogous  decompositions  when  heated  with  strong 
acids  and  alkalies ;  in  the  first  case,  carbonic  anhydride  and  the 
amnionic  salts  of  the  respective  acids  are  formed  : 

CO(NH2)  +  H20  +  2H2S04  =  2(NH4)HS04  +  C02 ; 

in  the  second  case,  carbonate  of  the  alkali  and  free  ammonia  : 

CO(NH2)2  +  2KOH  =  CO(OK)2  +  2NH3. 

Methods  for  the  estimation  of  urea  are  similarly  founded  on  those 
reactions ;  either  it  is  decomposed  by  concentrated  sulphuric  acid,  and 
the  amount  of  ammonia  combined  with  the  latter  determined,  or  it  is 
heated  with  baric  hydrate  to  a  high  temperature,  and  the  baric  car- 
bonate weighed  : 

CO(NH2)2  +  Ba(OH)2  =  BaC03  ■)-  2NH3. 


BIURET.  97 

By  heating  with  argentic  nitrate,  argentic  psendocyanate  and  amnionic 
nitrate  are  formed  : 

CO(NH2)2  +  AgN03  =  CO.NAg  +  NH4.N03. 

Urea  is  also  converted  into  cyanogen  derivatives  when  heated  by 
itself;  at  150°-160°  ammonia  is  evolved,  at  first  with  incipient 
fusion  of  the  mass,  which  then  solidifies  and  consists  of  cyanuric  acid 
(§  104),  ammelide,  or  cyamcluric  acid  and  biuret  (§  137).  This  de- 
composition is  represented  by  the  equations  : 

3CON2H,  =  3NH3  +  (C3N3)  (OH)3  (cyanuric  acid). 

3CON2H4  =  2NH3  +  H20  +  (C3N3)  {  ^*)»  (ammelide). 

2CON2H4  =  NH3  +  C202N3H5  (biuret). 

The  first  of  these  is  the  reversal  of  the  formation  of  urea  from  amnio- 
nic cyanate. 

Cyanuric  acid  alone  is  obtained  by  heating  urea  hydrochloride  to 
a  high  temperature  : 

3C0(NH2).(NH3C1)  =  3NH4C1  +  (C3N3)  (OH)3. 

Chlorine  gas  acts  similarly  when  passed  over  fused  urea,  but  nitrogen 
and  hydrochloric  acid  are  also  formed  : 

6CON2H4  +  3C12  =  2C3N303H3  +  4NH4C1  +  2HC1  +  N2. 

By  the  dry  distillation  of  urea  with  phosphoric  anhydride,  cyanic  acid 
distils  over,  whilst  amnionic  metaphosphate  and  ammelide  remain 
behind. 

Dicyandiamidine  (§  116)  is  probably  urea-guanidine. 

Biuret. 

137.  Dicarboxylrdiamid-imide,  C202N3H5,  has  already  been  men- 
tioned above  as  one  of  the  decomposition-products  of  urea,  when 
heated  to  150°-1G0°.  It  is  obtained  from  two  molecules  of  the  latter, 
one  losing  an  amide  group,  and  the  other  a  hydrogen  atom,  the  bonds 
thereby  set  free  uniting  :

On  mixing  a  solution  of  biuret  with  argentic  nitrate,  and  then 
carefully  adding  alkali,  a  colourless  but  easily  blackened  precipitate 
of  diargento-biuret,  C202N3H3Ag2,  is  obtained. 

Anhydrous  biuret  melts  at  190°,  and  at  a  slightly  higher  tempera- 
ture decomposes  into  cyanuric  acid  and  ammonia  : 

3C202N3H5  =  3NH3  +  2C3N3H3O3. 

Heated  to  100°  in  an  atmosphere  of  hydrochloric  acid,  it  yields  a 
saline  compound  of  the  formula  2C202N"3H5,HC1  j  at  higher  tem- 
peratures it  gives  guanidine  hydrochloride,  and  carbonic  anhydride  : 

C202N3H5  +  HC1  =  C02  +  CN3H5.HC1, 

together  with  sal  ammoniac  and  a  difficultly  soluble  compound,  which 
has  been  termed  urea-cyanurate  : 

2C202N3H5  +  HC1  =  NH4C1  +  C4H7N604. 

This  latter  is  probably  a  body  of  analogous  composition  to  biuret,  and 
may  be  viewed  as  tetruret : 

NH2.CO.NH.CO.NH2  (biuret). 

NH2.CO.NH.CO.NH.CO.NH.CO.NH2     (tetruret). 

The  relations  of  biuret  to  the  so-called  allophanic  ethers  will  be 
spoken  of  later. 

138.  Corresponding  to  carboxyl  is  the  radical  CS,  thiocarbonyl, 
which  has,  however,  as  yet  never  been  obtained  uncombined  like  car- 
bonic oxide ;  it  has  only  to  be  mentioned  here  in  connection  with  its 
amide  derivatives,  which  in  their  behaviour  closely  resemble  the 
carboxylamide  compounds. 

/NH2 

139.  Sutyho-carbamic  acid,  CH3NS2  =  C==S       ,  amnionic   sul-

pho-carbamate,  is  formed  (like  the  corresponding  oxy-derivative)  by 
action  of  ammonia  on  carbonic  disulphide,  best  when  alcoholic  solutions 
of  both  are  employed  : 

G4%       +     2NH3     =    cfNH2 
&  N3.NH4 

From  this  salt,  which  crystallises  in  yellow  prisms,  sulpho-carbamic 
acid  is  obtained,  by  action  of  hydrochloric  acid,  as  a  reddish-coloured 
oily  liquid,  which  solidifies  at  ordinary  temperatures  to  a  crystalline 
mass,  and  after  a  time  decomposes  spontaneously  into  sulpho-cyanic 
acid  and  hydric  sulphide  : 

C^NH2    =  H2S  +     °sf N 

By  heating  with  excess  of  ammonia,   ammonic  sulpho-carbamate  is 
converted  into  ammonic  sulpho-cyanate  :

C^NH2        +  2NH3  =    <<=**  +  (NH4),S. 


SULPHUREA.  99 

140.  Sulphurea,  or  sulpho-carbonyl  diamide,  CSK9H4.     Whilst 

amnionic  cyanate  changes  at  ordinary  temperatures  into  urea,  amnio- 
nic sulpho-cyanate  only  undergoes  the  same  change  at  higher  tem- 
peratures : 

CHEN  =      C/NH2 

^S.NH4  \NH2 

In  order  to  prepare  sulphurea,  dry  ammonic  sulpho-cyanate  is  heated 
slowly  to  170°,  and  kept  at  that  temperature  for  several  hours ;  it  is 
then  cooled  to  100°,  and  dissolved  in  an  equal  weight  of  water  at  80°, 
filtered  and  cooled  to  crystallisation.  The  crystals  arc  freed  from  the 
mother  liquor,  which  contains  unaltered  ammonic  sulpho-cyanate,  and 
purified  by  repeated  recrystallisation  from  very  little  hot  water.  Sul- 
phurea crystallises  in  prisms,  dissolves  readily  in  water  and  alcohol, 
but  little  in  ether,  and  fuses  at  149°. 

Like  urea,  it  yields  with  nitric  acid  a  difficultly  soluble  nitrate  : 

CfNH2 
XNH3.O.N02 

Argentic  and  mercuric  derivatives  are  also  known,  which  decom- 
readily  with  formation  of  metallic  sulphides.  Similarly  also  on 
boiling  its  aqueous  solution  with  argentic  or  mercuric  oxides,  the  re- 
spective metallic  sulphides  are  precipitated,  whilst  dicyandiamide 
remains  in  solution.  By  heating  with  water  it  is  reconverted  into 
ammonic  sulpho-cyanate. 

Hydro-halogen  derivatives  of  sulphurea  are  formed  easily,  together 
with  carbonic  disulphide,  by  simultaneous  action  of  nascent  hydrogen 
and  hydro-haloids  upon  persulpho-dicyanic  acid  :

ETHANES   OR  PARAFFINS. 

Hydrocarbons  of  the  Series  CnH2n+2. 

141.  The  homologous  series  of  paraffins  embraces  those  hydro- 
carbons in  which  the  maximum  possible  number  of  hydrogen  atoms 
is  attached  to  the  carbon  nucleus  (§  40.)  Its  first  member  is  marsh 
gas  or  methane,  CH4,  from  which  the  higher  members  of  the  series 
can  be  obtained  by  substitution  of  its  hydrogen  by  the  hydrocarbon 
radicals  of  the  series  CnH2n+1  : 

CH4 —  H  +  CnH2n+i  =  CH3 .  CnH2n+1  =  C(n+1)  H2(n  +1)+2 
CH4 — 2  H  +  2  CnH2n+1  =  CH2 .  (CnH2n+1)2  =  C{2n+1)  H2(2n+1)+2 
CH4 — 3  H  +  3  CnH2n+1  =  CH  (CnH2n+1)3  =  C(3n+1)  H2(3n+1)+2 
CH4 — 4  H  +  4  CnH2n+1  =  C        (CnH2n+1)4  =  C(4n+D  H2(4n+1)+2 

The  series  is  therefore  also  known  as  the  marsh  gas  series. 

The  first  three  members  (CH4,  C2H6,  and  C3H8)  each  exist  in 
only  a  single  modification;  those  richer  in  carbon  show  isomers,  the 
possible  number  of  which  increases  with  the  carbon  contents  of  each 
member,  and  is  equal  to  the  number  of  possibilities  of  structure  in 
the  nucleus,  only  nucleus-isomerism  (§  46)  being  possible. 

The  hydrogen  atoms  of  the  paraffins  can  be  replaced  in  different 
amounts,  partly  directly,  as  by  the  halogens,  partly  indirectly  by  other 
elements  or  radicals.  There  thereby  results  an  enormous  number  of 
organic  bodies  which  are  known  as  the  marsh  gas  derivatives,  and 
which  in  their  totality  are  known  as  fatty  compounds. 

The  unattacked  remaining  hydrocarbon  residues  of  increasing 
valency  :

142.  By  substitution  of  only  a  single  hydrogen  atom  in  a  paraffin, 
a  residue  of  the  formula  CnH2n+l  remains,  which  exists  in  com- 
bination with  the  substituting  element  or  compound  radical.  Is  this

termed  a  monacid  alcohol.  The  residue  itself  is  termed  an  alcohol

145.  The  more  hydrogen  atoms  there  are  replaced  in  a  paraffin 
the  more  numerous  must  be  the  resulting  products.  But  as,  with 
exception  of  marsh  gas,  the  series  never  contains  carbon  atoms  united 
with  more  than  three  hydrogen  atoms,  there  results,  from  a  greater 
substitution  than  three,  only  combinations  of  the  simpler  categories, 
and  there  are  obtained  every  time  : 

1.  By  replacement  of  only  one  hydrogen  atom  at  a  carbon  atom, 
by  OH,  an  alcohol,  or  alcohol  derivative,  if  other  elements  or  com- 
pound radicals  are  the  replacing  bodies.  The  number  of  these  varieties 
of  substitution  that  can  take  place  in  a  paraffin  expresses  the  valency 
of  the  alcohol  radical,  or  the  '  acidity  '  of  the  alcohol.  It  results  from 
this  that  an  x  acid  alcohol  must  contain  at  least  x  carbon  atoms  in  its 
nucleus. 

2.  By  simultaneous  replacement  of  two  hydrogen  atoms  united  to 
one  and  the  same  carbon  atom,  there  are  obtained  : 

a.  If  the  replacement  be  at  a  terminal  carbon  atom  :  aldehydes 

or  aldehyde  derivatives. 

b.  If    at    an    intermediate    carbon    atom :    ketones    or   ketone

3.  Organic  acids  (in  the  true  sense)  or  their  derivatives  are  formed 
when  the  three  hydrogen  atoms  attached  to  a  terminal  carbon  atom 
are  simultaneously  replaced.

less  known  categories  of  transformation  and  substitution-derivatives 
of  the  paraffins  will  be  mentioned  at  their  respective  places. 

146.  The  series  of  paraffins  contains  members  with  nuclei  of  from 
one  to  at  least  thirty  atoms  of  carbon,  and  their  isomers.  Those 
poorest  in  carbon  are  gases ;  by  increasing  carbon  contents  liquids  and 
solids  follow,  whose  boiling  and  melting  points  increase,  as  a  rule,  with 
the  increase  in  molecular  weight.  They  are  nearly  or  quite  insoluble 
in  water,  burn  easily  when  heated  in  an  oxygen-containing  atmo- 
sphere, and  are  converted  into  substitution-derivatives  by  the  action 
of  the  halogens — especially  chlorine — when  exposed  to  light  or  heat : 

CnH2n+2  +  2C12  =  2HC1  +  CnH2nCl2 

C„H2n+2  +  3C12  =  3HC1  +  CnH^Cla  &c. 

Many  paraffins  are  also  attacked  by  strong  nitric  acid,  water  being 
eliminated,  and  a  product  formed  which  contains  the  nitric  acid 
radical  N02  (nitryl)  in  place  of  hydrogen.  Such  bodies  are  termed 
nitro-paraffins.     The  paraffins  are  very  indifferent  to  most  reagents. 

Occurrence  and  Formation  of  the  Paraffins. 

147.  Many  hydrocarbons  of  the  marsh-gas  series  occur  ready- 
formed  in  nature ;  they  are  formed  mostly  by  the  decomposition  of 
dead  putrefying  or  decaying  organisms,  and  are  therefore  very  fre- 
quently found  with  coal.  The  liquid  and  solid  paraffins  form  the  chief 
proportion  of  mineral  oil  or  petroleum,  from  which  a  large  number 
of  members  of  the  series  have  been  isolated  by  fractional  distillation. 

Paraffins  are  also  formed  in  the  dry  distillation  of  many  organic 
bodies,  though,  with  the  exception  of  the  gaseous  members,  only  in  small 
quantity  and  varying  proportion.  The  latter  depends  on  the  tempera- 
ture employed  and  the  duration  of  the  heating,  and  cannot  at  pn 
be  deduced  into  a  rule  approaching  certainty.  On  the  other  hand,  a 
series  of  reactions  are  known  which  serve  for  the  preparation  of  in- 
dividual members  of  the  series. 

148.  Synthetical  N>tli<»Is  <>/'  Preparing  Paraffin*. — No  paraffin  has 
been  prepared  as  yet  by  the  direct  action  of  carbon  upon  hydrogen  ; 
marsh  gas,  however,  has  been  obtained  by  means  oi  imple 
mineral  compounds  (see  later).  The  above-mentioned  methods  of 
synthesis  of  paraffins  are  from  already  existis  and 
fall  into  two  groups,  accordingly  as  the  transforms

104  PARAFFINS,  CnH2n+2. 

For  such  methods  the  zinc  compounds  of  the  monovalent  alcohol 
radicals  are  most  particularly  available.  They  react  with  water,  ac- 
cording to  the  equation 

Zn<£An+i  +2H20=Zn  <^  +  2CnK2n+2t 

with  such  violence  that  explosions  will  ensue  unless  the  ingredients 
are  mixed  with  great  care — best  previously  diluted  with  indifferent 
liquids. 

Other  organo-metallic  bodies,  such  as  those  of  mercury,  may  be 
employed,  but  halogen  acids  must  then  be  used  in  place  of  water,  this 
latter  not  altering  them  : 

Hg<p°52°+1  +  HCl=Hg<gvH*°+>  +  C„H2»+2. 

The  halogen  atoms  in  the  haloid  salts  of  the  mono-  and  polyvalent 
alcohol  radicals  can  be  substituted  by  hydrogen  in  various  ways,  as 
by  action  of  zinc  and  hydrochloric  acid  in  alcoholic  solution  : 

CnH2n+1Cl  +  Zn  +  HCl=CnH2n+2  +  ZnCl2. 

The  iodides  of  the  alcohol  radicals  suffer  such  decomposition  most 
readily.  They  are  decomposed  by  heating  with  zinc  and  water  to 
about  200°  : 

2CnH2n+1I  +  2Zn  +  20H2--=Zn(OH)2  +  Znl2  +  2CnH2n+2  ; 

as  also  by  long  heating  with  concentrated  hydriodic  acid  to  200°-300° : 

oBHtoHi+m=o^fcH.!|+ii 

CnH2nl2  +  2HI=CnH2n+2  +  2I2. 

Instead  of  first  preparing  the  iodide  from  the  alcohol,  the  latter  can 
be  decomposed  directly  by  hydriodic  acid  : 

CnH2n+1OH  +  2HI  =  CnH2n+2  +  OH2  +  I2. 

It  appears  generally  that  by  action  of  saturated  hydriodic  acid 
solution,  all  organic  oxides  are  converted  into  the  corresponding 
paraffins : 

C2H40   +  4HI  =  C2H6  +    H20  +  2I2 

C2H402  +  6HI  =  C2H6  +  2H20  +  3I2. 

By  most  of  the  methods  previously  mentioned  the  paraffins  are 
formed  as  the  hydrides  of  the  alcohol  radicals,  and  they  are  frequently 
referred  to  as  such. 

The  unsaturated  hydrocarbons  are  also  converted  into  paraffins  by 
hydriodic  acid,  hydrogen  being  taken  up  and  iodine  separated  :

The  salts  of  organic  acids  yield  paraffins  when  fused  with  alkalies, 
with  partial  splitting  off  of  carbon  as  carbonate  : 

CnH2n+1.CO.OK  +  HOK  =  K2C03  +  CnH2n+2, 

CnH2n(CO.OK)2  +  2HOK  =  2K2C03  +  CnH2n+2,  etc.

stronger  affinity  for  them,  whereupon  the  several  hydrocarbon  nuclei 
unite  at  the  moment  of  liberation  and  form  new  molecules.  The 
general  type  of  reaction  thus  occurring  is  that  known  as  double  de- 
composition,  as  by  action  of  the  iodides  of  the  alcohol  radicals  upon 
the  corresponding  zinc  compounds  :

A  similar  result  is  obtained  when  the  iodide  or  bromide  of  an 
alcohol  radical,  dissolved  in  an  indifferent  liquid — ether,  &c. — is 
heated  with  potassium  or  sodium  :

When  obtained  by  the  last  two  methods  the  paraffins  appear  as 
the  compounds  of  two  similar  or  different  alcohol  radicals. 

Another  method  belonging  to  this  class  is  the  decomposition  of 
aqueous  solutions  of  salts  of  organic  acids  by  the  electric  current, 
whereby  carbonic  anhydride  and  the  paraffin  appear  at  the  positive 
pole,  and  hydrogen  and  solution  of  the  carbonate  at  the  negative  :

faction, and  therefore  occurs  in  the  slime  of  marshy  waters  in  large 
quantity  (marsh  gas),  very  frequently  in  coal  mines  (tire-damp.) 
some  places  it  streams  in  large  quantity  from  the  ground  e,g,  at 
Baku  on  the  Caspian  Sea,  where  it  has  burnt  since  i  very  remote 
period.

Mixed  with  other  hydrocarbons  it  is  formed  by  the  dry  distillation

It  can  be  prepared  indirectly  from  its  elements  in  two  ways — 
either  by  passing  a  mixture  of  sulphuretted  hydrogen  and  carbonic 
disulphide  vapour  over  glowing  copper,  which  removes  the  sulphur 
from  both  compounds  : 

CS2  +  2SH2  +  8Cu  =  4Cu2S  +  CH4  j 

or  by  action  of  sodium  amalgam  on  carbonic  tetrachloride  in  presence 
of  water  : 

CC14  +  4Na2  +  40H2  =  4NaCl  +  4NaOH  +  CH4. 

Methane  is  a  colourless,  odourless  gas  of  sp.  gr.  -5598 ;  it  is 
slightly  absorbed  by  water.  It  burns  readily  with  a  feebly  luminous 
flame ;  mixed  with  the  requisite  quantity  of  oxygen  (double  its  volume) 
or  atmospheric  air,  it  explodes  on  ignition  with  great  violence  (fire- 
damp) : 

CH4  +  202  =  C02  +  20H2. 

Although  it  does  not  support  respiration,  it  is  destitute  of  poison- 
ous qualities.  Under  the  influence  of  high  temperatures — e.g.  when 
passed  through  white-hot  porcelain  tubes,  or  when  submitted  for  a 
long  time  to  the  action  of  the  elect ric  spark — it  is  partly  decomposed, 
with  increase  of  volume,  into  hydrogen  and  carbon  : 

CH4  =  C  +  2H2. 

When  mixed  in  the  dry  state  with  chlorine,  it  is  not  affected  in 
the  dark  ;  by  heating,  however,  or  by  exposure  to  light,  it  undergoes 
changes  whose  amount  depends  upon  that  of  the  chlorine  present. 

A  mixture  of  one  volume  of  methane  with  two  volumes  of 
chlorine  explodes  powerfully  on  exposure  to  direct  sunlight,  carbon 
being  deposited,  and  hydrochloric  acid  gas  formed  : 

CH4  +  2C12  =  C  +  4HC1. 

If  the  gases  be  mixed  in  equal  volumes,  and  exposed  to  diffused 
daylight,  substitution  of  one  hydrogen  by  one  chlorine  atom  takes 
place,  and  monochlor-methane  or  methylic  chloride  results  : 

CH4  +  Cl2  =  CH3C1  +  HC1. 

Larger  quantities  of  chlorine  by  slow  action — best  and  with  least 


ETHANE,   C2H6.  107 

danger  if  diluted  with  large  quantities  of  carbonic  anhydride — yield 
higher  chlorine  substitution-products : 

CH4  +  2C12  =  2HC1  +  CH2C12    (dichlor-methane,  or  methy- 
lene dichloride), 

CH4  +  3C12  =  3HC1  +  CHCI3     (trichlor-methane,  or  chloro- 
form), 
and  lastly 

CH4  +  4C12  =  4HC1  +  CC1.,      (tetrachlor-methane,  perchlor- 

methane,  or  carbonic  chloride). 

In  the  presence  of  water,  chlorine  decomposes  methane,  slowly  but 
completely,  into  hydrochloric  acid  and  carbonic  anhydride  :

two  butanes  can  exist,  and  both  have  been  prepared. 

Normal  butane,  butylic  hydride,  diethyl,  or  propyl-methyl,  occurs 
in  crude  petroleum,  and  is  formed,  as  diethyl,  by  action  of  zinc  or 
sodium  upon  ethylic  iodide,  or  by  the  decomposition  of  zinc  ethyl  by 
this  latter  in  sealed  tubes  heated  to  at  least  150° :

Butane  is,  at  ordinary  temperatures,  a  colourless  gas  of  ethereal

nearly  insoluble  in  water,  pretty  readily  soluble  in  alcohol,  this  latter 

absorbing  18  times  it  own  volume  at  14°.

General. 

160.  The  monovalent  alcohols,  CnH2n+1.OH,  may  be  arranged 
in  three  classes  according  to  the  position  of  the  carbon  atom  united 
to  hydroxyl  in  the  nucleus,  to  which  methyl  alcohol  or  carbinol,

the  first  member  of  the  series,  may  be  added  as  a  fourth  variety. 

1.  The  primary  alcohols  contain  the  hydroxyl  group  attached  to  a 
terminal  primarily  united  carbon  atom,  which,  therefore,  is  also 
united  to  two  hydrogen  atoms ;  the  group

is  characteristic  of  them.     From  methyl  alcohol  they  are  derived  by

By  action  of  oxidising  agents  upon  them  there  results,  according 
to  the  extent  of  oxidation,  two  products  — namely,  by  action  of  one 
atom  of  oxygen  with  elimination  of  two  hydrogen  atoms,  aldehydes  :

other  carbon  atoms)  j  they  are  therefore  characterised  by  the  group

From   carbinol  they   are   derived    by   replacement  of  two   hydrogen

Oxidising  agents,  as  long  as  the  carbon  chain  is  not  destroyed, 
act  with  only  one  oxygen  atom  upon  the  molecule  of  a  secondary 
alcohol ;  there  results  thereby,  with  removal  of  two  hydrogen  atoms

The  tertiary  alcohols  are  not  capable  of  an  oxidation  similar  to 
that  in  aldehyde  or  ketone  formation ;  by  action  of  powerful  oxidising 
agents  the  nucleus  is  broken  up  into  several  smaller  ones. 

161.  It  is  evident  that  the  structure  of  the  nucleus  must  have 
considerable  influence  on  the  nature  of  the  alcohol ;  there  are  to  be 
distinguished : 

1.  Normal  alcohols,  whose  nuclei  can  contain  only  primarily  and 
secondarily  combined  carbon  atoms,  and  therefore  a  single  chain  with 
only  two  terminal  carbon  atoms.  Normal  alcohols  may  be  primary  or

thau  two  terminal  carbon  atoms. 

There  are  primary,  tertiary,  and  also  secondary  isoalcohols  when

They  also  react  in  many  ways  like  the  hydrates  of  the  monovalent

alkali  metals,  though  with  much  less  energy;  they  unite  pretty 
readily  with  acids  to  saline  compounds  in  which  the  alcohol  radical 
replaces  the  acid  hydrogen.     By  action  of  haloid  adds  upon  them  the 

chlorides  of  the  alcohol  radicals  result  : 

CnH2n+I.OH  +  IT01  =  CnH2n+101  +  Oil,, 
like  KOH  +  HOI  =  KOI  +  011,; 

and  they  yield  with  the  oxyacids  (in  complete  analogy  to  the  oxysalts 
of  alkali  metals)  the  ethereal  salts  : 

C„H2n  +  ,0H  +  HO.N02  =  CnH2n  +  .O.NO,  +  H20; 
like  KOH  +  HO.N02  =  K.0.N02  +  IT.O, 

CnH2n  +1.0H  +  H2S04  =  CnII2n  +  ,.HS04  +  H20; 
like  KOH  +  H2S04  =  K.HS04  +  H20, 

2(CnH2n  +  ,0H)  +  H2S04  =  (CnH2n  +  ,),B0,  +  2H20 ; 
like  2K0H  +  H2S04  =  K2S04  +  2H20,  &c. 

Formation  of  Alcohols. 

163.  Many  alcohols  of  the  series  CnH2n  +  1.0H  occur  in  nature  as 
the  salts  of  organic  acids,  and  indeed  ready  formed  in  plants  and 
animals ;  many  of  them  result  from  the  fermentation  of  saccharine 
bodies  by  an  organised  ferment — yeast — and  then  accompany  ethyl 
alcohol.  In  their  synthetical  preparation  from  the  paraffins  the  use 
of  the  monochlor  substitution  products  of  these  latter  is  indispensable, 
the  conversion  of  the  chloride  into  the  alcohol  being  usually  effected 
in  this  manner  :  the  chloride  is  first  converted  into  the  acetate  by 
heating  with  argentic  or  potassic  acetates  : 

<\,II,MM.C1  +  K0.02H30  =  CnH2n  +  ,.O.C2H80  +  KOI, 

and  this,  on  heating  with  potassic  hydrate  solution,  yields  the  alcohol 
and  potassic  acetate  :

When  the  paraffin  contains  more  than  two  carbon  atoms,  the  first 
action  of  chlorine  produces  isomeric  chlorides,  from  the  mixture  of 
which,  when  heated  in  the  above  way,  secondary,  etc.,  alcohols  are 
obtained  as  well  as  primary.  For  instance,  propane,  by  treatment 
with  chlorine,  yields  simultaneously  primary  and  secondary  propyl ic 
chlorides  :

and  there  are  finally  obtained  both  primary  and  secondary  propylic 

alcohols. 

Many  primary  alcohols  have  only  been  obtained  by  the  action  of 

nascent  hydrogen  upon  those   aldehydes  which  thev  themselves  would 
yield  on  oxidation.

Secondary  alcohols  are  correspondingly  prepared  by  hydrogenising 
ketones.  Primary  alcohols  can  be  converted  into  those  secondary 
alcohols  which  have  the  OH  group  attached  to  the  carbon  atom  next 
to  the  primary  position  in  the  following  manner  : — The  primary  alco- 
hol is  converted  by  dehydrating  agents  (by  heating  with  concentrated 
sulphuric  acid  or  zincic  chloride)  into  a  hydrocarbon,  CnH2n  (olefine)  :

and  the  latter  then  gently  heated  with  concentrated  hydriodic  acid.

The  secondary  alcoholic  iodide  is  then  converted  into  acetate  by 
heating  with  potassic  acetate,  and  finally  into  the  secondary  alcohol 
by  treatment  with  potassic  hydrate. 

This  transformation  can  be  still  more  simply  effected  by  absorbing 
the  olefine  in  concentrated  sulphuric  acid.  By  the  same  law  of  the 
easier  combination  of  negative  elements  or  radicals  to  an  interme- 
diate than  to  a  terminal  carbon  atom,  the  acid  sulphate  formed  is 
that  of  the  secondary  alcohol :

165.  Carbinol,  commonly  called  wood  spirit,  results  from  the  dry 
distillation  of  wood ;  the  aqueous  layer  of  the  distillate  contains  in 
addition  several  other  bodies,  such  as  acetic  acid,  acetone,  &c.  As 
the  boiling  point  of  carbinol  is  considerably  lower  than  that  of  water, 
on  distilling  the  wood-tar  water — previously  mixed  with  lime  to  fix 
the  acetic  acid — all  the  methylic  alcohol  is  contained  in  the  first  tenth 
of  the  distillate.  This  first  fraction  still  contains,  however,  acetone 
and  water ;  to  remove  the  latter  it  is  rectified  over  quick-lime ;  the 
distillate  containing  the  wood  spirit  and  acetone  is  added  to  fused 
calcic  chloride,  which  combines  with  the  first,  so  that  the  unchanged 
acetone,  which  is  readily  volatile,  may  be  driven  off  by  heating  in  a 
water  bath.  The  residue,  the  compound  of  carbinol  and  calcic 
chloride,  is  now  mixed  with  water,  whereby,  with  formation  of 
CaCl2,6H20,  the  carbinol  is  set  free,  and  on  distillation  passes  over, 
together  with  a  little  water.  By  repeated  rectification  over  quick- 
lime it  is  obtained  anhydrous.  In  the  preparation  so  obtained  there 
are  still  some  impurities  adhering  obstinately  to  it,  which  communi- 
cate a  burning  taste.  It  is  obtained  quite  pure  by  conversion  into 
its  oxalate,  which,  being  crystallisable,  is  easily  purified,  and  then 
retransformed  into  the  alcohol  by  potassic  hydrate. 


ETHYLIC  ALCOHOL.  121 

Carbinol  can  also  be  prepared  from  the  ethereal  oil  otgauUheria 
proctcmbens  (the  North  American  winter-green  shrub).  Thin  con- 
tains methylic  salicylate,  mixed  with  hydrocarbons  ;  the  first,  on  boil- 
ing with  an  alkali,  yields  a  salicylate  and  methylic  alcohol. 

( larbinol  is  a  colourless,  mobile,  spirituous-smelling  liquid,  of  sp.  gr. 
•814  at  4°  ;  it  boils  at  60°,  is  readily  inflammable,  and  burns  with  a 
slightly  luminous  flame.  It  mixes  in  every  proportion  with  water, 
ethylic  alcohol,  and  ether,  in  the  first  case  with  diminution  of  volume 
and  evolution  of  heat.  By  oxidising  agents,  e.g.  air  in  contact  with 
platinum  black,  it  is  converted  into  formic  aldehyde  and  formic  acid. 
By  passing  its  vapour  over  healed  soda  lime  a  formate  is  produced  : 

<  H,.OH  +  NaOH  =  CHO.ONa  +  2H2. 

It  is  a  good  solvent  for  many  substances  insoluble  in  water,  such  as 
fats  or  ethereal  oils,  and  for  many  salts  ;  e.g.  calcic  chloride,  especially 
on  heating,  is  dissolved  by  it  in  considerable  quantity  ;  the  saturated 
liquid,  on  cooling,  gives  leafy  crystals  of  a  compound,  in  which  methylic 
alcohol  is  united  to  calcic  chloride  like  water  of  crystallisation.  This 
compound  is  not  decomposed  at  100°.

166.  Ethylic  alcohol,  or  spirits  of  wine,  more  commonly  known  as 
alcohol  only,  results  from  the  fermentation  of  many  saccharine  bodies, 
whereby  these  nearly  entirely  decompose  into  carbonic  anhydride  and 
alcohol : 

C6H1206  =  2C2H60  +  2C02. 

There  are  also  some  other  products  formed,  such  as  succinic  acid, 
glycerine,  and  higher  members  of  the  alcohol  series,  which  latter  are 
known  as  fusel  oils  or  fusel  alcohols. 

The  ferment  essential  to  the  alcoholic  fermentation  is  yeast,  a  one- 
celled  organism,  propagating  by  budding,  which,  under  favourable 
conditions,  causes  the  decomposition  of  the  BUgar  to  oeeur  with  j 
quickness,  and  with  evolution  of  heat,  when  placed  in  contact  with  its 
solutions.  To  the  conditions  necessary  belong  the  temperature,  which 
must  not  be  below  0°  nor  above  35°;  the  presence  both  of  certain 
mineral  substances  (especially  phosphates)  and  of  nitrogenous  organic 
matters,    which    serve    as    food   for   the   yeast  :   and,    finally,   sutlieiVnt 

dilution  of  the  sugar  solution.  If  this  latter  be  too  concentrated  it  is 
either  not  at  all  transformed,  or  the  fermentation  ceases  in  consequence 
of  the  death  of  the  yeast  cells.  A  liquid  containing  more  than  2< 
"o  of  sugar  cannot  ho  completely  fermented  by  yeast.  Many  poison- 
ous substances,  e.g.  phenol,  even  in  small  quantity  in  an  otherwise 
favourably  mixed  solution,  prevent   fermentation  by  killing  the  i 

Cells. 

Alcohol,  which  boils  at  a  lower  temperature  than  water,  can  beob- 
tained  more  pure  from  the  fermented  liquid  by  Pactional  distillation. 
It  is  then  found  in  the  first    fractions,  whilst   water  and  the  nou-vol.i 


122      DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  ALCOHOL  RADICALS,   CnH2n+1. 

tile  matters— namely,  the  yeast  and  the  marc — remain  behind,  the 
latter  retaining  the  chief  portion  of  the  fusel  oils.  By  repeated  frac- 
tional distillation  the  spirit  is  obtained  more  and  more  concentrated, 
and  separated  from  the  still  lower  boiling  admixtures  ('first  runnings '). 
The  strongest  rectified  spirit  still  contains  5-10  %  of  water  and 
some  fusel  oils.  The  first  can  be  removed  by  chemical  means,  the 
latter  by  means  of  filtration  through  porous  carbon. 

As  dehydrating  agents,  all  energetically  hygroscopic  substances 
may  be  employed,  especially  such  as  do  not  combine  with  alcohol — 
e.g.  ignited  potassic  carbonate,  quick-lime,  &c.  Usually  the  strongest 
spirit  is  placed  on  quick-lime  for  24  hours,  with  frequent  shaking, 
then  distilled  from  a  water  bath,  and  the  distillate  heated  anew  in 
similar  manner.  The  last  traces  of  water  are  removed  by  treatment 
with  sodium,  followed  by  distillation. 

The  smallest  traces  of  water  in  alcohol  may  be  detected  by  bringing 
it  in  contact  with  cupric  sulphate,  dried  till  colourless,  when  a  blue 
colouration  indicates  the  presence  of  water. 

167.  Absolute,  i.e.  entirely  anhydrous  and  pure,  ethylic  alcohol  is 
a  colourless,  mobile  liquid  of  agreeable  odour  and  burning  taste,  of 
sp.  gr.  -8063  at  +  4°  and  *7895  at  20°.  It  boils  under  normal  atmo- 
spheric pressure  at  TS'S0,  and  is  still  liquid  at  —  90°.  Easily  in- 
flamed, it  burns  with  a  bluish,  feebly  luminous  flame.  It  is  a  strong 
poison. 

Absolute  alcohol  possesses  a  very  considerable  affinity  for  water ; 
it  therefore  dries  damp  substances  energetically,  and  acts  as  an  anti- 
septic. On  mixing  water  with  alcohol,  heat  is  evolved,  and  contrac- 
tion, i.e.  diminution  of  volume,  takes  place.  This  is  most  consider- 
able when  52'3  volumes  of  alcohol  are  added  to  47'7  volumes  of  water, 
the  volume  of  the  mixture  being  only  96*4.  It  appears  as  if  a  com- 
pound was  formed  of  both  in  molecular  quantities,  as  these  proportions 
are  sufficiently  near  to  be  represented  by  the  formula  C2H60,3H20. 
Alcohol  more  dilute  than  this  does  not  apparently  act  as  a  drying 
agent. 

In  consequence  of  this  diminution  of  volume,  the  alteration  of  the 
sp.  gr.  is  not  proportional  to  that  of  the  mixture,  though  additions  of 
water  increase  the  density.  By  careful  investigations,  the  sp.  gr.  of  a 
large  number  of  synthetically  prepared  mixtures  of  alcohol  and  water 
has  been  determined,  and  by  means  of  tables  so  constructed  the 
amount  of  alcohol  in  any  aqueous  solution  may  be  ascertained  by  de- 
termining the  density. 

This  can  be  done  at  once  in  liquids  containing  no  foreign  matters, 
but  in  cases  where  non- volatile  matters  are  present,  as  in  most  alcoholic 
drinks,  this  method  can  no  longer  be  directly  applied,  and  the  follow- 
ing is  substituted  : — A  given  volume  of  the  solution  to  be  tested  is 
submitted  to  distillation,  the  first  distillates,  which  contain  all  the 
alcohol,  made  up  to  the  original  volume  with  water,  and  the  gravity 
then  determined.  The  gravity  is  most  quickly  determined  by  a  hydro- 
meter, whose  scale,  instead  of  sp.  gr.,  gives  the  corresponding  amount 
of  alcohol,  either  in  %  by  volume  (Tralle's  alcoholometer)  or  in  %  by 
weight  (Bichter's  alcoholometer). 

The  general  relations  between  the  mixed  contents,  by  volume  or  by 
weight,  and  the  sp.  gr.  is  sufficiently  shown  by  the  following  table :

water  at  -f-  4°  being  taken  as  unity. 

Many  substances  are  soluble  in  alcohol ;  these  are  partly  soluble  in 
water  also,  as  calcic  chloride,  strontic  chloride,  lithic  chloride,  many 
nitrates,  &c,  whilst  other  bodies  readily  soluble  in  water,  such  ;is 
potassic  chloride,  sodic  chloride,  the  sulphates  and  carbonates  of  the 
alkali  metals,  &c,  are  either  insoluble  or  difficultly  soluble  in  absolute 
alcohol.  On  the  other  hand,  alcohol  is  a  good  solvent  for  many  bodies 
difficultly  soluble  or  quite  insoluble  in  water,  such  as  iodine,  fatty 
acids,  fats,  alkaloids,  resins,  colouring  matters,  <fec. 

Sulphur  and  phosphorus  are  slightly  soluble  in  it.  It  absorbs 
many  gases  much  more  than  water  does  j  100  volumes  of  alcohol  dis- 
solve at  0°,  7  volumes  hydrogen,  28  volumes  oxygen,  13  volumes 
nitrogen,  52  volumes  methane,  353  volumes  ethylene,  433  volumes 
carbonic  anhydride,  &c. 

Like  methylic  alcohol,  it  unites  with  many  anhydrous  mineral 
salts  after  the  manner  of  water  of  crystallisation,  e.g.  with  calcic 
chloride  and  with  magnesic  nitrate. 

In  commerce  nothing  but  aqueous  alcohol  occurs,  even  that  sold  as 
absolute  still  containing  3-5  %  of  water;  spirits  of  wine  contains  an 
amount  of  alcohol  varying  between  80  and  90  %.  Still  more  dilute 
alcohol  forms — mostly  with  small  admixtures  of  other  volatile 
peculiarly  smelling  bodies — the  different  'spirits,'  of  which  rum  (from 
fermented  sugar  molasses),  arrack  (from  rice),  and  cognac  (distilled  from 
wine)  contain  about  45-50  %  by  volume,  the  true  brandies  only 
about  £-£  of  their  volume  of  alcohol.  Still  poorer  in  alcohol  are 
those  alcoholic  drinks  not  concentrated  by  distillation,  but  prepared 
directly  by  fermentation  of  liquids  containing  sugar,  such  as  wine 
(with  6-15  %  of  alcohol)  and  beer  (in  mean  about  4-5  %  of  alcohol). 
When  drunk  in  aqueous  solution, alcohol  acts  as  an  excitant,  in  larger 
quantities  as  an  intoxicant.  It  passes  from  the  stomach  and  intestines 
into  the  blood,  and  is  there  in  great  part  oxidised,  but  also  passes  in 
small  quantity  through  the  kidneys  into  the  urine.

124      DEKIVATIVES  OF  THE  ALCOHOL  KADICALS,   CnH£n+1. 

1.  Ethyl  carbinol,  or  primary  prop>ylic  alcohol,  occurs,  mixed  with 
ethylic  alcohol  and  higher  homologues,  in  many  fusel  oils,  and  it  can 
be  obtained  directly  therefrom  with  difficulty  in  the  pure  state,  by 
very  carefully  conducted  and  repeated  fractional  distillations.  It  is 
more  convenient  to  convert  that  portion  of  the  fusel  oils  which  distils 
between  85°  and  105°  into  bromides  (by  action  of  phosphorous  bro- 
mide), from  these  to  isolate  propylic  bromide,  boiling  at  71°,  and  then 
to  convert  this  latter  into  the  acetate  (§  163),  which,  by  boiling  with 
an  alkali,  again  yields  the  alcohol. 

Ethyl  carbinol  is  prepared  synthetically  by  acting  upon  propionic 
aldehyde  with  nascent  hydrogen,  upon  propionic  anhydride  with 
sodium  amalgam,  and  by  heating  allylic  alcohol  with  potassic  hydrate. 

It  is  a  colourless,  agreeable- smelling  liquid,  boiling  at  97°  and  of 
sp.  gr.  '812.  It  is  miscible  in  every  proportion  with  water,  but  is  sepa- 
rated again  from  this  solution  by  addition  of  readily  soluble  salts,  such 
as  calcic  chloride.  By  oxidation  it  is  converted  into  propionic  alde- 
hyde and  propionic  acid. 

2.  Dimethyl  carbinol,  secondary  propylic  alcohol,  or  isopropylic 
alcohol,  is  usually  prepared  by  action  of  sodium  amalgam  upon 
aqueous  acetone  : 

CH,  CH3

CH3  CH-3 

For  this  purpose  a  mixture  of  one  part  acetone  and  five  parts  water 
is  heated  with  sodium  amalgam  until  a  light  layer  separates  upon  the 
surface  of  the  strongly  alkaline  liquid.  The  liquid  is  decanted  from 
the  mercury  and  distilled  as  long  as  anything  inflammable  passes  over; 
the  distillate  is  then,  after  addition  of  water,  again  heated  with  sodium 
amalgam,  &c,  and  this  treatment  continued  until  addition  of  the 
amalgam  causes  strong  evolution  of  hydrogen.  The  distillate  is  then 
rectified  over  ignited  potassic  carbonate,  in  order  to  render  it  anhy- 
drous, and  the  portion  distilling  below  100°  rubbed  together  with 
anhydrous  calcic  chloride.  A  compound  of  this  latter  with  isopropylic 
alcohol  is  formed,  which  is  mixed  with  acetone.  Under  the  receiver 
of  an  air  pump  the  acetone  evaporates,  leaving  the  compound  of  calcic 
chloride  and  dimethyl  carbinol  as  a  dry  powder.  By  heating  in  a 
retort  this  decomposes  into  its  components  and  the  alcohol  distils 
over. 

Of  other  methods  of  preparing  dimethyl  carbinol  there  may  be 
mentioned  its  formation  from  the  iodide  obtained  from  glycerine  and 
from  propylene  (see  later). 

Dimethyl  carbinol  is  a  colourless  liquid  of  sp.  gr.  '791  at  15°,  boiling

1.  Propyl  carbinol,  or  normal  primary  butylic  alcohol,  is  obtained 
by  action  of  nascent  hydrogen  upon  normal  butyric  aldehyde.  It 
results  also  from  the  action  of  sodium  amalgam  upon  a  mixture  of 
normal  butyric  acid  and  its  chloride,  as  butylic  butyrate,  which  yields 
the  alcohol  on  boiling  with  an  alkali. 

Propyl  carbinol  is  a  colourless,  agreeable-smelling  liquid,  miscible 
in  every  proportion  with  alcohol,  but  not  with  water.  On  oxidation 
it  yields  normal  butyric  aldehyde  or  acid. 

2.  Ethyl- methyl  carbinol,  normal  secondary  butylic  alcohol,  or  buty- 
lene  hydrate,  is  most  readily  prepared  from  its  iodide  by  converting 
into  the  acetate  and  saponifying  the  latter.  Secondary  butylic  iodide 
was  first  prepared  by  action  of  concentrated  hydriodic  acid  upon 
erythrite. 

It  is  also  obtained  from  the  so-called  bichlorether  (§  207),  when 
this  is  heated  with  zinc  ethyl  :

ketone  or  propionic  and  acetic  acids. 

4.  Isobutyl  carbinol,  ox  first  primary  isoamylic  alcohol,  is  the  longest 
known  fermentation  amylic  alcohol.  It  occurs  invariably  in  fusel 
oils,  especially  in  that  from  potato  spirit,  and  is  separated  from  them 
by  fractional  distillation  as  an  unpleasant,  fusel -like-smelling  liquid 
of  sp.  gr.  -825  at  0°,  boiling  at  1 29°-l  30°.  It  is  scarcely  soluble  in  water, 
but  mixes  in  every  proportion  with  alcohol  and  ether.  Its  vapour, 
when  inhaled,  causes  coughing  and  acts  as  a  poison.  When  quickly 
fractioned  from  fusel  oil  it  rotates  the  plane  of  polaiisation  to  the 
left  slightly,  but  loses  its  optical  activity  on  heating  for  a  long  time, 
or  quickly  if  distilled  from  caustic  alkali,  without  apparently  under- 
going any  chemical  change.  The  property  of  optical  activity,  indeed, 
appears  to  belong  not  to  the  usual  isoamlyic  alcohol,  but  to  a  small 
quantity  of  an  isomer  (71)  mixed  with  it.  By  oxidising  agents  iso- 
amylic alcohol  is  converted  into  isovaleric  aldehyde  and  acid. 

5.  Methyl-isopropyl  carbinol,  secondary  isoamylic  alcohol,  also 
termed  amylene  hydrate,  is  obtained  from  the  isoamylene,  prepared 
by  heating  4  with  zincic  chloride,  by  uniting  it  with  hydriodic  acid, 
and  then  converting  the  secondary  isoamylic  iodide  so  obtained 
into  the  alcohol  by  means  of  moist  argentic  oxide.  It  boils  at 
106°-108°,  and  its  vapour,  on  heating  to  200°,  splits  up  into  iso- 
amylene and  water :

It  suffers  the  same  decomposition  when  mixed  with  sulphuric

oxidised  to  carbonic  and  acetic  acids.

171.  Of  the  (16)  possible  hexylic  alcohols  only  some  are  known  of 
still  in  part  doubtful  constitution. 

1.  Amyl  carbinol,  or  normal  primary  hexylic  alcohol  :

CH3.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH(OH),CrT3, 

by  treatment  of  the  mixed  first  chlor-substitution  products  of  normal 
hexane  with  potassic  acetate,  and  saponification  of  the  resulting  ace- 
tates. The  mixture  of  alcohols  so  formed,  boiling  at  149°— 152°, 
yields  on  oxidation  caproic  acid,  CH3.CH2.CHQ.CH2.CH2.CO.OH, 
and  methyl-butyl  ketone,  CH3.CH2.CH2.CH2.UO.CH3. 

In  the  pure  state  it  is  obtained  from  the  ethereal  oil  of  Hera- 
cleum  giganteum,  which  consists  of  hexylic  butyrate  and  octylic  ace- 
tate ;  by  treatment  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  the  alcohols  are 
liberated,  and  are  then  separated  by  fractional  distillation ;  it  boils  at 
157°-158°,  has  sp.  gr.  *819  at  23°,  and  gives  normal  caproic  acid  on 
oxidation. 

2.  Mrthyl-butyl  carbinol,  or  first  normal  secondary  hexylic  alcohol, 
CH3.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH(OH).OH3,  is  prepared  from  its  iodide  (ob- 
tained by  distilling  mannite  with  hydriodic  acid)  :

as  it  yields  the  same  oenanthic  acid  on  oxidation  as  the  normal  pri- 
mary alcohol  from  normal  heptane.  This  latter  alcohol  boils  at 
170°— 172°.  At  the  same  time  that  its  chloride  is  formed  from  normal 
heptane,  a  secondary  chloride  is  also  formed,  from  which  a  normal 
secondary  heptylic  alcohol  or  methyl-amyl  carbinol :

Xonylic  Alcohol,  C9H20O  or  C9H19.OH. 

174.  At  present  there  is  only  a  single  body  of  this  formula  known  ; 
it  is  prepared  from  petroleum  nonane,  boils  at  about  200°,  and  is  pro- 
bably mcthyl-heptyl  carbinol. 

Decatylk  Alcohol,  C10H22O  =  C10H21.OH. 

175.  The  only  alcohol  of  this  formula  known  with  any  certainty  is 
that  obtained  by  action  of  zinc  ethyl  upon  bromacetic  bromide,  and 
has  probably  the  constitutional  formula  :

Its  boiling  point  is  very  low — namely,  155°- 15  7°. 

176.  Alcohols  of  the  formulae 

CnH240,  CjoHoeO,  C]3H2sO,  C14H30O,  and  CISH320 

have  not  yet  been  prepared,  but  there  are  some  higher,  naturally 
occurring  members  of  the  series  known ;  about  whose  constitution  no- 
thing is  ascertained. 

177.  Cetylic  alcohol,  or  ethal,  ClbH340  =  C16H33.OH,  is  prepared 
from  spermaceti  (cetylic  palmitate)  by  long  boiling  with  alcoholic 
potassic  hydrate  : 

C16H33.O.C16H310  +  KOH  =  C16H33OH  +  KO.C16H31.0. 

After  the  action  is  finished,  the  cetylic  alcohol  is  precipitated  by  addi- 
tion of  water  (in  which  potassic  palmitate  is  soluble)  and  purified  by 
crystallisation  from  alcohol. 

Ethal  so  obtained  crystallises  in  leaves,  fuses  at  49°-50°,  and  by 
careful  heating,  best  in  a  stream  of  gas,  can  be  slowly  volatilised.  It 
is  completely  insoluble  in  water. 

178.  Cerylic  alcohol,  C27H560  =  CS7H5S.OH,  forms  as  its  cero- 
tate  the  chief  constituent  of  Chinese  wax,  from  which  it  can  be  pre- 
pared in  manner  similar  to  that  of  cetylic  alcohol  from  spermaceti. 
It  is  more  usual  to  fuse  the  Chinese  wax  with  potassic  hydrate  con- 
taining a  little  water  : 

H530  +  KOH  =  C27H55.OH  +  C27H51O.OK, 

and  to  then  extract  the  potassic  cerotate  from  the  cooled  mass  with 
water.  The  undissolved  cerylic  alcohol  is  then  purified  by  crystalli- 
sation from  ether.  It  fuses  at  79°  and  solidifies  on  cooling  to  a  wax-

.oid  Compounds  of  the  Alcohol  Radk 

180.  As  already  mentioned,  the  halogen  compounds  of  the  mono- 
valent alcohol  radicals  can  be  partly  prepared  from  the  paraffins  by 
direct  substitution  of  a  hydrogen  atom  by  a  halogen  atom  ;  but,  as 
fluorine  is  unknown  in  the  free  state,  and  as  iodine  acts  upon  them 
with  little  energy,  this  method  of  preparation  from  the  hydrocarbons 
luced  to  one  for  chlorides  and  bromides  only.  The  procedure 
has  been  already  given. 

The  alcohols  are  the  materials  generally  employed  in  the  prepara- 
tion of  these  bo 

The  reaction  is  analogous  to  the  conversion  of  metallic  hydrates 
into  halogen  compounds  by  action  of  the  haloid  acids  : 

B  , .  ^OH  +  HF  =  CnH,n  +  ,  F  +  H.,0 
i.OH  +  HC1  =  CnHonilCl  +  H  *  I 
1  :._1.OH  +  HBr  =  CnII.I1.tlBr  +  B 
Ln  +  l.OH  +  HI  =  CnH.2n+1I  +  HtO 

The  usual  method  is  as  follows  :  the  alcohol,  rendered  as  anhy- 
drous as  possible,  is  saturated  with  the  gaseous  acid  (of  which  i* 
very  powerful  absorbent),  the  reaction  being  assisted  by  the  applica- 
tion of  heat,  and  the  mixture  then  separated  by  fractional  distillation, 
if  the  boiling  points  of  the  alcohol  and  haloid  salt  permit  :  or  if  the 
alcohol  be  soluble  in  water,  and  the  haloid  salt  insoluble,  this  I 
can  be  precipitated  by  addition  of  water,  separated  mechanically  from 
the  aqueous  alcoholic  layer,  and  purified  by  distillation. 

Instead  of  preparing  the  ad  o  other  vessels,  and  then  con- 

ducting them  into  the  alcohol,  the  preparation  and  action  are  often 
conveniently  combined.  By  gently  heating  an  alcohol  with  common 
s  ilt  and  sulphuric  acid,  there  results,  e.g.,  an  alcoholic  chlori 

M,n  +  1.OH  +  NaCa  +  H,S04  =  CnH2n+1Cl  +  I  +  H20. 

The  equation  given  expresses  the  reaction  of  the  ingredien* 
far  as  they  ensue— truly,   but  the  number  of  reacting  molecule- 
no  means  con  i  the  whole  mass  emph  1  number 
of  molecules  of  alcohol  and  haloid  add,  brought  into  reaction,  j 
under  no  circumstances  the  same  number  of  mol  pro- 
ducts, as  in  every  case  ;i  certain  number 

remain  unchanged.     The  true  result  is  theref  -sed  according 

to  the  following  equation  : 

M.OH  +  aHCl=  hbUfi 


134       DERIVATIVES   OF  THE   ALCOHOL   RADICALS,    C.JT,^,. 

wherein  the  relative  values  of  a  and  b  depend  on  the  one  hand  on 
the  amount  of  affinity,  on  the  other  on  the  temperature.  The  rela- 
tive proportion  of  the  ingredients  at  starting  has  also  an  essential 
influence  on  the  yield,  i.e.  the  relative  quantities  of  the  end  products. 
If  it  is  desired,  for  instance,  to  convert  as  much  as  possible  of  the 
alcohol  employed  into  the  haloid  salt,  it  is  needful  to  bring  as  much 
acid  as  possible  into  the  reaction  ;  this  latter,  however,  would  be  itself 
more  completely  converted  if  the  alcohol  were  in  large  excess. 

The  conversion  of  an  alcohol  into  the  haloid  salt  is  effected  far 
more  readily  by  use  of  the  haloid  compounds  of  sulphur  or  phos- 
phorus, instead  of  the  haloid  acids,  as  these  exchange  halogen  for 
oxygen  or  hydroxyl,  with  much  greater  readiness  than  is  the  case 
with  the  hydrogen  haloids.  The  phosphorus  haloids  generally  are  em- 
ployed, of  which  the  pentachloride  and  pentabromide  react  very  com- 
pletely ;  e.g. 

PC15  +  CnH2n+1.OH  =  CnH2n  +  1.Cl  +  POCI3.  +  HC1. 

The  phosphorus  compounds  give  up  the  whole  of  the  halogen 
easily,  so  that  larger  quantities  of  the  alcohols  can  be  attacked  : 

PC15  +  4CnH2n+1.OH  =  PO(QH3)  +■  HC1  +  4CnH2n+1Cl, 

the  haloid  acid  also  being  able  to  act  on  further  quantities  of  the 
alcohol ;  but  by  so  working  a  large  quantity  of  the  alcohol  is  invaria- 
bly lost,  as  for  as  the  intended  conversion  into  haloid  is  concerned, 
the  phosphoric  acid  formed  attacking  the  alcohol  with  formation  of 
ethereal  phosphates  and  at  the  same  time  of  water,  whose  presence 
prevents  the  completion  of  the  desired  reaction. 

The  same  objections  apply  to  the  use  of  phosphorous  trichloride, 
that  leading  to  the  formation  of  phosphites  and  water. 

A  simple  method,  especially  for  the  preparation  of  secondary  and 
tertiary  iodides,  consists  in  the  addition  of  the  elements  of  the  haloid 
acids  to  the  defines,  the  hydrocarbons  of  the  series  CnH2n,  of  which 
method  frequent  mention  has  already  been  made  (§  163,  kc.) 

General  Properties. 

181.  The  haloid  compounds  of  the  alcohol  radicals  are  without 
exception  colourless,  generally  agreeable-snielling  liquids,  far  less 
soluble  in  water  than  the  corresponding  alcohols.  They  are  miscible 
with  alcohol  in  every  proportion.  By  water  they  are  decomposed  to 
some  extent,  the  reaction  being  the  reverse  to  that  of  their  forma- 
tion : 

aCaH2B+1Cl  +  6HOH  =  cCnH,n+  ,.OH 
+  cHCl  +  (a-c)CnH2n+1.Cl  +  (Vc)H20. 

The  reaction  can  be  rendered  nearly  complete  by  employing  the  water 
in  very  large  excess,  and  assisting  the  reaction  by  heat. 

The  alkalies — best  in  alcoholic  solution — act  more  energetically 
than  water  on  these  salts,  the  alcohol  being  thereby  partly  re- 
generated : 

CnH2n+1Cl  +  KOH  =  KCl  +  CnH2n  +  1.OH. 

But  to  a  much  greater  extent  the  hydroxyl  of  the  alkaline  hydrates 
acts   as   an  oxidising  agent,  and,  instead  of  attaching  itself   to  the 


ALKYLIC  CHLORIDE^   C^B  133 

carbon,  removes  the  hydrogen  atom  from  the  neighbouring  carbon 
atom,  with  formation  of  water  and  an  olefine :

Usually  and  most  completely  the  alcoholic  iodides  are  reconverted 
into  the  alcohols  by  treatment  with  moist  freshly  precipitated  argentic 
oxide  : 

CnH2n  +  1I  +  AgOH  =  Agl  +  CnH2n  +  I.OII; 

still  better  by  heating  with  potassic  acetate  and  subsequent  saponifica- 
tion with  alkali  (§  163). 

182.  The  alcoholic  haloid  salts  can  be  reconverted  into  the 
paraffins  by  treatment  with  nascent  hydrogen,  especially  in  presence 
of  strongly  positive  metals ;  the  iodides,  in  addition,  by  heating  with 
concentrated  hydriodic  acid  (§   149)  or  with  zinc  and  water  :

The  fluorides  of  the  alcohol  radicals,  formed  by  pa-sing  hydro- 
fluoric acid  into  the  alcohols,  are  scarcely  known.

this  and  analogous  cases  is  much  facilitated,  and  rendered  more  com- 
plete, by  the  presence  of  powerful  dehydrating  agents,  especially  by 
zincic  chloride.  It  also  results  from  the  continued  heating  of  a

like  all  chlorine  compounds,  with  a  green-bordered  flame.  It  is  little 
soluble  in  water  (in  50-60  parts),  but  in  all  proportions  in  absolute 
alcohol.  With  chlorine  in  daylight  it  gives  higher  substitution  pro- 
ducts :  C2H4C12,  C2H3C13,  C2H2C14,  C2HC15,  and  finally  C2C16. 

185.  Two  propylic  chlorides  are  known  corresponding  to  the  for-

188.  The  bromine  compounds  of  the  alcohol  radicals  are  mostly 
prepared  by  action  of  phosphoric  bromide  on  the  alcohols.  [nstead 
of  first  preparing  that  body  in  the  pure  state,  and  then  bringing  it  in 
contact  with  the  alcohol,  it  is  more  convenient  to  pour  over  one  pari 
of  amorphous  phosphorus  six  times  its  weight  of  the  alcohol,  and 
then  to  add  slowly  about  six  parts  of  bromine  with  continued  shaking 
and  careful  cooling.  The  bromide  is  separated  from  the  alcohol  by

Iodides  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals,  <  "nll-jn+il* 

189.  The  iodides  of  the  alcohol  radicals  can  all  be  prepared  from 
the  corresponding  alcohols ;  the  usual  method  is  exactly  the  same  as 
that  given  for  the   bromides.     It   consists   in    placing  one  pari  of 

amorphous  phosphorus   in   five  to  ten   parts  of  the  alcohol,  and    dis- 
tilling after  addition  of  ten  parts  of  iodine. 

Instead  of  amorphous  phosphorus  the  ordinary  modification  can 
be  employed;  the  method   of  proceeding   will   be  described  under 

ethylic  iodide.

pared  from  the  respective  defines  (CnH2n)  by  heating  with  concen- 
trated hydriodic  acid  (§  163).  At  higher  temperatures  the  secondary 
compounds  easily  decompose  again  into  the  define  and  hydriodic 
acid. 

All  these  iodides  turn  brown  on  exposure  to  light,  from  separation 
of  iodine,  a  paraffin  being  formed  at  the  same  time  : 

2CnH2n+1I  =  12  +  ^nH2n+2. 

190.  Jlethylic  iodide,  CH3I,  is  a  colourless,  sweet-smelling  liquid, 
nearly  insoluble  in  water,  boils  at  44°-45°,  and  has  sp.  gr.  2*199. 

191.  Ethylic  iodide,  CH3.CH2I,  can  be  prepared  as  follows  :  A 
mixture  of  one  part  phosphorus  with  four  parts  absolute  alcohol  is 
placed  in  a  retort  connected  with  an  inverted  condenser,  and  ten 
parts  of  iodine,  either  solid  or  dissolved  in  alcohol,  gradually  added. 
Phosphorous  iodide  is  formed  with  evolution  of  heat,  which  immedi- 
ately reacts  on  the  alcohol,  the  liquid  generally  entering  into  spon- 
taneous ebullition.  It  is  finally  gently  heated  on  the  water  bath  for 
an  hour,  and  the  product  distilled  off.  The  distillate  is  then  shaken 
with  water  to  remove  alcohol,  and  the  separated  iodide  dried  over 
calcic  chloride  and  distilled. 

Ethylic  iodide  is  a  colourless,  strongly  refractive  liquid  of  pleasant

Metallic  Alcoholates,  CnH2n+1.OM. 

197.  The  hydroxylic  hydrogen  of  alcohols  is  only  replaced  directly, 
with  evolution  of  hydrogen  gas,  by  the  most  strongly  positive  metals, 
and  then  always  with  less  energy  than  in  the  action  of  the  metal  upon 
water.  The  metallic  alcoholates  so  formed  are  solid  bodies,  in 
great  part  readily  soluble  in  alcohol,  are  capable  of  standing  high 
temperatures  without  decomposition,  but  are  very  readily  decomposed 
by  water.  If  a  metallic  alcoholate  be  treated  with  water,  it  is  con- 
verted into  hydrate,  with  considerable  evolution  of  heat.  Unless, 
however,  the  water  he  in  great  excess  the  decomposition  is  not  com- 
plete, and  can  be  represented  by  the  general  equation  : 

»CnH2n+l.ONa  +  aHOH  =yCnH2n+1.OH  +  y^aOK 

+  (z-2/)CnH2n+1ONa  +  (aj-yJHOH, 

in  which  y,  by  employment  of  equal  molecules  of  the  ingredients,  is 
invariably  considerably  greater  than  ^  x. 

The  decomposition  is  naturally  diminished  by  addition  of  alcohol, 
as  in  reverse  action,  on  bringing  together  the  strongest  metallic  bases 
and  alcohols,  some  amount  of  metallic  alcoholates  are  formed  :

The  alcoholates  can  never  be  obtained  pure  by  this  last  reaction ; 
but  their  formation  is  placed  beyond  doubt  by  some  of  the  reactions 
of  the  solutions  of  strong  metallic  hydrates  in  absolute  alcohol,  as,  for 
instance,  the  formation  of 'metallic  alkylic  carbonates  on  passing  car- 
bonic anhydride. 

These  compounds  are  scarcely  known  in  the  case  of  the  heavy 
metals,  except  those  of  aluminium  and  zinc,  which  latter  result  from 
the  slow  oxidation  of  zinc  alkyls  by  atmospheric  oxygen  :

The  best  known  member  of  the  series  is 

198.  Sodic  e%fofe,C,Hf.O.Na==  CH3.CH2.O.Na.  This  is  readily 

obtained  by  placing  one  part  of  bright  metallic  sodium  in  ten  parts  of 
quite  anhydrous  alcohol.  Hydrogen  is  given  off  violently,  and  so 
much  heat  is  evolved  that  either  the  vessel  must  be  cooled  or  else  the 
metal  added  in  small  quantities  and  slowly.  The  whole  of  the  alcohol 
cannot  be  converted  into  its  sodium  derivative  by  this  means.  In  order 
to  obtain  a  pure  product,  when  all  action  has  ceased,  the  excess  of 
alcohol  is  removed  by  distillation  from  a  water  bath  ;  a  white  crys- 
talline mass  remains,  which  is  a  compound  of  one  molecule  of  sodic 
ethylate  with  two  molecules  of  alcohol,  C2H5.01Sra,2C2H5.OH. 
Either  by  long  exposure  in  a  vacuum  or  by  heating  to  200°  in  a  cur- 
rent of  hydrogen,  this  compound  is  resolved  into  alcohol,  which  vola- 
tilises, and  a  white,  very  voluminous  residue  of  sodic  ethylate, 
C2H5.ONa,  which  is  not  decomposed  by  a  temperature  of  290°.

199.  The  ethers  are  compounds  of  two  alcohol  radicals  with  one 
oxygen  atom;  they  can  be  regarded  as  alcohols  whose  hydroxylic 
hydrogen  atom  has  been  replaced  by  an  alcohol  radical  They  can  be 
divided  into  two  groups,  the  first  or  simple  ethers  containing  two 

similar    alcohol  radicals,    whilst    in    the    BeOOnd,    the    BO-Called    W1 

ethers,  two  dissimilar  alcohol  radicals  are  united  together  by  oxygen. 

In  this  way  many  more  ethers  are  possible  than  alcohols.  The  general 
formula  of  the  ethers  : 

'    n'  >  jn  M-      ■     m'  '  jm  +  I   =  '    n  + m'  '  •_■  ii  |  m    ,  i~  )  —  *    n'<  '  .n+  j'  '  («    ■  +  ■    n  K 

being  identical  with  thai   of  the  alcohols,  uumen  of  meta- 

merism must  occur  between  members  of  the  two  classes  of  bodies, 

200.  Methods  of  Preparation,     All   ethers  can  be  prepared  by 

action  of  metallic  alooholates  upon  the  haloid  compounds  of  the 
alcohol  radicals.  Of  the  first  the  sodium  compounds  are  best  em- 
ployed ;  of  the  last,  the  easily  decomposable  iodides;  the  action  then 
stalling  without,  application  of  he.it,  but  can  be  accelerated  and 
finished  by  hi  ating. 


142       DERIVATIVES   OF   THE   ALCOHOL   RADICALS,   CnH„1+1. 

If  a  sodic  alcoholate  be  heated  with  the  iodide  of  the  same  alcohol 
radical,  a  simple  ether  is  formed  : 

CnH2n+1.ONa  +  ICnH2n+1  =  Nal  +  CnH2u  +  1.O.CnH2n+ , 

or  (OnH2n+1)20; 

whilst  the  derivatives  of  different  alcohol  radicals  give  mixed  ethers, 
it  being,  as  regards  the  end  product,  a  matter  of  indifference  which 
alcohol  radical  is  employed  as  the  sodium  oxy derivative  and  which  as 
the  haloid  salt  : 

CnH2n  +  1.ONa  +  ICmH2m+1  =  tfal  +  CnHw+1.O.CmH2M+l> 
or  CnH2n+1.I  +  CmH,m+1.ONa  =  NaI  +  CnH2n+1.0.(,mTi,.m+i. 

As  a  rule  the  sodic  alcoholate  is  not  employed  pure,  but  dissolved 
in  an  excess  of  the  alcohol.  The  ether  must  in  every  case  be  purified 
by  distillation. 

The  only  cases  where  good  yields  are  obtained  by  this  process  are 
the  mixed  methyl  ethers,  prepared  from  methylic  iodide  and  sodic 
alcoholates ;  the  higher  homologous  iodides  so  reacting  with  the 
alcoholates  as  in  great  part  to  produce  olefines  : 

CnH2n+1I  -f  NaO.CmH2m+1  =  NaI  +  HO.CmH2m+1  +  CnH2n. 

Those  salts  of  alcohol  radicals  with  acids,  which  are  not  volatile 
without  decomposition,  and  better  the  acid  than  the  neutral  salts, 
yield  ethers  and  free  acids  when  heated  with  alcohol  to  high  tempera- 
tures : 

C!n"H2n+1.HS04  +  CnH2n+1.OH=  H2S04  +  (CnH2n+i)20 
and 

CnH2n+1.HS04  +  C<mH2m  + 1.0H  =  H2S04 -f  CnH2n  +  1.O.CmH2m+ 1# 

Monethylic  sulphate,  for  instance,  when  heated  with  ethyl  ic 
alcohol  to  about  140°,  decomposes  into  diethylic  oxide  and  sulphuric 
acid  : 

C2H5.HS04  +  C2H5.OH  =  H2S04  +  (C2H5)20. 

The  simple  ethers  can  also  be  prepared  by  heating  the  haloid 
compounds  of  the  alcohol  radicals  with  the  anhydrous  oxides  of  basic 
metals,  most  readily  by  employment  of  iodides  and  argentic  oxide  : 

2CnH,n+1I  +  Ag20  =  Ag2I2  +  (CnH2n+1)20. 

The  method  most  frequently  employed  for  preparing  the  simple 
ethers  consists  in  heating  the  respective  alcohols  with  sulphuric  acid. 
Bearing  in  mind  only  the  ingredients  and  the  final  products,  the  re- 
action may  be  represented  by  the  equation  : 

2CnH.2n  +  1.OH  +  H2S04  =  (CnH2n+1)X>  +  H2S04  +  OH2, 

in  which  the  process  appears  as  the  splitting  off  of  a  molecule  of  water, 
from  two  molecules  of  alcohol,  by  the  dehydrating  power  of  the  sul- 
phuric acid — a  view  which  was  formerly  held.  As  a  matter  of  fact  it 
is  quite  different,  being  essentially  the  same  as  the  second  method 
mentioned  above.  During  the  preparation  of  ether  by  heating  an 
alcohol  with  sulphuric  acid,  it  is  found  that  water  distils  over  before 
the  ether,  although  the  latter  may  have  a  lower  boiling  point  ;  and, 
further,  a  very  small  quantity  of  sulphuric  acid  can  decompose  a  very 


l'KKI'AKA  I  iuN    OF    1:1  HERS.  ]  13 

considerable  quantity  of  alcohol.     Both  facte  completely  contradict  the 

old  view. 

The  formation  of  ether  by  this  process  belongs  to  the  most  intri- 
cate but  at  the  same  time  most  instructive  chemical  processes;  it  is 
therefore  worth  considering  at  some  length. 

201.  Preparation  of  Ethers  from  Alcohols  and  Sulphuric  Acid.  (  ha 
mixing  an  alcohol  with  sulphuric  acid,  an  acid  sulphate  of  the  alcohol 
radical  is  formed  with  evolution  of  beat.  The  process  is  by  no  means 
complete,  the  greater  portion  of  both  ingredients  remaining  un- 
changed : 

oOnH2ll+1.OB  +  MLS04  =  a:C„H,II+1.IlS04  +  x\\J) 

On  applying  heat,  water  and  s  part  of  the  unaltered  alcohol  distil 
over,  until  the  temperature  reaches  that  at  which  ether  is  formed 
cording  to  the  second  method  (by  the  action  of  an  alcohol  on  an  acid 
sulphate),  when  ether  oceans  amongst  the  products  distilling,  and  its 
formation  continues  as  long  as  the  liquid  contains  both  alcohol  and 
acid  sulphate. 

In  the  last  phase  of  the  process,  as  soon  as,  by  the  continued  ex- 
ternal application  of  heat,  the  temperature  rises  above  that  necessary 
for  the  formation  of  ether,  and  when  the  free  alcohol  is  nearly  ex- 
hausted, large  quantities  of  an  olefine  are  formed,  due  to  the  decom- 
position of  the  acid  sulphate  : 

CnH2n+1HS04  =  CnH2n  +  H2S04. 

A>  by  these  decompositions  the  sulphuric  acid  is  regenerated  and 
remains  behind  in  the  residue  from  the  distillation,  this  latter  can 
be  used  again  and  again  for  ether  formation,  the  necessary  fresh 
quantities  of  alcohol  being  added. 

Instead  of  adding  alcohol  from  time  to  time,  the  process  may  be 
made  continuous.     For  this  purpose  the  alcohol  and  sulphuric  acid 
are  mixed  together  in  such  proportions,  that  the  mixture  begu 
boil  at  the  temperature  necessary  for  the  formation  of  ether  ;  ale 
is  then  allowed  to  How  continuously  into  the  apparat 
that  a  thermometer  immersed  in  the  liquid  shows  a  constant  temp 

turc  under  the  OOnl  inued  boiling  ;  there  is  then  as  much  alcohol  passing 

into  the  vessel  as  distils  from  it  in  the  same  time,  in   the  forme 
ether,  water,  or  unaltered  alcohol. 

Kg.  17  shows  the  apparatus  used  on  the  Bmall  scale.  The  flask, 
supported  by  a  tripod  stand  over  a  gas  flame,  is  provided  w  ith  a  triply 

bored  cork  ;   one  opening  contains  the  tube  d  leading  to  the  condenser 

r. ;  the  second  is  for  the  thermometer  6,  which  dips  into  the  liquid ; 

through  the  third  a  funnel  tube  |  irly  to  the  bottom 

Of  the  flask.       As  soon  as  the  boiling  alcohol  acid  mixture  has  reached 

the  desired  temperature,   the  cock  r  of  the  alcohol   reservoir  ■  is 

opened  to  such  an    extent    that    the   annum!   of  alcohol    flowing  down 

the  funnel  tube  into  the  liquid  -hall   keep  the  temperature  at    the 

same  point. 

The  process  might  be  interminable  were  it  not  thai  small  quanti- 
se of  the  acid  are  changed  in  an  unregenerable  manner,  there  not 
only  being  ,i  continual  distillation  of  small  quantitif

pounds  of  sulphuric  acid,  but  also  oxidation  occurs  at  the  expense  of 
the  sulphuric  acid,  so  that  small  quantities  of  sulphurous  anhydride 
are  always  evolved. 

The  distillate  collected  in  the  receiver  separates  into  two  layers, 
the  lower  consisting  mainly  of  water,  the  upper  of  ether.  The  latter 
is  purified  first  by  shaking  with  milk  of  lime,  then  repeatedly  with 
fresh  quantities  of  water,  in  order  to  remove  any  alcohol  that  may

have  passed  over,  and  finally,  after  drying  with  calcic  chloride,  is  sub- 
mitted to  fractional  distillation. 

Many  other  not  readily  volatile  acids,  such  as  phosphoric,  arsenic, 
boric,  &c.,  act  in  a  similar  manner  to  sulphuric  acid. 

202.  SmaU  quantities  of  ether  are  also  obtained  by  heating  the

therefore  also,  together  with  alcohols,  when  the  haloid  salts  are  heated

until  a  point  of  equilibrium  is  reached   in  the  relative  quantities  of 
the  ingredient*  and  products.    This  point  depends  on  the  temperature, 
the  quantities  of  the  ingredients  af  starting,  and  the  relative  affin 
coming  into  play. 

The  formation  of  ethers  by  strongly  heating  alcohols  n  ith 
chlorides,  bromides,  iodides,  and  neutral  sulphates  of  weak  basic 
metals,  such  as  zinc,  tin,  mercury,  aluminium,  iron,  uranium,  <fcc,  was 
formerly  of  special  interest.  It  is  known  that  nearly  all  these  bodies, 
when  heated  to  high  temperatures  with  water,  are  partly  decomposed 
into  free  acids  and  basic  salts,  especially  when  the  acid  can  volatilise; 
for  instance,  A1,C1,;  +  2Ha0  =  4H01  +  A1202C12.  In  every  ease 
these  salts  are  more  readily  decomposed  by  alcohols,  the  negative  con- 
stituent forming  a  compound  with  the  alcohol  radical.  Zincic  chlorido 
heated  with  alcohol  always  yields  some  alcoholic  chloride  : 

sZnCl,  +  yCnHan+1.OH  =  ^Zn<^H+^CnH2n+1.Cl  +(x-z)ZnClt 

+  (y-*)CnH2n+1.OH. 

Normal  aluminic  sulphate  yields  a  basic  salt  and  acid  sulphate  of  the 
alcohol  radical,  according  to  the  equation  : 

*Al2(S04)3  +  yCnH2n  +  1.OH  =  «Ala(S04)(OH),  4-  2:<  ,„H,n  + ^HSO. 
+  (aJ-s)Ali(S04)t  +  (y-2s)0IIH2n4.1.OH. 

By  the  formation  of  haloid  salts  or  sulphates  of  the  alcohol  radicals' 
together  with  unchanged  alcohol,  all  conditions  necessary  to  the  forma 
tion  of  ethers  are  given.     The  (vi'v  acid  (hereby  regenerated,  probably 
assisted  by  the  lowering  of  t he  temperature  at  the  end  of  the  reactionj 

converts  the  basic  salt  in  great  part  back  to  the  neutral  compounds. 
so  that  it  finally  appears  as  though  this  latter  had  remained  un- 
altered. 

These  reactions  had  been  considered  to  be  catalytic  processes  pre- 
viously to  the  correct  explanation  of  their  action  having  been  dlfl 
covered. 

203.  If  two  alcohols  are  allowed  to  read  simultaneously  on  the 
etherifying  agenj  (sulphuric  acid,  &&),  three  ethers  are  obtained,  two 
simple  and  one  mixed  ;  sulphates,  &c.,  of  the  two  different  alcohol 
radicals  being  formed,  of  which  each  reacts  on  each  of  the  two  alcohols, 
converting  them  into  ethers. 

These  ethers  are  also  obtained  when  .1  mixture  of  an  alcohol  and 

sulphuric;   acid  is  heated  to  the  teiiiperat  uro  of    ether  formation,  and  a 

second  alcohol  is  allowed  to  llow  in  continuously.  At  the  beginning  only

alcohol,  (CnH2n  +  1.OH),  to  form  the  ether,  (CnH2n+1)20,  which  is  at 
first  alone  formed.  If  now  the  second  alcohol,  (CmH2m+1.OH),  enters, 
it  will  form  its  acid  sulphate  with  the  still  unaltered  or  regenerated 
sulphuric  acid.  This,  reacting  on  the  first  alcohol,  yields  with  it 
the  ether,  (CnH2n+1)(CmH2m+1)0.  At  the  same  time  the  same 
ether  is  formed  by  the  action  of  the  already  formed  molecules  of 
CnH2n  +  1.HS04  on  the  second  alcohol.  In  time  the  quantity  formed 
of  this  second  ether  gradually  increases,  whilst  that  of  the  first  ether 
soon  diminishes.  Soon,  however,  molecules  of  CmH2m+  1#OH  come  in 
contact  with  those  of  CmH2m  +  1.HS04,  at  first  but  seldom,  later  with 
increasing  frequency.  The  second  simple  ether,  (CmH2m+1)20,  there- 
fore, begins  to  distil  over  in  rapidly  increasing  quantity,  forming  at 
length  the  sole  product ;  this  occurring  as  soon  as  the  first  alcohol 
has  completely  distilled  over  in  the  form  of  (CnH2n  +  1)20  and 
CnH2n  +  1.O.OmH2m+ 1. 

204.  Properties  and  Reactions. — The  ethers  are  mostly  liquids 
which  distil  unchanged,  are  either  entirely  insoluble  or  but  little 
soluble  in  water.  Their  boiling  points  are  invariably  lower  than 
those  of  the  metameric  alcohols.  By  reagents  they  are  generally 
more  difficultly  attacked  than  the  alcohols. 

By  water  at  high  temperatures  they  are  partly  converted  into 
alcohols ;  e.g. 

a(C2H5)20  +  &H20  =  2a£J2H5.OH  +  (a-a)(C2H5)20  +  (6-aj)H20. 

By  the  halogen  hydro-acids  they  are  converted,  on  heating,  into  the 
haloid  compounds  of  the  alcohol  radicals,  most  readily  by  hydriodie 
acid  : 

CnH2n  +  1.O.CmrI2m+1  +  2HI  =  CnH2n+1I  +  CmH2m+1I  +  H20, 

and  give  salts  with  strong  acids.  Treated  with  chlorine,  chlor-substi- 
tution  products  are  readily  obtained. 

By  oxidation,  especially  in  presence  of  water,  they  yield  essentially 
the  same  products  as  the  alcohols  from  which  they  are  derived,  the 
ethers  of  primary  alcohol  radicals  therefore  giving  aldehydes  and 
acids. 

205.  Methyl  ether,  or  dimethylic  oxide,  C2H60  =  CH3.O.CH3 
(metameric  with  ethylic  alcohol).  Methylic  ether  is  obtained  by  dis- 
tillation of  a  mixture  of  wood  spirit  with  four  times  its  weight  of  sul- 
phuric acid  ;  the  evolved  vapours  are  passed  through  potassic  hydrate 
solution,* and  the  unabsorbed  gas  condensed  in  vessels  cooled  by  a 
powerful  freezing  mixture. 

Methyl  ether  below  —21°  is  a  mobile  colourless  liquid,  at  ordinary 
temperatures  an  ethereal-smelling  gas,  of  density  1*6 17.  37  volumes 
of  it  are  absorbed  by  one  volume  of  water.  It  burns  with  a  strongly 
luminous  flame. 

206.  Ethyl-methyl  ether,  or  methylic  ethylic  oxide: 

C8H80  =  CH3.O.C2H5, 

is  prepared  from  sodic  methylate  and  ethylic  iodide,  or  better  from 
methylic  iodide  and  sodic  ethylate,  as  a  liquid  boiling  at  +  11°.  It  is 
also  formed,  together  with  dimethylic  oxide  and  ethyl  ether,  by  heat- 
ing a  mixture  of  ethylic  and  methylic  alcohols  with  sulphuric  acid.

207.  Ethyl  ether,  diethylic  oxide,  also  known  as  other  only, 
( ',11 10O  =  C.J !.,.<).< '  Jl  ,.     In  order  to  prep  m-  this  9  parts  of  strong 

sul[)huric  acid  and  5  parts  of  90  %  alcohol  are  distilled  at  1  1"  , 
under  constant  addition  of  more  alcohol,  until  the  amount  of  the 
latter  has  reached  about  live  time-;  the  weight  of  the  sulphuric  acid 
employed.  The  ethereal  layer  of  the  distillate,  after  repeated  agitation 
with  water,  is  dried  by  means  of  fused  calcic  chloride  and  then  dis- 
tilled. In  order  to  obtain  ether  completely  free  from  the  la  I 
traces  of  alcohol,  which  adhere  with  great  obstinacy,  it  mnsi 
allowed  to  stand  over  bright  pieces  of  sodium  until  all  evolution  of 
hydrogen  ceases. 

Pure  ether  is  a  very  mobile  colourless  Liquid  of  penetrating  odour, 
of  sp.  gr.  '736  at  0°,  boils  at  35°,  and  has  vaj>  mr  density  2*565.  It 
is  very  inflammable,  its  vapour  mixed  with  air  being  ignited  by  con- 
tact with  platinum  black,  and  burns  with  a  luminous  flame;  a  mix- 
ture of  its  vapour  and  air  is  violently  explosive. 

On  account  of  its  low  boiling  point,  ether  evaporat  s  very  quickly 
at  ordinary  temperatures,  and  causes  thereby  a  great  reduction  of 
temperature. 

It  mixes  in  every  proportion  with  absolute  alcohol,  but  not  witli 
water;  1  part  of  ether  requires  about  9  parts  of  water  for  solution, 
and  itself  dissolves  about  ,'j  of  its  weight  of  water.  On  shaking  a 
mixture  of  equal  volumes  of  water  and  ether,  and  then  allowing  to 
stand  quietly,  it  rapidly  separates  into  two  layers,  the  under  consist- 
ing of  a  solution  of  ether  in  water,  the  upper  of  water  dissolved  in 
ether.  Ethylic  ether  dissolves  about  -j^  of  its  weight  of  sulphur 
and  3^  of  phosphorus;  it  is  one  of  the  best  solvents  for  fats,  oils, 
resins,  and  other  organic  bodies,  and  dissolves  many  metallic  haloid 
salts,  such  as  auric  chloride,  platinic  chloride,  ferric  chloride,  mercuric 
chloride,  ivc. 

A  mixture  of  ethyl  ether  and  dry  bromine  solidifies  in  a  freezing 
mixture  to  a  red  crystalline  compound,  (C4H  l0O)»Br6j  which  is  readily 
decomposed  by  wat 

By  incomplete  oxidation  or  imperfect  combustion  it  is  com. 

into  aldehyde  and  acetic  acid.      With  hydrochloric  acid  it  yields 

ethylic  chloride.     It  is  not  attacked  by  potassium  or  sodium,  but  is 
very  energetically  by  chlorine,  which  causes  a  violent  explosion,  with

The  action  of  ethyl  ether  on  the  animal  organism  is  noteworthy. 
It  causes  intoxication,  or  if  breathed  as  vapour  in  large  quantity  it 
produces  loss  of  consciousness  and  sensation.  It  is  therefore  employed 
as  an  anaesthetic.

glittering  leaves,  which  melt  at  55°  and  distil  at  about  300°  with  slight

The  Ethereal  Salts  or  so-called  Compound  Ethers. 

210.  When  alcohols  and  strong  acids  are  mixed  together,  they 
react  with  elimination  of  water  and  formation  of  salts  of  the  alcohol 
radicals.  This  reaction,  even  when  assisted  by  heat,  is  invariably  only 
partial,  there  always  remaining  certain  quantities  of  unaltered  alcohol 
and  acid.  The  polybasic  acids  yield  principally  hydric  salts  corre- 
sponding to  their  hydric  (or  acid)  metallic  salts,  which  still  act  like 
acids,  replacing  their  acid  hydrogen  by  metals  when  added  to  metallic 
hydrates,  &c. 

A  method  of  preparation  frequently  employable  consists  in  heat- 
ing the  potassic  or  argentic  salt  of  the  acids  with  iodides  of  the  alcohol 

radicals;  e.g. 

a\g,PO<  +  30nHwlI«3AgI  +  (O.H^O.PO, . 

or  by  action  of  the  acid  chlorides  on   alcohols,  or   better  on  the  sodic 
alcoholates  : 

SOCl2  +  2Na().(\1II,MM  =  2NaCl  +  SO(<  .,),. 

All  these  compounds  are  partly  decomposed  into  alcohol  and  acid 
by  heating  with  water,  and  are  readily  and  completely  decomposed  by 
heating  with  solution  of  strong  basic  hydrates,  a  metallic  salt  being 
formed  and  the  alcohol  liberated.  The  process  is  known  as  taponifi* 
cation. 

In  the  following  only  the  salts  of  the  inorganic  acids,  of  the 
cyanogen  acids,  and  of  carbonic  acid  will  be  given,  those  of  the  organic 
acids  being  mentioned  Inter. 


150       DERIVATIVES   OF  THE    ALCOHOL  RADICALS,   CnHo„+1. 

Nitrates  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals,  CnH2n+1.O.N02. 

211.  The  nitrates  of  the  alcohol  radicals  result  from  the  action  of 
strong  nitric  acid  on  the  alcohols ;  but  the  alcohols  are  easily  con- 
verted into  oxidation  products,  and  nitric  acid  readily  parts  with 
oxygen,  and  is  reduced  to  nitrous  acid,  so  that  by  heating  the  main  pro- 
ducts of  the  reaction  are  aldehydes,  organic  acids,  and  nitrites  of  the 
alcohol  radicals.  In  order  to  prevent  the  formation  of  these,  the  re- 
action must  be  so  managed  either  that  the  oxidising  action  of  the 
nitric  acid  cannot  occur,  or  that  the  nitrous  acid  shall  be  destroyed 
before  it  can  act  on  the  alcohols. 

1.  The  first  problem  may  be  accomplished  by  mixing  the  alcohol 
and  acid  in  a  platinum  basin  cooled  by  a  freezing  mixture  to  —18° 
to  —  20°,  both  alcohol  and  acid  having  been  previously  cooled  to  con- 
siderably below  0°. 

2.  In  order  to  destroy  any  nitrous  acid  that  may  be  formed,  urea 
is  added  to  the  acid  before  addition  of  the  alcohol ;  as  previously 
mentioned  (§  136),  this  reduces  nitrous  acid  very  readily  according 
to  the  equation  : 

CO.(NH2)2  +  2HN02  =  C02  +  3H20  +  2N2. 

If  the  nitric  acid  was  pretty  free  from  trioxide  or  tetroxide  of 
nitrogen  at  starting,  a  relatively  small  quantity  of  urea  completely 
answers  this  purpose. 

The  nitrates  of  the  alcohol  radicals  decompose  on  heating  to  high 
temperatures,  mostly  with  explosion,  consequent  on  the  partial  oxida 
tion  of  the  carbo-hydrogen  radical  by  the  oxygen  of  the  acid  group. 
They  are  easily  saponified  by  heating  with  alkalies  : 

CnH2n+1.O.N02  +  KOH  =  KO.N02  +  CnH2n+1.OH. 

212.  The  following  are  the  best  known  : — 

Methylic  nitrate,  CH3.ON02,  is  a  colourless,  heavy  liquid,  little 
soluble  in  water,  which  boils  at  66°  and  whose  vapour  detonates  at 
150°. 

Ethylic  nitrate,  C2H5O.N02,  is  obtained  by  distillation  of  60  grams 
of  alcohol  with  the  same  weight  of  nitric  acid  of  sp.  gr.  1*4,  one 
gram  of  urea  being  also  added.  It  is  not  advisable  to  prepare  larger 
quantities,  on  account  of  the  danger  of  an  explosion.  At  first  aqueous 
alcohol  distils  over,  later  the  ethylic  nitrate.  It  is  a  colourless,  agree- 
able-smelling liquid,  of  sp.  gr.  1*112  at  17°,  which  boils  at  85°,  and 
whose  vapour  on  over-heating  decomposes  with  explosion.  It  is 
nearly  insoluble  in  water. 

Isobutylic  nitrate,  (CH3)2CH.CH2.O.N02,  is  obtained  by  action  of 
argentic  nitrate  on  isobutylic  iodide,  as  a  liquid  boiling  at  123°  and 
ofsp,  gr.  1038  at  0°: 

C4H9I  +  Ag.O.N02  =  Agl  +  C4H9.O.N02. 

Isoamylic  nitrate,  {CH3)2CH.CH2.CH2.O.ISr02;  is  a  colourless  oil, 
boiling  at  148°,  which,  from"  7°  to  8°,"has  the  sp.  gr.  1*000;  at  lower 
temperatures  is  heavier,  at  higher  temperatures  lighter,  than  water  of 
like  temperature. 


NITRITES.      8ULPHAT28.  151 

Nitrites  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals,  <!I,H..I1.M.O.NO. 

213.  The  true  nitrites  of  the  alcohol  radioalfl  are  prepared  in  the 

impure  condition  by  the  action  of  nitric  acid  upon  the  alcohols  (§  211) ; 
in  greater  purity  by  [Kissing  the  vapour  of  nitrous  anhydride  into  the 
cooled  alcohol  : 

2<  'uH,n  ,  t.OH  +  N203  =  2CnII2n+1.O.NO  +  II20, 

or  by  distillation  of  the  alcohol  with  potassic:  nitrite  and  sulphuric 
acid. 

They  are  more  readily  volatile  than  the  corresponding  nitrates, 
and  are  in  part  employed  in  medicine.  Mixed  with  potassic  hydrate, 
they  yield  alcohol  and  potassic  nitrite.  After  a  tame,  especially  if 
exposed  to  light,  they  spontaneously  decompose  with  formation  of 
oxidation  products  of  the  alcohol  radical  and  nitrogen  gas. 

The  nitro-ethanes,  ((nll2n+  i-N02  (§  289),  are  isomeric  with  these 
bodies. 

Methylic  nitrite,  CH3.O.NO,  is,  at  ordinary  temperatures,  a  mo- 
bile gas  of  agreeable  odour,  condensable  by  cold  to  a  colourless  liquid, 
which  boils  at  -12°. 

Ethylic  nitrite,  C2H3.O.NO,  boils  at  +16°,  and  has  below  this 
temperature  sp.  gr.  "947.  It  is  insoluble  in  water.  '  Sweet  spirits 
of  nitre  '  is  a  mixture  of  ethylic  nitrite  with  ethylic  alcohol  and  oxi- 
dation products  of  the  latter,  especially  aldehyde  and  ethylic  acetate. 
In  order  to  prepare  it  eight  parts  of  strong  alcohol  are  mixed  with 
one  part  of  fuming  nitric  acid,  and,  after  standing  twenty-four  hours, 
distilled ;  the  distillate  is  shaken  with  potassic  carbonate  in  order  to 
remove  any  free  acid,  and  then  again  rectified. 

Isoamylic  nitrite,  (CH3)2CH.CH2.CH2.O.NO,  is  a  liquid  boiling  at 
96°,  whose  vapour,  when  inhaled,  produces  violent  headache. 

Alkylic  Sulphates. 

214.  As  sulphuric  acid  forms  with  monovalent  metals  acid  and 
neutral  salts,  so  similarly  it  yields  with  the  alcohol  radicals  acid  and 
neutral  sulphates.  The  acid  sulphates  behave  as  monobasic  acids, 
exchanging  the  hydroxylic  hydrogen  for  metals,  and  so  forming 
neutral  salts  :

one  another  (§  "201).  To  obtain  the  product,  the  cooled  and  diluted 
mixture  is  neutralised  with  the  carbonate  of  one  of  those  metals  which 
yield  insoluble  sulphates — barium,  strontium,  or  lead.  In  this  way  the 
sulphuric  acid,  remaining  unchanged  according  to  the  equation  : 

*OnH,n+1.OH  +  2/H2S04  =*CnH2n+1.HS04  +  *H,0 
+  (*-*)CnH2n+1.OH  +  (y-*)HaS04, 

is  removed  from  the  solution,  whilst  the  alkylic  metallic  sulphate 
remains  dissolved.  This  can  be  purified  by  recrystallisation,  and  from 
its  solution,  by  precipitation  of  the  metal,  an  aqueous  solution  of  the 
acid  alkylic  sulphate  obtained  :

By  evaporation  in  vacuo  at  ordinary  temperatures  the  solution 
can  be  concentrated,  and  the  acid  sulphates  obtained  generally  as 
strongly  acid  syrupy  liquids. 

By  long  standing  in  aqueous  solution  the  reciprocal  process  to 
that  of  their  formation,  decomposition  into  alcohol  and  free  acid, 
slowly  ensues  ;  on  boiling  this  residts  in  shorter  time,  and  the  alcohol 
distils  over  : 

CnH^-f  i-HSG4  +  H,0  +  xKfi  =  CnH2n+  !.OH  +  H2S04  +  *H2. 

This  is  a  reaction  exactly  analogous  to  that  already  given  (§  201) 
as  that  of  an  alcohol  at  high  temperature : 

^uH.2n  +  1.Hk504  +  C1mH2m+ 1# OH  =  CnH2n+  1.O.CmH2m+ 1  +  H2S04. 

On  heating  the  pure  acid  sulphates  by  themselves,  sulphuric  acid  is 
regenerated,  and  by  removal  of  hydrogen  an  olefine  formed  : 

CnH2n  +  1.H.S04  =  H2S04  +  CnH2n. 

The  metallic  salts  of  these  bodies  behave  similarly.  On  boiling 
with  water  they  decompose  slowly  into  acid  metallic  sulphates  and 
alcohol  : 

C„H.ni+1.M.S04  +  H00  +  a-H,0  =  HMS04  +  CnH,n+1.OH 

+  xH20 ; 

and  this  decomposition  occurs  especially  readily  if  the  solution  con- 
tains free  acid.  It  is  therefore  necessary  in  evaporating  solutions  of 
these  salts  to  have  a  little  carbonate  or  metallic  hydrate  present.  A 
larger  quantity  of  the  latter  in  concentrated  solution,  on  the  other 
hand,  completely  decomposes  the  compound  : 

CnH.2U+1.KS04  +  KOH  =  K2S04  +  CnH2n+1.OH. 

By  dry  distillation  the  metallic  alkylic  sulphates  yield  chiefly  acid 
metallic  salts  and  defines ': 

CnH2n+1.KS04  =*=  HKS04  +  CnH,n,

By  dissolving  this  salt  in  water,  precipitating  the  barium  by  the 
requisite  amount  of  sulphuric  acid,  and  evaporating  the  liquid  in

amylic  alcohol.  From  them  the  respective  modifications  of  the  alcohols 
can  be  prepared  by  distillation  with  water  (§  170,  4  and  7). 

The  Neutral  Alkylic  Sulphates. 

217.  The  only  neutral  sulphate  that  can  be  prepared  in  the  pure 
state  by  heating  the  alcohol  with  sulphuric  acid  is 
Dimethylic  sulphate,  (CH3)2S04 : 

2CH3.OH  +  H2S04  =  (CH3)2S04  +  H20. 

For  this  purpose  one  part  of  methylic  alcohol  is  distilled  with  eight  to 
ten  parts  of  strong  sulphuric  acid,  and  the  portion  distilling  at  150° 
collected  separately.  This  is  then  washed  with  water,  the  oil  remain- 
ing undissolved,  dried  by  calcic  chloride  and  repeatedly  rectified.  The 
boilii)g  point  of  the  pure  sulphate  is  188°,  the  sp.  gr.  =  1"234.  It  has 
a  garlic  odour,  is  not  soluble  in  water,  but  is  slowly  decomposed  by  it 
into  methylic  alcohol  and  hydric  methylic  sulphate  : 

(CH3)2S04  +  H20  =  CH3.OH  +  CH3.H.S04. 

Distilled  with  sodic  chloride,  it  yields  methylic  chloride  : 

(CH3)2S04  +  2NaCl:=  2CH3.C1  +  Na2S04. 

Diethylic  sulphate  is  formed  by  the  action  of  sulphuric  anhydride 
upon  ethylic  alcohol  or  ether,  together  with  isethionic  acid  and  ise- 
thionic  anhydride.  It  is  generally  prepared  by  passing  the  vapour 
of  sulphuric  anhydride  into  anhydrous  ether,  cooled  by  a  freezing 
mixture  : 

(C2H5)20  +  S03  =  (C2H5)2S04. 

The  resultant  syrupy  liquid  is  diluted  with  water,  and  shaken  with 
ethylic  ether,  by  which  the  sulphate  is  dissolved.  The  ethereal 
layer  is  then  separated  from  the  lower  aqueous  acid  solution,  and 
evaporated  in  vacuo.  Diethylic  sulphate  remains  as  an  oily  liquid 
of  peppermint  odour,  sp.  gr.  1*12.  By  heating  it  decomposes  with 
formation  of  ethylene,  and  therefore  cannot  be  obtained  by  distillation. 
Heated  with  water  it  yields  ethylic  alcohol  and  the  acid  sulphate. 

Sulphites  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals. 

218.  Of  the  alkylic  salts  of  sulphurous  acid,  SO(OH)2,  only  the 
normal  salts  are  known.  They  are  prepared  by  action  of  thionyl 
dichloride  on  the  alcohols  :

together  with  the  alkylic  chlorides.  They  are  formed  in  more  com- 
plicated reaction  by  mixing  alcohols  with  chloride  of  sulphur,  together 
with  sulpho-alcohols  (mercaptans),  alcoholic  chlorides,  separation  of 
sulphur,  hydrochloric  acid,  &c. ;  e.g. 

S2C12  +  3C2H5.OH  =  SO(OC2H5)2  +  C2H5.SH  +  2HC1.

They  are  separated  from  the  mixed  products  by  fractional  distillation.

In  every  case  the  crude  product  is  diluted  with  water  and  neu-

Diethylic  phosphate,  C0H5.0-^PO.     By  evaporation  in  a  vacuum 
HCK 

it  remains  as  a  strongly  acid  syrup,  which  yields  in  most  cases  readily 
soluble  and  crvstallisable  salts  with  metallic  oxides  or  carbonates. 

The  lead  salt  of  monethylic  phosphate,  being  insoluble,  is  found  in 
the  residue.  If  this  be  suspended  in  water,  and  hydric  sulphide 
passed  through  the  liquid,  phosphoric  acid  and  monethylic  phosphate  go 
into  solution  ;  after  filtration  the  liquid  is  more  than  neutralised  with 
baric  carbonate,  and  the  insoluble  baric  phosphate  filtered  off.  On 
evaporation  of  the  filtrate  baric  ethylic  phosphate,  C2H5.Ba.P04,6H20, 
crystallises  in  colourless  six-sided  prisms,  from  which,  by  addition  of 
(.he  requisite  quantity  of  sulphuric  acid,  monethylic  phosphate  is  set 
free,  and  can  be  obtained  by  evaporation  of  the  filtered  liquid  as  a 
strongly  acid  syrup.  On  heating,  alcohol,  ethylic  ether,  and  later  ethy- 
lene, are  evolved,  and  a  residue  of  metaphosphoric  acid  and  carbon  is 
left. 

Triethylic  phosphate,  (C2H5)3P04,  is  formed,  together  with  a  salt  of 
monethylic  phosphate,  by  the  dry  distillation  of  a  salt  of  diethylic 
phosphate;  e.g. 

Pb(C2H,)4P208  =  (C,H5)3P01  +  Pb.(G\,H5)PO, ; 

also  by  action  of  phosphoric  anhydride  on  pure  ethylic  ether  : 

P205  +  3(C2H5)20  =  L>(C2H5)3P04 ; 

and  by  addition  of  phosphoric  oxychloride  to  an  alcoholic  solution  of 
sodic  ethylate : 

P0C13  +  3NaOC2H5  =  3NaCl  +  PO(C2H5.0)3. 

Triethylic  phosphate  is  a  colourless  neutral  liquid,  boiling  at  215°, 
soluble  in  water,  alcohol,  and  ether,  and  after  a  short  time  decom- 
posed by  the  first  into  alcohol  and  diethylic  phosphate.

222.  If  in  the  action  of  PC13  on  alcohol  the  former  be  in  excess,

223.  Arsenic  and  arsenious  acids  yield  compounds  which  generally 
correspond  to  those  of  the  phosphorous  acids.  The  normal  salts  are 
most  readily  prepared  by  action  of  alkylic  iodides  upon  the  argentic 
salts  j  e.g. 

AsO(OAg)3  +  3IC2H5  =  3AgI  +  AsO(C2H50)3. 

Triethylic  arseniate  can  be  distilled  unchanged  under  reduced 
pressure. 

The  normal  arsenites  are  best  prepared  from  arsenious  tribromides 
and  the  sodic  alkylate.  Trimethylic  arsenite,  As(O.CH3)3,  boils  at 
120°;  triethylic  arsenite,  As(OC2H5)3,  at  166°-168°.  Both  are  at 
once  decomposed  by  water  : 

2As(O.C2H5)3  +  3H20  =  As203  +  6C2H5.OH. 

Alkylic  Borates. 

224.  The  ortho-borates,  corresponding  to  B(OH)3,  are  obtained 
without  difficulty  by  passing  boron  trichloride  into  the  alcohols,  or  by 
heating  the  latter  with  boric  anhydride.  At  the  same  time  the  salts 
of  metaboric  acid,  BO. OH,  are  invariably  formed.  On  distilling  the 
mixture  the  trialkylic  borates  and  unchanged  alcohols  pass  over, 
whilst  the  metaborate  remains  behind.  Also  by  heating  crystallised 
boric  acid  with  alcohol  small  quantities  of  these  compounds  are 
formed,  which,  evaporating  with  the  alcohol,  impart  their  character- 
istic green  coloration  to  its  flame. 

The  alkylic  ortho-borates  are  colourless  liquids. 

Trimethylic  borate.  B(O.CH3)3,  boils  at  65°. 

Triethylic  borate,  B(O.C2H5)3,  boils  at  120°,  and  has  sp  gr.  '887. 

Tri-isoamylic  borate,  B(O.C5Hu)3,  boils  at  255°. 

On  heating  these  with  boric  anhydride  they  yield  metaborates  : 

B(O.CnH2n+1)3  +  B203  ==  3BO(O.CnH,n+1), 

which  are  all  syrupy  liquids.  On  distillation  they  split  up  into  the 
volatile  ortho-borates,  and  a  residue,  glacial  on  cooling,  of  a  salt  of 
monobasic  triboric  acid  : 

4BO(O.CnH2n+1)  =  B(O.CnH2n+1)3  +  B304(O.CnH2ntl).

The  known  compounds  are  distillable  liquids,  insoluble  in  water,  by 

which  they  are  slowly  decomposed  into  alcohols  and  glacial  hydratcd

it  acts  only  as  a  dibasic  acid,  but  with  the  alcohol  radicals  also  as  a 
tetrabasic  acid.  It  has,  therefore,  considerable  analogy  with  silicic 
acid.

Solutions  of  the  alkalies  and  of  baric  hydrate  in  absolute  alcohol 
always  contain  some  quantities  of  the  respective  metallic  alky! 
(§  198)  ;  on  addition  of  dry  carbonic  anhydride,  therefore,  there  is 
formed,  in  addition  to  a  precipitate  of  metallic  carbonate,  also  a 
metallic  alkylic  carbonate,  which  being  somewhat  soluble  in  alcohol, 
can  be  separated  from  the  metallic  carbonate  and  obtained  in  the 
crystalline  condition  by  addition  of  ethylic  ether  to  the  solution. 

The  metallic  alkylic  carbonates  mostly  form  scaly  crystals  of 
silky  lustre,  which  are  soluble  in  water  and  are  decomposed  thereby,

By  dry  distillation  with  metallic  alkylic  Bulphates,  or  by  heating

This  process  can  only  be  conducted  with  the  higher  boiling  alcohols  in

the  amylic  alcohols.  By  employing  nitrate  of  urea  instead  of  urea

As  they  are  more  difficultly  soluble  in  water  than  the  carbamates 
formed  at  the  same  time  (§  231),  they  can  be  readily  separated  from 
the  latter. 

On  submitting  alkylic  allophanates  to  dry  distillation,  they 
evolve  alcohols,  and  leave  a  residue  of  cyanuric  acid,  which  on  fur- 
ther heating  is  resolved  into  cyanic  acid  : 

3NH2.CO.NH.CO.O.CnH2n  +  1  =  3HO.CnH2n+l  +  2C,08K8H8. 

On  heating  them  in  closed  tubes  at  100°  with  alcoholic  ammonia, 
they  yield  biuret  : 

NH2.CO.NH.CO.O.CnH2n+1  +  NH3  =  NH2.CO.NH.CO.NH2 
+  HO.CnH2n  +  1. 

233.  Methyl  ic,  ethylic,  and  isoamylic  allophanates  have  been  pre- 
pared ;  the  two  first  crystallise  in  needles,  the  last  in  nacreous  plates 
melting  at  1 62°. 

If  the  alkylic  allophanates  are  rubbed  together  with  baric  hy- 
drate in  the  cold,  baric  allophanate  is  formed,  together  with  alcohol : 

2(C2H5.O.CO.NH.CO.NH2)  +  Ba(OH)2  =  Ba(O.CO.NH.CO.NH2)2 

+  2C2H5.OH. 

Baric  allophanate,  however,  is  very  readily  decomposed,  and  allo- 
phanic  acid  cannot  be  obtained  by  addition  of  strong  acids,  as  it  splits 
up  into  carbonic  anhydride  and  urea  :

235.  During  their  formation  even,   the   alkylic    cyanates    partly

sulphides  containing  dyad  sulphur  show  very  complete  analogy  to  the 
oxygen  compounds  of  corresponding  composition. 

The  mercaptans,  or  thio-alcohols,  CnH2n+1.SH,  correspond  to  the 
alcohols;  the  thio-ethers,  or  alcoholic  sulphides,  (CnH2n  +  1)2S,  to  the 
ethers.  In  many  cases  the  sulphur  developes  its  higher  valency, 
forming  bodies  without  analogy  among  the  mineral  compounds  of 
sulphur. 

Mercaptans,  or  Thio-alcohols,  CnH2n+1.SH. 

237.  The  alkylic  sulphhydrates,  or  thio-alcohols,  can  be  prepared 
from  many  of  the  derivatives  of  the  alcohol  radicals  already  men- 
tioned. 

The  alcohols  are  partly  converted  into  the  mercaptans  when 
heated  with  phosphoric  pentasulphide.  In  a  similar  manner  to  its 
decomposition  by  water  into  phosphoric  acid  and  hydric  sulphide,  it 
gives,  in  part,  with  alcohols,  phosphoric  acid  and  thio-alcohols. 

The  phosphoric  acid  is,  at  the  same  time,  in  considerable  part 
converted  into  its  alkylic  salts,  so  that  the  main  reaction  may  be 
represented  by  the  equation  : 

P2S5  +  8(OJI2n+1.OH)  =  (CnH2n+1)2HP04  +  (CnH2n+1)H2P04 
-f-  5CnH2n  +  i-SH. 

But  as  phosphoric  pentasulphide  behaves  to  the  thio-alcohols  similarly 
to  P205  on  the  alcohols,  alcoholic  thio-phosphates  are  also  formed. 

From  the  haloid  compounds  of  the  alcohol  radicals  the  mercaptans 
can  be  produced  by  heating  with  alcoholic  solution  of  potassic  sulph- 
hydrate  : 

CnH2n  +  1Cl  +  KSH  =  CnH2n+1.SH  +  KC1. 

A  portion  of  the  mercaptan  first  formed  reacts  on  some  still  unchanged 
potassic  sulphhydrate,  forming  the  potassic  thio-alkylate  (compare 
§197): 

CnH2n+  1-SH  +  KSH  ■=  SH2  +  CnH2n  +  j.S.K  ; 

which  in  its  turn  reacting  on  the  alkylic  haloid  compound,  gives 
rise  to  the  formation  of  thio-ethers  : 

CnH2n+1.SK  +  CaH2n+iCl  —  (CnH2n+1)2S  +  KC1. 

It  is  therefore  generally  preferable  to  submit  a  mixture  of  an 
alkylic  potassic  sulphate  with  potassic  sulphhydrate  to  distillation  : 

(CnH2n+1)KS04  +  KSH  =  K2S04  +  CnH2n  +  1.SH. 

238.  The  thio-alcohols  are  mostly  liquids  of  most  unpleasant  garlic 
odour,  which  distil  without  decomposition  and  are  nearly  insoluble 
in  water.  Their  sulphhydroxylic  hydrogen  atom  is  more  easily  re- 
placed by  metals  than  the  hydroxy  lie  hydrogen  of  alcohols,  being  not 
merely  the  case  only  by  the  alkalies,  but  also  with  equal  or  greater 
ease  by  those  heavy  metals  which  are  precipitated  from  acid  solutions 
by  hydric  sulphide.  This  reaction  occurs  with  especial  ease  with 
mercury.  On  shaking  an  alcoholic  solution  of  a  thio-alcohol  with 
mercuric  oxide,  a  crystalline  mercuric  thio-alcoholate  is  formed,  with 
considerable  evolution  of  heat : 

2CnH2n  +  ^SH  +  HgO  =  H00  +  pn52n  +  1|>Hg;

From  these  reactions  the  thio-alcohols  have  got  the  name  mercap- 
tans  (from  merourUHtptwn)  j  the  metallic  derivatives  are  frequently 
termed  mercaptides. 

All  oxidating  bodies  read   very  readily  on  the  mercaptans,  the 

more  energetic,  such  as  concentrated  nitric  acid,  often  with  great  vio- 
lence.    By  such   oxidation  the  sulphur  is  not  separated   from   the 

carbon,  but  l>y  taking  up  tin  d  is  converted  into  the 

group   SOj.OH,    which,    tmited    to   the   alcohol    radical,  forms    a   sul-

Ethylic  mercaptan,  or  ethylic  thio-alcohol,  C2H5.SH,  is  a  colourless

So  far  as  known  they  are  colourless  liquids  of  most  unpleasant 
odour,  miscible  with  alcohol  and  ether,  but  not  with  water,  and  which 
readily  take  up  two  atoms  of  oxygen  from  oxidising  agents.  With 
metallic  salts,  especially  those  of  mercury,  they  yield  solid  compounds, 
as  also  with  the  iodides  of  the  alcohol  radicals.  They  also  unite 
directly  with  two  atoms  of  the  halogens.

These  hydrates  are  difficultly  crystallisable  bodies  of  strongly  alkaline 
properties,  which  deliquesce  in  damp  air.  They  absorb  gaseous  car- 
bonic anhydride,  and  when  mixed  with  metallic  salts  unite  with  the 
acid,  precipitating  the  metal  as  hydrate.  On  warming  with  amnionic 
salts  they  expel  the  ammonia ;  e.g. 

NH4C1  +  S(C2II,)3.OH  =  S(C2H5)3C1  +  H20  4-  NH3.

Methyl  sulphonic  acid  is  a  strongly  acid  syrupy  liquid,  which  on

178      DERIVATIVES   OF   THE   ALCOHOL  RADICALS,   CnH2n+1. 


Nitrogen  Compounds  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals. 

258.  The  most  numerous  class  of  nitrogen  compounds  of  the 
alcohols  correspond  to  ammonia  and  its  derivations  in  structure  and 
in  properties;  in  addition  the  group  of  compounds  of  N02  with 
the  alcohol  radicals,  the  nitro-ethanes  have  been  lately  added. 

Alkylamines. 

259.  The  simplest  nitrogen  compounds  of  the  first  group  are  the 
alkylamines,  i.e.  ammonia  in  which  one,  two,  or  all  three  hydrogen 
atoms  have  been  replaced  by  the  same  number  of  alcohol  radicals. 
They  may  be  classified  into  :

(tertiary  amines). 


As  the  alcohol  radicals  replacing  the  hydrogen  in  the  secondary 
and  tertiary  amines  may  be  either  alike  or  different,  the  number  of 
bodies  of  this  kind  that  can  be  prepared  is  very  great. 

260.  Formation  from  Alcoholic  Haloids  and  Ammonia. — On 
bringing  ammonia  together  with  alkylic  haloid,  best  in  alcoholic 
solution  and  at  a  high  temperature,  direct  union  occurs.  Similarly 
to  the  formation  of  ammonic  chloride  from  hydrochloric  acid  and 
ammonia,  there  is  formed  by  this  reaction — but  not  with  the  same 
ease  and  energy — mon-alkylammonium  haloid  :

or  NH3  +  CnH2n  +  1Cl  =  N(CnH2n+1)H3Cl. 

Every  ammonic  salt,  as  is  well  known,  is  decomposed  by  alkalies 
into  alkaline  salt,  water,  and  ammonia,  the  hydroxyl  group  of  the 
metallic  hydrate  oxidising  and  removing  one  of  the  four  hydrogen 
atoms  from  the  nitrogen  compound.  Alkalies  act  in  entirely  similar 
manner  on  the  hydrogen  of  the  salts  of  the  amines.     If,  therefore,  the

These  processes  are,  however,  not  so  simpta  as  above  roptoumted  ; 

even  in  the  first  reaction  between  ammonia  and  the  alkylio  haloid 
complications  occur  which  render  the  obtaining  of  pure  products 
extremely  difficult.

of  it  reacts  with  the  other  substances  present,  so  as  to  lead  to  s  real 
substituting  reaction,  with  formation  of  some  dialkylammonk  sail  : 

N(0aHMI+l)Hs01  +  0pHtll+l.a+  NH,  =  Nll4cl 
+  N< 

and  this  latter  is  then,  though  only  partly,  converted  Intoaterl 
amnionic  chloride  by  a  similar  reaction  : 


180        DERIVATIVES   OF   THE   ALCOHOL   RADICALS,   CnH,n+1. 

N(CnH2n+1)2H2OI  +  CnH2n+1Cl  +  NH3  =  NH4C1 
+  N(CnH2n+1)3HCl; 

If,  therefore,  the  alkylic  haloid  has  been  completely  decomposed 
by  excess  of  ammonia,  the  product  is  a  mixture  of  mono-,  di-,  tri-,  and 
tetra-alkylamnionium  salts,  from  which,  by  distillation  with  potassic 
hydrate,  a  mixture  of  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary  amines  is 
obtained. 

261.  Method  of  Preparation. — As  iodine  is  attached  with  least 
energy  to  the  carbon  of  alcohol  radicals,  the  alkylic  iodides  are 
nearly  always  used  for  preparing  the  amines.  The  alkylic  iodide  is 
heated  to  boiling  with  several  times  its  volume  of  alcohol  in  a  flask 
provided  with  an  inverted  Liebig's  condenser,  and  dry  ammonia  con- 
tinually passed  in.  The  vapours  rising  into  the  condenser  are  thus 
caused  to  now  back  into  the  flask.  So  soon  as  a  portion  of  the  liquid 
remains  clear  on  addition  of  water,  all  the  alkylic  iodide  has  been 
converted.  By  distilling  off  the  alcohol  a  dry  mixture  is  obtained  of 
some  amnionic  iodide  with  the  iodides  of  the  respective  amines,  the 
primary  compound  predominating.  This  is  dissolved  in  water  and 
distilled  with  potassic  hydrate. 

If  the  bromides  or  chlorides  of  the  alcohol  radicals  be  employed 
instead  of  the  iodides,  a  higher  temperature  is  required  to  complete 
the  reaction  ;  they  are  therefore  heated  to  100°  with  excess  of  alcoholic 
solution  of  ammonia,  either  in  sealed  tubes  or,  if  working  with  large 
quantities,  in  Papin's  digesters.  In  the  case  of  the  chlorides  the 
amnionic  chloride  is  found  separated  mostly  in  the  crystalline  state, 
whilst  the  chlorides  of  the  amines  remain  dissolved  in  the  alcohol, 
and  by  evaporation  are  left  nearly  free  from  amnionic  salts.  They 
therefore  yield,  on  addition  of  strong  solution  of  sodic  hydrate,  a  mix- 
ture of  the  three  bases  free  from  ammonia,  which  on  standing  in 
closed  vessels  collects  as  a  lighter  layer  on  the  top  of  the  concentrated 
solution  of  sodic  chloride. 

262.  The  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary  amines  of  low  carbon 
contents  cannot  be  satisfactorily  separated  from  one  another  by  frac- 
tional distillation.  The  following  method  is  therefore  employed  for 
their  separation  :  The  mixture  is  dried  by  means  of  solid  sodic 
hydrate,  and  then  mixed  with  normal  ethylic  oxalate.  This  method 
answers  especially  well  for  the  separation  of  the  ethylamines,  and 
they  will  be  taken  as  an  example.  Monethylamine  reacts  with 
ethylic  oxalate  according  to  the  equation  :

2N(C2H3)H2+    |  =2HO.C2H5+    | 

<JO.O.C2H5  CO.N(C2H5)H 

forming  alcohol  and  crystalline  diethyl  oxamide,  which  is  soluble  in 
water ;  diethylamine,  on  the  other  hand,  yielding  the  liquid  ethylic 
diethyl  oxamate,  which  boils  at  250°-254°  :

and  triethylamine  remaining  entirely  unaltered.     On  distillation  the

latter  passes  over  first.     The  diethyl   oxamide  and  ethylk  diethyl 
oxamate  are  then  separated  by  means  erf  warm  water,  and  each 
tilled  separately  with  potaasio hydrate.     The  first  yields  ethylamine:

263.  Other  Methods  of  Formation.  The  nitrates  <»f  the  amines 
are  formed  by  heating  alcoholic  ammonia  with  the  nitrates  of  the 
alcohol  radicals  : 

0,H8.O,NO,  +  NH3  =  N(G\2H5)H3.O.N02. 

The  process,  however,  also  goes  further  in  this  c 

C2H5.O.N02  +  NH3  +  N(C2H,)H3.O.N02  =  NH4.O.N02 
+  N(C,H,)2H2.O.N02,  (fee. 

so  that  the  same  difficulty  occurs  here  in  obtaining  pure  products. 

Some  of  these  bodies  occur  naturally  or  result  from  the  spon- 
taneous decomposition,  or  from  the  dry  distillation,  of  albuminous 
matters.  Special  methods  of  preparation  will  be  given  at  the  re- 
spective places. 

264.  General  Properties  of  the  Amines. — These  bodies  behave  in 
all  essential  particulars  like  ammonia.  The  volatile  possess  an  odour 
similar  to  that  of  ammonia,  and  give  thick  fumes  with  hydrochloric 
acid.  Their  aqueous  solutions  react  strongly  alkaline;  they  yield 
salts  with  acids  without  elimination  of  water,  neutral  in  th< 
monobasic,  both  acid  and  neutral  in  the  case  ofpolybasic  acid-  : 

N(CnH2n+1)xH3_x  +  H.,S(),  =  (<  '..H.,,,^  ,)XH  ,   x.()x  g 

and 

2N(OnH2n  +  1)xH3^  +  II,S()1  =  [N,('i11I,Mt1,JI1   x],SO,. 

They  are,  generally  speaking,  soluble  in  alcohol,  and  arc  thereby 
distinguished  from  the  amnionic  salts,  which  are  mostly  insoluble. 
The  hydrochloric  compounds  combine  with  platinic  chloride  to  yellow 
double  salts  of  the  formula  : 

[N(('„H.ill+,)JI,   J,l't<'l,, 
similar  to  amnionic  platinic  chloride.     These  latter  compoundi 
crystalline  and  somewhat  soluble  in  warm  water  and  alcohol. 

All  amines,  when  in  the  state  of  vapour,  burn  in  air  with  ■  con 
tinuous  flame,  whilst  ammonia  can  only  be  got  to  burn  continuously 
in  pure  oxygen.

265.  Metamerism  of  the  Amines. — All  alcoholic  amines  may  be 
expressed  by  the  general  formula  NCnH2n  +  3. 

N(CnH2n+1)H2  =  NCnH2n  +  3 

N(Cn,H2n.+  02H  =  NC2nH4n.+  2  + ,  =  NCnH2n  +  3  (if  2n.  =  n). 

N(Cn.H2n.+  I)(Cn.Han»+1)H  =  NCn.+n.H2n>+2n.+  2+1  =  NCnH2n+1 

y*    n'  +  n"==n/ 

N(CVH2n-+  {)3  =  NC3n.H2.3n.+  3  =  NCnH2n  +  3  (if  3n.  =  n). 
N(Cn»H2n#+i)(Cn«H2n«+  i)(Cn-H2nW+  t) 

=  NCn'  +  n"  +  n"'tl2(n'  +  n"  +  n-)  +  3  =  iNLnrl2n  +  3  (if  n' +  n"  +  n"  =  n)« 

It  follows  from  this  that  very  numerous  cases  of  metamerism  must 
occur  in  this  group,  being  increased  by  cases  of  true  isomerism  in  the 
alcohol  radicals  concerned. 

Whilst  the  formula  NCH5  corresponds  to  only  one  body,  methyl- 
amine,  N(CH3)H2,  the  formula  NC2H7  belongs  to  two  different 
bodies,  etnylamine,  N(C2H5)H2,  and  dimethyl  amine,  N(CH3)2H. 
The  number  of  metamers  and  isomers  increases  with  every  additional 
carbon  atom.     Four  bodies  NC3H9  exist :

and  so  forth  in  rapidly  increasing  progression. 

The  discrimination  of  the  individual  metameric  and  isomeric 
compounds  presents  considerable  difficulties.  It  can  be  easily  deter- 
mined whether  an  amine  of  a  given  formula  is  a  primary,  secondary, 
or  tertiary  body,  but  bodies  of  the  same  degree  of  substitution  cannot 
generally  be  well  distinguished  from  one  another. 

The  tertiary  amines  are  characterised  by  the  fact  that  their  com- 
pounds with  alky  lie  iodides,  when  decomposed  by  potassic  hydrate 
and  distilled,  yield  the  same  body  : 

N(C2H5)8  +  C,H5I  =  N(C2H5)4I 

N(C2H5)4I  +  KOH  =  KI  +  H20  +  N(C2H5)3  +  C2H4. 

Secondary  amines,  on  the  contrary,  by  similar  treatment  yield  a 
higher  homologue  (a  compound  richer  in  carbon  and  hydrogen),  being 
converted  into  tertiary  amines  : 

N(C2H5)2H  +  CaHsI  =  N(C2H5)3HI 

N(C2H5)3HI  +  KOH  =  N(C2H5)3  +  KI  +  OH2. 

Primary  amines  admit  of  this  process  of  enrichment  of  the  carbon 
and  hydrogen  contents  being  performed  twice,  and  it  is  not  until  a

The  primary  amines  can  also  be  easily  obtained  in  the  pure  state 
by    reduction  of  the  nitro-ethanes  (§  289)  with  nascent  hydrogen. 

The  amines  can  be  converted  back  into  the  alcohols  by  heating

is  then  distilled  with  potassic  hydrate.  Methylamine  is  also  formed 
by  the  dry  distillation  of  various  alkaloids  with  sodic  or  potassic 
hydrate — e.g.  caffeine,  theobromine,  creatinine,  morphine,  and  codeine. 
It  is  also  found  in  coal  tar  and  in  the  oily  products  of  the  distillation 
of  animal  substances  (animal  oil). 

Methylamine  is  a  colourless  gas  of  intense  odour,  somewhat  re- 
sembling that  of  putrefying  fish.  At  some  degrees  below  0°  it 
becomes  liquid.  Its  vapour  density  is  1  '08.  It  is  easily  inflammable 
and  burns  with  a  yellow  flame ;  it  is  more  soluble  in  water  than 
any  other  gas,  one  volume  of  water  at  12°  absorbing  1,150  volumes 
of  methylamine.  The  aqueous  solution  precipitates  metallic  salts 
like  ammonia ;  if  employed  in  excess  it  redissolves  the  hydrates  of 
zinc  and  copper,  but  not  those  of  cadmium,  cobalt,  and  nickel. 

Treated  with  the  halogens,  it  forms  bodies  corresponding  to  the 
haloid  compounds  of  nitrogen,  the  amide  hydrogen  atoms,  however, 
being  the  only  ones  replaced  by  halogen.  From  an  aqueous  solution 
of  methylamine  iodine  precipitates  garnet-red  diiodomethyl  amine, 
whilst  methylammonic  iodide  remains  in  solution  :

chloride,  or  methylamine  hydrochloride,  N(CH3)Ii3Cl,  crystallises  in 
large  colourless  plates,  which  deliquesce  in  moist  air.  It  melts  at  a 
little  above  100°,  volatilises  at  a  higher  temperature,  and  condenses 
unaltered  on  cooling.  The  platino-chloride,  [N(CH3)H3]2PtClfi,  forms 
golden  yellow  scales,  soluble  in  hot  water,  insoluble  in  alcohol.  The 
auro-chloride,  N(CH3)H3.AuCl4,  crystallises  in  golden  yellow  needles, 
readily  soluble  in  water,  alcohol,  and  ether. 

Neutral  methyl  amnionic  sulphate,  [N(CH3)H3]2S04,  and  the 
nitrate  N(CH3)H3.O.N02  are  easily  soluble  in  water,  the  latter  also 
in  alcohol. 

With  platinous  chloride  methylamine  forms  the  salts  of  methy-

dissolves,  and  yields  on  evaporation  crystals  of  PtN4C4H20Cl2.  The

270.  Only  a  few  bodies  of  the  series  of  secondary  amines  have 
been  prepared  in  the  pure  state  and  thoroughly  investigated.  Their 
formation  from  the  primary  amines  has  been  already  mentioned,  as  has 
their  general  chemical  behaviour.  With  nitrites  they  behave  in  com- 
pletely different  manner  to  the  primary  amines  and  ammonia.  By 
heating  their  nitrites,  obtained  by  mixing  their  hydrochlorides  with 
potassic  nitrite,  water  and  a  nitroso  body  are  found.  For  example,  if 
an  aqueous  solution  of  diethyl  ammonic  nitrite  be  heated,  an  oil,  boiling 
at  177°,  separates,  which  is  nitroso-diethylamine  or  nitroso-diethyline  :

Dimethylamine,  N(C2H5)2H,  metameric  with  ethylamine,  boils  at 
between  8°  and  9°.  Its  hydrochloride  gives  with  platinic  chloride  a 
double  salt,  crystallising  in  beautiful  needles,  [N(CH3)2H2]2PtCl6. 

Diethylamine,  N  I  'JI-,  )2H,  metameric  with  the  butylamines,  boils 
at  57°,  and  is  miscible  with  water  in  every  proportion. 

The  above-mentioned  nitroso-diethylamine  is  converted  by  alcoholic 
potassic  hydrate  into  monethylamine  ;  the  reaction  is  complicated,  but 
may  probably  be  represented  by  the  equation  : 

4X(C2H,)o(NO)  +  SKOH  =  4X(C,H5)H9  +  4NH3 
+  2C2H4  +  4K2C03. 

Treated  with  sodium  amalgam,  it  is  reconverted  in  presence  of  water 
into  diethylamine,  nitrous  oxide  being  evolved  : 

2N(C2H:i),(NO)  +  4H  =  2N(CSHS)H  +  H20  +  N,0.

271.  Nitrous  acid  acts  with  difficulty  on  these  compounds ;  their 
nitrites  also  are  more  stable  than  those  of  the  leas  substituted  bodies. 

Trimethylaminc  occurs  ready-formed  in  herring  pickle.  From  this 
it  can  be  obtained  mixel  with  ammonia  by  distillation  with  sodic 
hydrate.  The  distillate  is  saturated  with  hydrochloric  acid,  evaporated 
to  dryness,  and  the  residue  extracted  with  strong  alcohol,  in  which 
ammonic  chloride  dissolves  but  little.  The  filtered  alcohol  solution  is 
then  evaporated,  and  the  trimethylammonic  chloride  distilled  with 
potassic  hydrate. 

Trimethylamine  also  occurs  in  the  stinking  goose-foot  (Chenopo-

even  by  long  boiling  with  it.  With  iodine  it  unites  to  form  tetrame- 
thylammonic pentaiodide,  N(CH3)4I5,  which  crystallises  in  brilliant 
metallic  black  crystals.  Tetramethylammonic  hydrate,  prepared  from 
the  iodide  by  action  of  freshly  precipitated  argentic  oxide,  is  crystal- 
line, very  deliquescent,  and  eagerly  absorbs  carbonic  anhydride  from 
the  air.  The  nitrate  N(CH3)4.O.N02  crystallises  in  long  brilliant 
prisms.  The  chloride  N(CH3)4C1  gives  with  platinic  chloride  a 
double  silt  crystallising  in  orange  yellow  octahedra,  [N(CH3)4]2PtCl6. 
On  strong  heating  tetramethylammonic  hydrate  splits  up  into  tri- 
methylamine  and  methylic  alcohol : 

N(CH3)4.OH  =  N(CH3)3  +  CH3.OH. 

274.  Tetrethylammonic  iodide,  N(C2H5)4I,  is  readily  soluble  in 
water  and  alcohol.  With  alcoholic  solution  of  iodine  it  yields  bluish 
black  crystals  of  azure  blue  lustre  of  tetrethylammonic  triiodide, 
N(C2H=,)4I3,  which  melt  at  142°.  Tetrethylammonic  hydrate  crystal- 
lises in  vacuo  in  hairlike  crystals,  which  are  very  deliquescent.  On

Secondary  Hydrazines. 

The  unsynmietrical  hydrazines  of  the  fatty  series  are  pro  luced 
almost  quantitatively  by  the  reduction  of  the  nitrosamines  by  zinc 
dust  and  acetic  acid,  the  symmetrical  hydrazines  by  the  reduction  of 
the  corresponding  azo  compounds.  Both  varieties  are  simultaneously 
produced  by  the  action  of  alkyl  haloids  on  the  primary  hydrazines. 

Diethylhydrazine,  (C2H5)2N.NH2,  is  obtained  by  the  careful 
reduction  of  diethyl  nitrosamine  with  zinc  and  acetic  acid. 

After  the  termination  of  the  reaction  it  is  separated  from  the  ziuc ; 
and  the  filtrate,  after  addition  of  excess  of  sodic  hydrate,  is  distilled 
with  steam,  best  from  a  copper  vessel.  The  watery  distillate,  which 
contains  h)7drazine, -ammonia,  and  diethylamine,  is  saturated  with 
HC1  and  evaporated  to  remove  as  much  amnionic  chloride  as  possible. 
Hydrazine  and  diethylamine  are  separated  from  this  filtrate  on 
addition  of  potash  as  an  oil.  To  separate  the  hydrazine  the  oily  mix- 
ture is   treated  with  cyanic  acid,  thus  forming 

Diethylhydrazine  urea,  difficultly  soluble  in  water  and  alcohol, 
and  which  may  thus  be  easily  purified.  It  is  finally  distilled  with  solid 
potash  or  baric  hydrate,  and  obtained  as  a  colourless  liquid  of  ethereal 
ammoniacal  odour,  boiling  at  96°-99°  and  soluble  in  most  of  the 
ordinary  solvents.  It  is  a  monacid  base,  and  gives  salts  easily  soluble

These  latter  can  combine  with  two  molecules  of  hydrochloric  acid,

If  triethyl  melamine  be  submitted  to  dry  distillation,  it  splits

merises to  isocyanurate. 

By  an  analogous  reaction  the  isocyanurates  are  also  prepared  by

The  formation  from  the  trialkylic  derivatives  of  melamine  has  been

The  isocyanurates  of  the  alcohol  radicals,  so  far  as  they  have  been 
prepared,  are  crystalline  bodies  of  pretty  high  melting  and  boiling 
point,  and  can  be  crystallised  from  hot  water,  alcohol,  and  ether. 
They  are  decomposed  on  boiling  with  alkalies  (similarly  to  the  pseudo- 
cyanates),  into  carbonates  and  primary  amines  : 

C303(N.CnH2n  +  1)3  +  6HOK  =  3CO(OK)2  +  3N(CnH2n+1)H2. 

The  best  known  compounds  of  this  series  are  the  following : — 

Trimethylic  isocyanurate,  C303(N.CH3)3,  forms  colourless,  brilliant 
prismatic  crystals,  which  melt  at  175°  and  boil  at  295°.  Their 
vapour  density  is  5 '9  2°. 

'/'//<  thylic  isocyanurate,  C303(N.C2H5)3,  crystallises  in  rhombic 
prisms,  which  melt  at  85°  and  boil  at  276°. 

If  triethylic  isocyanurate  be  boiled  with  baric  hydrate  solution 
until  the  precipitation  of  baric  carbonate  ceases,  and  the  filtrate,  freed 
from  excess  of  baric  hydrate  by  carbonic  acid,  evaporated,  a  viscous

196       DERIVATIVES  OF  THE   ALCOHOL  RADICALS,   CnH2n+1. 

In  the  crude  triethylic  isocyanurate,  obtained  by  the  dry  distillation 
of  potassic  ethylic  sulphate  with  potassic  cyanurate,  there  is  also  a 
more  readily  soluble  body.  By  boiling  the  mother  liquor  of  the 
aqueous  crystallisation  with  baric  hydrate,  and  precipitation  of  the 
barium  by  sulphuric  acid,  there  is  obtained,  on  evaporation  of  the 
nitrate,  hexagonal  prisms,  or  rhombohedrons  of  diethylic  cyanurate, 
CgNgC^CaHg^H,  which  melt  at  173°.  Its  structure  is  as  yet  un- 
known. 

Substituted  Ureas. 

282.  Ureas  containing  the  alcohol  radicals  have  not  yet  been  pre- 
pared from  urea  itself,  but  are  obtained  readily  from  the  isocyanates. 

Analogously  to  the  formation  of  urea  from  the  decomposition  of 
potassic  isocyanates  with  ammonic  salts  : 

C=O.NK  +  NH4C1  =  KC1  +  CO.(NH2)2, 

the  former  yields  with  the  salts  of  primary  amines  the  mono-alkylic 
ureas : 

C=O.NK  +  N(CnH2n  +  1)H3Cl  =KC1  +  CO<^nH2n  +  l)H 

On  decomposing  potassic  isocyanate  with  the  salts  of  secondary 
amines  a-dialkylic  ureas  are  formed  : 

CO.NK  +  N(CnH2n  +  1)2H2Cl  =  KC1  +  CO<^nH2n+1)2 

Metameric  with  these  latter  are  /3-dialkylic  ureas,  which  are  obtained 
from  alkylic  isocyanates  and  primary  amines : 

(CO)=N(CnH2n  +  1)  +  N(CnH»,  +  I)H,  =  CO<^jg|g»+|j| 

That  these  substituted  ureas  are  also  formed  by  the  decomposition  of 
the  isocyanates  with  water  has  already  been  mentioned  (§  280).  The 
reaction  occurs  without  doubt  in  two  stages,  in  the  first  according  to 
the  equation : 

CO 

||  +  H20  =  C02  +  N(CnH2n  + ,  )H2. 

N.CnH2n+  j 

Together  with  carbonic  anhydride,  a  primary  amine  is  formed,  which 
then  reacts  on  a  second  molecule  of  the  isocyanate. 

If  in  this  latter  reaction  a  secondary  amine  be  used,  a  trisubstituted 
urea  is  obtained : 

(CO)=N(CnH2n+0  +  N(C„H2n  +  1)2H  =  CO<£j^n+,)H 

The  tertiary  amines  are  without  action  on  the  isocyanates  of  potas- 
sium and  the  alcohol  radicals. 

As  by  these  methods  polysubstituted  ureas  can  also  be  prepared 
containing  different  alcohol  radicals,  the  number  of  possible  com- 
pounds in  this  group  is  very  large.  The  reactions  of  the  alkylic 
derivatives  of  urea  correspond  in  many  points  with  those  of  the 
parent  body.  They  unite  with  acids  to  form  saline  compounds, 
which   contain   only  one  equivalent   of  the  acid;  by  heating   with 


UBEAS.  197 

aqueous   acids   or   alkalies   they   are   all  decomposed   into   carbonic 
anhydride  and  amines  :

C0<n|S";)H+  2HOK  =  CO(OK)2  +  N(CnH2n+1)2H 
+  N(C„H2n  +  1)H2. 

At  higher  temperatures,  however,  they  show  a  difference  in  be- 
haviour. The  mono  derivatives,  similarly  to  urea,  cannot  be  distilled 
unchanged,  but  give  primary  amines  and  cyanuric  acid,  whilst  the 
di  and  tri  derivatives  distil  unaltered. 

283.  The  following  are  the  more  important  of  the  numerous  com- 
pounds known  : — 

Methyl  urea,  H2N — CO — N(CH3)H,  forms  long  prisms,  deli- 
quescent in  moist  air,  from  whose  concentrated  solution  nitric  acid

Ethyl  urea,  H2N — CO — N(C2H5)H,  crystallises  in  readily  soluble

nitrate  is  readily  soluble. 

a-Diethyl  urea,  H2N — CO — N(C2H5)2,  prepared  from  potassic

alcoholic  solution  of  a  primary  amine  be  mixed  with  carbonic  di-

161°-163°.  Another  butylic  salt  forms  the  chief  constituent  of  the 
ethereal  oil  of  scurvy  grass  (Cochlearia  officinalis).  It  boils  at 
159°-160°,  and  yields  with  ammonia  a  different  urea  to  that  given 
by  the  first. 

Isoamylic  isosulpho-cyanate,  CSN.CH2.CH2.CH<^tt3,  is  an  oily

prepared  by  heating  ethylammonic  ethyl-sulpho-carbamate,  and  by 
union  of  ethylic  isosulpho-cyanate  with  ethylamine3  forms  large 
crystals,  which  melt  at  77°.  Their  aqueous  solution  gives  with 
platinic  chloride  a  bright  yellow  crystalline  precipitate.

Methyl  guanidine  had  been  known  for  a  long  time,  under  the  name 
of  methyl  uramine,  as  a  product  of  the  action  of  mercuric  oxide  upon 
creatine  and  creatinine. 

It  forms  a  colourless,  crystalline,  deliquescent  mass  of  strongly 
alkaline  reaction  and  caustic  ammoniacal  taste.  It  decomposes 
amnionic  salts,  precipitates  metallic  oxide  from  their  sal  .Ives 

aluminic  and  ferric  hydrates,  and  absorbs  carbonic  anhydride  from  the 
air. 

Its  crystalline  salts  contain  one  equivalent  of  acid  and  react 
slightly  alkaline.  The  hydrochloride  yields  with  platinic  chloride  a 
double  salt,  crystallising  in  the  monoclinic  system  and  of  the

Nitro-paraffins,  CnH2n  +  i.N02. 

289.  These  compounds,  isomeric  with  the  alkylic  nitrites  (§  213), 
are  readily  obtained  by  the  action  of  alkylic  iodides  upon  argentic 
nitrite,  which,  therefore,  probably  in  great  part,  is  not  the  salt 
Ag — 0 — NO,  but  Ag — N02.  The  reaction  goes  on  with  great  vio- 
lence according  to  the  equation  : 

C„H2n+  J  +  AgN02  =  Agl  +  CnH2n  +  1.N02. 

The  nitro-paraffin  is  distilled  from  the  argentic  iodide  and  purified 
by  fractionation. 

The  nitro-paraffins  are  distinguished  from  the  isomeric  alcoholic 
nitrites  by  their  much  higher  boiling  points  and  greater  stability. 
They  do  not  explode  on  heating.  A  property  peculiar  to  those 
poorer  in  carbon  (it  ceases  with  the  butyl  compounds)  is  their  power 
of  exchanging  one  atom  of  hydrogen  for  sodium,  this  occurring 
either  by  action  of  the  metal  on  ethereal  solution  of  the  nitro-paraffin 
or  by  treatment  with  sodic  hydrate  in  water  or  alcohol : 

2CnH2n  +  1.N02  +  Na2  =  H2  +  2CnH2nNa.N02. 
CnH2n  +  1.N02  +  NaOH  =  0H2  +  CnH2nHa.N02. 

This  first  reaction  by  employment  of  potassium  becomes  so  energetic 
that  the  mixture  inflames. 

In  these  compounds  the  alkali  metal  invariably  attaches  itself  to 
that  carbon  atom  to  which  the  N02  group  is  united  :

Sodium  nitro-ethane.  Sodium  nitro-isopropane. 

On  heating  the  dry  metallic  compounds  they  explode  violently. 
In  water  they  are  readily  soluble,  but  then  easily  decompose;  in 
alcohol  the  sodium  compounds  are  insoluble,  the  potassium  compounds 
soluble  and  readily  changed. 


NITRO-PARAFFINS.  205 

If  the  fresh  aqueous  solution  of  a  sodium  compound  be  acidulated, 
the  nitio  paialliti  si  pa  rates  unchanged  as  an  oil ;  if  mixed  with  salts  of 
heavy  metals,  the  latter  replace  the  sodium.  These  resulting  metallic 
nitro-paraffins  are  mostly  insoluble  precipitates.  The  silver  compounds, 
for  instance  : 

CnH2nNa(N02)  +  AgO.N02  =  NaO.N02  +  CnH2nAg(NO)2, 

are  curdy  precipitates,   which  rapidly  blacken,  owing  to  separation 
of  silver. 

When  the  fresh  aqueous  solutions  of  sodium  or  potassium  nitro- 
paraffins  (obtained  by  solution  of  nitro-paraffina  in  concentrated 
solutions  of  the  respective  hydrates)  are  slowly  mixed  with  bromine, 
the  brom-nitro-paralnns  separate  as  distillable  oils ;  e.g.

By  treatment  of  a  slightly  heated  alcoholic  solution  of  a  nitro- 
paraffin  with  acetic  acid  and  iron  filings,  reduction  to  the  acetate  of  a 
primary  amine  occurs :

Phosphorus  Compounds  of  the  Alcohol  Kadicals. 

293.  Similarly  to  the  derivation  of  the  amines  from  ammonia, 
phosphoretted  hydrogen,  PH3,  yields  alkylic  phosphine  bases. 

These  latter  show  the  property  of  uniting  with  acids  only  in  a  very- 
diminished  degree,  the  power  of  uniting  with  acids  decreasing  with 
increased  replacement  of  hydrogen  by  alcohol  radicals.  The  bodies 
belonging  hereto  form  the  following  groups  : 


PHOSPHINES.  207

Secondary         „       P(CnH2n+1)2H  „        „         N(OnH2n+ t),H. 

Tertiary  „       P(CnH2n  +  1)3  „        „         N(CnH2n  +  1)3. 

Quaternary  phosphonium  compounds,  P(CnH2n+1),X,  corresponding 
toN(CnH2n+1)4X. 

The  trivalent  phosphorus  compounds  are  distinguished  from  the 
corresponding  ammonia  derivatives  by  their  ready  oxidisability, 
absorbing  oxygen  by  mere  exposure  to  air,  often  with  spontaneous 
inflammation.  The  tertiary  phosphines  yield  oxides  of  the  formula 
P(CnH2n  +  1)30 ;  the  primary  and  secondary  phosphines  oxidising  to 
phosphinic  acids,  P(CnH2n  +  ,)2O.OH  and  P(CnH2n  +  j)0(OH)2. 

The  Alkylic  Phosphines. 

294.  Whilst  by  action  of  ammonia  on  alkylic  iodides  the  main 
products  of  the  reaction  are  primary  amines,  by  passing  PH3  into 
heated  alkylic  iodides  no  primary  or  secondary  phosphines  are  formed, 
but  only  tertiary  and  quaternary  phosphonium  iodides. 

The  result  is  just  the  same  in  the  reaction  between  phosphonic 
iodide,  (PH  4I),  and  alkylic  iodides.  In  order  to  obtain  the  primary 
and  secondary  phosphines,  the  reaction  between  the  two  last-mentioned 
bodies  must  take  place  in  presence  of  zincic  oxide. 

In  order  to  prepare  these  bodies,  two  molecules  of  phosphonic 
iodide,  one  molecule  of  zincic  oxide,  and  two  molecules  of  the  alkylic 
iodide  are  heated  in  sealed  glass  tubes  to  150°  for  six  to  eight  hours. 
The  tube,  when  cold,  contains  a  crystalline  mass,  which  consists  of  the 
hydrides  of  the  primary  and  secondary  phosphines  in  union  with 
zincic  iodide.  The  reactions  are  expressed  by  the  following  equa- 
tions : 

ZnO  +  2PIIJ  +  2CnH2n+1I  =  Znl2  +  2P(CnH2n  +  I)H3I  +  OH2, 

and 

ZnO  +  PH4I  +  2CnH2n+1I  =  Znl2  +  P(CnH2n+l)2H2I  +  Oil 

From  this  mixture  the  primary  and  secondary  phosphine  can  be 
readily  separated  from  one  another,  and  obtained  in  the  pure  state 
by  means  of  the  decomposition  of  the  primary  phosphonic  salt  by 
water : 

P(CnH2n+1)H3I  +  *H20  =  (HI  +  *H20)  +  P(CnH2n  +  1)H2, 

in  similar  manner  to  : 

PH.,1  +  zH20  =  (HI  +  xH20)  +  PI  I  , 

The  secondary  phosphonic  salts  are  not  altered  by  water,  but  are 
decomposed  by  alkaline  hydrates. 

In  consequence  of  the  spontaneous  inflammability  of  the  phos- 
pliines  the  decomposition  must  be  carried  on  in  filled  with  dry 

hydrogen. 

The  products  from  several  tubes  are  far  this  purpose  placed  in  a 
flask  a  standing  on  a  Band  bath  (fig.  L8).  The  flask  u  provided  with 
two  tubes  fixed  into  its  neck,  of  which   the   under  u,   bent  slightly

The  lower  end  of  the  condenser  tube  is  fitted  into  a  cylinder  i  which 
serves  to  collect  the  phosphine  that  passes  over,  and  which  can  be 
surrounded  by  a  freezing  mixture.  Any  uncondensed  phosphine 
vapour  passes  into  the  flask  k,  which  contains  concentrated  hydriodic 
acid.  This  absorbs  every  trace  of  phosphine  vapour,  with  separation 
of  the  crystalline  phosphine  hydriodide.  As  soon  as  the  whole 
apparatus  is  filled  with  hydrogen,  water  free  from  air  is  allowed  to

primary  phosphonic  iodide  decomposes,  with  evolution  of  much 
heat,  into  aqueous  hydriodic  acid  and  primary  phosphine,  which 
passes,  in  vapour,  through  b,  is  condensed,  and  collects  in  I.  During 
the  whole  process  a  slow  stream  of  hydrogen  passes  through  the 
apparatus.  As  soon  as  all  the  primary  phosphine  has  been  removed 
from  the  decomposition  flask  the  cylinder  I  is  changed,  an  excess  of

The  phosphines  so  obtained  are  separated  mechanically  from  the 
accompanying  water,  then  placed  with  quick-lime  in  an  apparatus 
similar  to  the  above,  only  containing  a  thermometer  instead  of  a  tap

odour,  which  resembles  that  of  the  isocyanides  (§  278).  Their  salts 
are  very  unstable,  are  decomposed  by  water  throughout  by  strong 
acids,  and,  with  exception  of  the  hydro-iodides  and  platino-chlorides, 
aiv  scarcely  known.  Exposed  to  air,  the  primary  phoephines  oxidise 
readily,  with  rise  of  temperature  and  formation  of  fumes,  often  inflam- 
ing spontaneously.  They  unite  directly  with  sulphur  and  carbonic 
disulphide,  forming  liquid  compounds.

alcohol   the   gas  is   pretty  readily  absorbed  (1  cc.  of  95  %  alcohol 

olving  about  20  cc.  of  the  gas  at  0°).  On  mixing  methyl  phos- 
phine  and  dry  hydrochloric  acid  gases  they  unite  to  form 

Methyl  phosphonic  chloride,  P(CH3)H3C1,  in  four-sided  plates, 
which  are  very  volatile  and  dissolve  readily  in  concentrated  hydro- 
chloric acid.  With  platinic  chloride  this  solution  yields  orange-

vapour  bleaches  cork  and  is  largely  absorbed  by  caoutchouc,  which 
thereby  becomes  transparent  and  looses  its  elasticity.  Ethyl  phosphine

energetically,  generally  taking  fire.  With  sulphur  and  carbonic 
disulphide  they  unite,  forming  liquids.  Their  salts  are  not  decomposed 
by  water,  but  in  consequence  of  their  great  solubility  are  mostly 
difficult  to  crystallise  with  the  exception  of  the  hydriodides. 

Dimethyl  phosphine,  P.(CH3)2H,  boils  at  25°  (as  does  the  meta- 
meric  ethyl-phosphine).  It  takes  fire  on  exposure  to  ah-.  The  pla'tino- 
chloride,  [P(CH3)2H201]2PtCl4,  is  crystalline. 

Diethyl  phosphine,  P(C2H5)2H,  is  a  light,  spontaneously  inflam- 
mable liquid  of  boiling  point  85°.  [P(C2H5)2H2Cl]2PtCl4  crystallises 
in  large  orange  yellow  prisms. 

Diisopropyl  phosphine,  P(C3H7)2H,  boils  at  118°  and  takes  fire 
on  exposure  to  air. 

Methyl-isopropyl  phosphine,  N.CH3.C3H7.H,  is  obtained  from 
its  hydriodide  (formed  directly  from  isopropyl  phosphine  and 
methylic  iodide)  as  a  spontaneously  inflammable  liquid  which  boils 
at  78°-80°. 

Diisobutyl  phosphine,  P(C4H9)2H,  boils  at  153°. 

Diisoamyl  phosphine,  P(C5Hn)2H,  boils  at  210°-215°.  It  is  not 
spontaneously  inflammable,  but  oxidises  on  exposure  to  air,  forming 
white  fumes. 

Tertiary  Phosphines. 

297.  The  tertiary  phosphines  can  be  prepared  by  various  methods, 
of  which  several  have  already  been  mentioned.  Their  hydriodides 
are  formed,  together  with  quaternary  phosphonic  iodides,  by  heat- 
ing pbosphonic  iodide  with  alky  lie  iodides  in  sealed  glass  tubes  at 
160°-180° : 

PH4I  +  3CnH2n+1I  =  P(CnH2n+1)3HI  +  3HI, 
and 

PH4I  +  4CnH2n+  J  =  P(CnH2n+1)4I  +  4HI; 

at  the  same  temperature  also  from  phosphonic  iodide  and  alcohols  : 

PH4I  +  3CaH2n  +  1.OH  =  P(CnH2n  +  1)3HI  +  3H20, 
and 

PH4I  +  4CnH2n  +  1.OH  =  P(CnH2n  +  1)4I  +  4H20; 

and  by  absorption  of  gaseous  phosphoretted  hydrogen  by  heated 
alcoholic  iodides  : 

PH3  +  3CnH2n+1I  =  P(CnH2n+1)3HI  +  2HI,  &c. 

If  the  products  of  these  reactions  be  heated  with  potassic  hydrate 
solution,  the  tertiary  phosphine  separates  as  a  liquid  floating  on  the 
aqueous  solution : 

P(CnH2n+1)3rII  +  KOH  =  P(CnH2n+1)3  +  KI  +  H20, 

whilst  the  quaternary  phosphonic  salts  are  not  attacked  by  the 
alkali. 

Tertiary  phosphines  are  also  prepared  by  heating  phosphorus 
with  alkylic  iodides  to  160°  and  afterwards  heating  the  resulting 
product  with  the  respective  alcohols  to  the  same  temperature. 

They  are  readily  obtained  by  mixing  the  zinc  compounds  of  the 
alcohol  radicals  with  phosphorous  trichloride  in  vessels  filled  with 
carbonic  anhydride.     As  the  reaction  is  very  violent,  the  zinc  com-

pound   must   be  diluted  with  ether,  and  the   phosphorous  chloride 
slowly  dropped  in : 

3Zn(CnH2n+1)2  +  2PC13  =  2P(CnH2n+1)3  +  3ZnCl2. 
The  tertiary  amino  is  not,  however,  in  the  free  state,  but  united  with 
the  zincic  chloride;  on  evaporating  the  ether,  and  heating  the  raridue 
with  potassic  hydrate,  the  tort Lary  phosphine  is  obtained  as  e  layer 
floating  on  the  aqueous  liquid.  It  is  separated  mechanically  from 
the  latter,  dried  by  fused  potassic  hydrate,  and  rectified  in  a  current  of 
hydrogen. 

The  known  tertiary  phosphines  are  liquids  insoluble  in  water,  but 
niiscible  with  alcohol  and  ether;  they  eagerly  absorb  an  atom  of 
oxygen  from  the  air,  and  frequently  take  fire. 

They  similarly  and  with  much  evolution  of  heat  unite  with 
one  atom  of  sulphur,  P(OnH2n  +  1)3S,  or  two  atoms  of  a  halogen, 
P(CnH2n+  i)3Cl2.     The  latter  compounds  are  all  crystalline. 

The  most  characteristic  reaction  for  tertiary  phosphines  is  their 
behaviour  towards  carbonic  sulphide.  If  the  latter  be  mixed  with  a 
tertiary  phosphine,  which,  to  moderate  the  violence  of  the  action,  has 
been  diluted  with  several  times  its  volume  of  ether,  they  both  com- 
bine, with  considerable  evolution  of  heat,  to  compounds  of  the  formula 
P(CnH2n+1)3CS2,  which  on  evaporation  of  the  solvent  are  obtained 
in  red  crystals.     These  bodies  appear  to  have  the  composition  :

The  salts  of  the  tertiary  phosphines  not  being  decomposed  by 
water,  can  be  prepared  by  means  of  aqueous  acids,  and  are  mostly 
readily  soluble.

boils  at  40°-42°  and  inflames  spontaneously  in  the  air. 

Triethyl  phosphine,  P((\,H -,).,,  has  sp.  gr.  '812  at  15J,  and  boils 
at  127*5°.  The  odour  is  benumbing,  but  when  much  diluted  with  air 
resembles  that  of  hyacinths.  The  hydro-acid  compound  can  be  readily 
obtained  in  crystals. 

Triethyl  phosphonic  chloride,  P(C2H5)3HC1,  gives  with  plat  inn- 
chloride  a  double  salt  of  the  formula  [P^H^HCl^Ptri,,  difficultly 
soluble  in  water,  insoluble  in  alcohol.  The  carbonic  disulphide  com-

or      P(CnH2n+  Oa  +  Cn,H2n,+  J  =  P(CnH2n+  1)3(C„-H2n,+ ,)!. 

They  are  not  decomposed  by  strong  solutions  of  alkaline  hydrates,  but 
are  precipitated  in  crystals  from  their  aqueous  solutions. 

If  the  solution  of  such  an  iodide  be  shaken  with  freshly  precipi- 
tated argentic  oxide,  argentic  iodide  separates  and  quaternary  phos- 
phonic  hydrates  are  formed  : 

P(CnH2n+1)4I  +  AgOH  =  Agl  +  P(CnH2n+1)4OH. 

These  hydrates  completely  resemble  the  quaternary  ammonic 
hydrates.  They  react  strongly  alkaline,  have  a  caustic  action,  eagerly 
absorb  carbonic  anhydride  from  the  air,  and  completely  neutralise  the 
strongest  acids.  They  are  crystallisable,  but  extremely  soluble  and 
deliquesce  in  the  air.  Their  salts  are  also  mostly  soluble  in  water. 
The  platino-chlorides  crystallise  in  difficultly  soluble  octahedra. 

Whilst  the  quaternary  ammonic  compounds  on  distillation  decom- 
pose into  tertiary  amine,  water,  and  olefine,  the  phosphonium  hydrates, 
in  consequence  of  the  strong  affinity  of  oxygen  for  phosphorus,  yield 
oxides  of  tertiary  phosphines  and  the  respective  paraffins  : 

P(CnH2n+1)4.OH  =  P(CnH2n+1)30  +  CnH2n  +  2. 

Tetra-ethyl  and  tetramethyl  compounds  have  been  especially  in- 
vestigated; the  iodides  are  first  prepared,  from  these  the  hydrates, 
P(CH3)4.OH  and  P(C2H5)4.OH,  and  many  of  their  salts.  Iodides

position. Concentrated  hydrochloric,  hydrobromic,  and  hydriodic 
acids  convert  it  into  triethyl  phosphine  dichloride,  P(C2H5)3C12, 
dibromide,  P(C2H5)3Br2,  and  diiodide,  P(C2H5)3I2,  crystalline  com-

To  obtain  the  free  acid,  the  silver  is  removed  from  the  filtrate  by

Dimethyl  phosphinic  acid,  P(CH3)2O.OH,  solidifies  to  a  paraffin-

Ethyl  phosphinic  acid,  prepared  from  ethyl  phosphine  by  the  same 
method  as  the  preceding,  resembles  spermaceti  at  ordinary  tempera- 
tures, melts  at  44°,  and  though  difficult  to  moisten  with  water  is 
largely  soluble  therein.  Its  salts  correspond  to  those  of  methyl  phos- 
phinic  acid. 

Other  Phosphorus  Compounds  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals. 

305.  By  action  of  methylic  chloride  on  phosphide  of  calcium  at 
high  temperatures,  diphosphor  tetramethyl  or  phosphor  cacodyl  (com- 
pare cacodyl,  §  318),  P2(CH3)4,  is  obtained  as  a  thick  oily  liquid, 
which  boils  ac  250°  and  inflames  when  exposed  to  air.  Its  formation 
is  analogous  to  that  of  liquid  phosphoretted  hydrogen,  P2H4,  which  it 
corresponds  to  : 

P=Ca  P=(CH3)2 

|  +  4CH3C1  =  2CaCl2  +     | 

P=Ca  P=(CH3)2 

As  liquid  phosphoretted  hydrogen  on  contact  with  hydrochloric 
acid  decomposes  into  the  solid  and  gaseous 

5P2H4  =  6CH3  +  P4H2, 

so  similarly  the  methyl  compound  decomposes  into  trimethyl  phos- 
phonic  chloride  and  tetra-phosphor-diinethyl : 

5P2(CH3)4  +  6HC1  =  6P(CH3)3HC1  +  P4(CH3)2. 

The  latter  is  an  amorphous,  odourless,  and  tasteless  yellow  body. 

Arsenic  Compounds  of  the  Radicals. 

306.  The  compounds  of  arsenic  with  the  alcohol  radicals  show 
some  similarities  to  the  nitrogen  compounds.  The  quaternary  arsonic 
salts  derived  from  the  strongly  basic  tetralkyl  arsonic  hydrates, 
As(CnH2n+1)4.OH,  agree  completely  in  chemical  character  with  the 
corresponding  ammonic  compounds. 

The  tertiary  arsines  are  also  known;  they  are  destitute  of  the 
distinctly  basic  properties  which  the  tertiary  phosphines  possess,  but, 
like  these  latter,  they  unite  with  one  atom  of  oxygen  or  sulphur  or 
two  halogen  atoms. 

Compounds  corresponding  to  the  primary  and  secondary  amines 
and  phosphines  are  entirely  wanting  in  the  arsenic  compounds,  but 
compounds  of  one  atom  of  arsenic  united  with  two  alcohol  radicals 
form  the  mono-  or  trivalent  radical  of  the  so-called  cacodyl  derivatives, 
where  they  are  in  union  with  negative  elements  : 

As(CnH2n  +  1)2Cl  and  As(CnH2n  +  1)2Cl3. 

In  similar  manner  one  alcohol  radical  united  to  arsenic  appears  as  a 
divalent  or  quadra valent  radical : 

As(CnH2n+1)Cl2  and  As(CuH2n  +  1)Cl4. 

307.  The  compounds  in  which  arsenic  is  triad,  such  as 
As(CnH2n  +  1)3,  As(CnH2n  +  1)2Cl,  and  As(CnH2n+1)Cl2, 

are   mostly   volatile   without   decomposition ;  those  in   which  it  is

pentad,  such  as  As((\,  II, I1  +  1),('l,  As(< ',,11,,,^,) 
and  As(CnH2n+1)Cl4,  decompose  at  more  or  lean  high   temporal 
losing  one  halogen  atom  and  one  alcohol  radical.     This  decomposition 
occurs  especially  readily  with  the  halogen  compounds,  and  the  tem- 
perature of  decomposition  is  the  lower  the  fewer  alcohol  radicals  and 
the  more  halogen  atoms  the  molecule  contains.     The  alkyl  arsenic 
compounds  can  therefore,  by  a  series  of  manipulations,  be  converted 
into  trivalent  inorganic  arsenic  compounds.     Such  . 
is  the  following  : 

As(CnH2n+1)4Cl  by  heating  =  As(CnH2n  +  1)3  +  CnH2n+1<  1 
As(CnH2n+1)3  +  Cl2  at  ord.  temperatures  =  As(CnH2n  +  i)3Cl2 
As(CnH2n+  i)801a  by  heating  =  As(CnH2n+  ,)aCl  +  CnH2n+  ,C1 
As(CnH2n+  ,)2C1  +  Cl2  in  the  cold  =  As(C„H2n+1)2Cl3 
As(CnH2n  +  i)aCl3  at  40°-50°  =  As(CnH2n+I)Cl2  +  CnH2n+1Cl 
As(CnH2n+1)Cl2  4-  Cl2  in  a  freezing  mixture  =  As(CnH2n  + j)Cl4 
As(CnH2n+  ,)C14  even  at  0°  =  AsCl3  +  C„H2n+  ,<  "1. 

All  alkyl  arsenic  compounds — especially  the  volatile  ones — are 
in  the  highest  degree  poisonous,  so  that  their  preparation  and  in- 
vestigation require  extraordinary  precautions. 

Quaternary  Arsonium  Compounds. 

308.  By  heating  alkylic  iodides  with  sodic  or  zincic  arsenide  in 
apparatus  filled  with  dry  carbonic  anhydride  violent  reaction  occurs, 
by  which  partly  cacodyls,  As2(CnH2n  +  1)4,  but  in  larger  proportion 
tertiary  arsines,  As(CnH2n  +  1)3,  are  formed.  If  the  alkylic  iodide  be 
employed  in  excess  it  forms  crystalline  quaternary  arsonic  iodides, 
according  to  the  equation  : 

AsNa3  +  4CnH2n+1I  =  3NaI  +  As(C„H2n  +  ,)4T. 

These  latter  are  only  separated  from  the  sodic  iodide  with  difficulty; 
it  is  more  usual,  therefore,  to  avoid  excess  of  the  iodide,  and  to  purify 
the  more  volatile  tertiary  arsine  from  the  cacodyl  by  fractional  distil- 
lation. It  is  then  mixed  with  the  alkylic  iodide,  and  soon  yields  at 
ordinaiy  temperature  the  arsonic  iodide  : 

As(CnH2n  +  1)3  +  CnH2n  +  iI  =  As(CnH2n+,).,I, 

from  which,  by  shaking  its  aqueous  solution  with  freshly  precipi' 
argentic  oxide,  the  quaternary  arsonic  hydrate  is  obtained  : 

As(CnH2n+I)4T  +  AgO  11  =  Agl  +  As(cni  dl.

soluble  compounds,  which  react  strongly  alkaline,  precipitate  metallic 
hydrates  from  their  salts,  liberate  ammonia  from  ammonic  salts, 
absorb  carbonic  anhydride  from  the  air,  and  unite  with  acids  to  form 
salts.  The  latter  are  easily  prepared  by  the  decomposition  of  the 
iodides  with  soluble  silver  salts. 

309.  Tetramethyl  arsonic  iodide,  As(CH3)4I,  forms  colour- 
less shining  plates  or  prisms,  whose  hot  saturated  aqueous  solution 
dissolves  much  iodine,  and  on  cooling  yields  brown  metallic-looking 
needles  of  tetramethyl  arsonic  periodlde,  As(CH3)4I3.  Combined 
with  arsenious  iodide,  tetramethyl  arsonic  iodide  is  obtained  by  heat- 
ing powdered  arsenic  with  twice  its  weight  of  methyHc  iodide  in 
sealed  tubes  at  160°-175°  : 

As2  +  4CH3I=  As(CH3)4I,AsI3. 

The  compound  crystallised  from  hot  water  forms  orange  yellow 
tables,  which  with  solution  of  potassic  hydrate  give  tetramethyl 
arsonic  iodide,  potassic  iodide,  and  potassic  arsenite,  or  by  distillation 
with  solid  potassic  hydrate  gives  off  trimethyl  arsine.

hygroscopic. 

310.  By  action  of  tetramethyl  arsonic  iodide  upon  zinc  methyl  in 
an  atmosphere  of  carbonic  anhydride,  arsenic  pentamethylide, 
As(CH3)5,  is  obtained  as  a  difficultly  volatile  Hquid  : 

2As(CH3)4I  +  Zn(CH3)2  =  Znl2  +  2As(CH3)5. 

311.  Tetrethyl  arsonic  iodide,  As(C2H5)4I,  crystallises  in  colour- 
less needles,  readily  soluble  in  alcohol  and  water,  insoluble  in  ether, 
and  gives  with  iodine  and  arsenious  iodide  compounds  exactly  analo- 
gous to  those  of  tetramethyl  arsonic  iodide.  Tetrethyl  arsonic  hydrate 
is  a  deliquescent,  strongly  alkaline  white  mass,  which  gives  with  hy- 
drochloric acid  the  deliquescent  crystalline  tetrethyl  arsonic  chloride 
As(C2H5)4Cl,4H20.  If  the  solution  of  the  latter  be  mixed  with 
platinic  chloride,  orange  red  crystals  slowly  separate,  difficultly  soluble 
in  cold  water,  of  the  double  salt  [As(C2H5)4Cl]2PtCl4. 

312.  The  best  known  mixed  arsonic  derivatives  are  those  of 
dimethyl-diethyl  arsonium :  the  iodide,  As(CH3)2(C2H5)2I;  the 
chloride,  which  crystallises  in  long  needles ;  the  platino-chloride, 
[As(CH3)2(C2H5)2Cl]2PtCl4,  in  orange  red  prisms;  the  nitrate, 
As(CH3)2(C2H5)2.O.N02,  in  deliquescent  granules;  and  the  sul- 
phate, [As(CH3)2(C2H5)2]2S04,  in  readily  soluble  octahedra. 

Tertiary  Arsines,  As(CnH2n  +  1)3. 

313.  The  preparation  of  tertiary  arsines  from  sodic  arsenide  and 
alcoholic  iodides  has  been  already  given  (§  308),  as  also  their  forma- 
tion by  the  dry  distillation  of  quaternary  arsonic  compounds,  more 
particularly  in  the  presence  of  solid  alkaline  hydrates.     The  tertiary 


,,iiaky  aksines.  219 

arsincs  known  are  distillablc  liquids  insoluble  in  water  and   of   I 
unpleasant  odour.     They  eagerly  absorb  oxygen  from  the  air,  with 
considerable  evolution  of  heat.     They  also  unite  with   sulphur  and 
the  halogens,  in  the  last  case  always  with  two  atoms. 

314.  Trimethyl  arsine,  A-i <  'I  I .,»..,  is  a  colourless  mobile  liquid, 
boiling  below  100°.  Trimethyl  arsine  oxide,  As(CH3)30,  resulting 
on  exposure  to  air  according  to  the  equation  : 


!As<^

forms  beautiful  crystals,  which  are  very  deliquescent.  The  sulphide, 
As(CH3)3S,  and  the  halogen  compounds,  As(CII3)3l2,  As(CH3)3Br, 
and  As(CH3)3Cl2,  are  crystalline  hygroscopic  bodies. 

315.  Triethyl  arsine,  As(C2H5)3,  is  also  a  colourless  liquid,  not 
miscible  with  water.  At  140°  it  begins  to  distil,  with  slight  decom- 
position and  separation  of  metallic  arsenic.  It  fumes  in  the  air 
without  taking  fire,  and  is  converted  into  triethyl  arsine  oxide, 
As(C2H5)30,  a  heavy,  unpleasant-smelling  yellowish  oil. 

If  an  ethereal  solution  of  triethyl  arsine  be  boiled  with  flowers  of 
sulphur,  and  the  ether  evaporated  from  the  filtered  liquid,  triethyl 
arsine  sulphide,  As(C2H5)3S,  crystallises  in  fine  odourless  prisms, 
soluble  in  water,  alcohol,  and  ether,  and  melting  at  slightly  above 
100°. 

By  addition  of  an  ethereal  solution  of  iodine  to  one  of  triethyl 
ai  sine,  triethyl  arsine  diiodide,  As(C2H5)3I2,  separates  as  a  sulphur 
yellow  flocculent  precipitate,  readily  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether  and 
deliquescing  in  air  to  a  dark  syrup.  Triethyl  arsine  dibromide, 
As(C2H5)3Br2,  prepared  similarly  to  the  iodide,  forms  a  pale  yellow 
crystalline  mass,  which  is  soluble  in  ether  and  is  very  deliquescent. 

Dialkylarsenic  Compounds. 

316.  The  compounds  of  arsenic  with  two  alcohol  radicals  do  not 
occur  isolated,  but  in  molecules  containing  two  such  groups  united 
together  by  the  third  valence  of  the  arsenic  :

317.  In  addition  to  the  above  compounds  which  contain  the  arsenic 
in  the  trivalent  state,  cacodylic  compounds  are  also  known  in  which 
the  arsenic  is  pentavalent,  and  which  are  obtained  from  the  preceding 
by  direct  addition  of  negative  elements.  For  instance,  the  haloid

It  is  more  usual  to  prepare  it  by  the  action  of  metals,  especially  of

After  cooling  the  zincic  chloride  is  dissolved  by  addition  of  water, 
whilst  the  free  cacodyl  collects  at  the  bottom  as  a  heavy  oily  layer; 
this  is  separated  mechanically  from  the  zincic  chloride  solution,  dried 
by  means  of  calcic  chloride,  and  obtained  pure  by  distillation  in  an 
atmosphere  of  carbonic  anhydride. 

Cacodyl  so  obtained  is  a  clear,  colourless,  strongly  refractive  liquid, 
which  boils  at  about  170°  and  solidifies  to  an  ice-like  mass  at  —6°. 
On  coming  into  contact  with  atmospheric  air  it  inflames  and  burns 
with  a  livid  flame  : 

2As2(CH3)4  +  1702  =  2As203  +  8C02  +  12H20. 

By  heating  to  300°-400°  it  decomposes  completely  into  metallic 
arsenic  and  a  mixture  of  methane  and  ethylene.

The  liquid  which  comes  over,  on  account  of  its  poisonous  nature 
and  ready  inflammability,  must  be  collected  in  well-cooled  and  care- 
fully closed  vessels  under  water,  and  later,  after  mechanical  separation 
of  the  water,  be  distilled  from  baric  oxide  in  vessels  filled  with  dry 
carbonic  anhydride.  Obtained  anhydrous  in  this  way,  cacodylic 
oxide  forms  a  colourless,  strongly  refractive  liquid,  of  fearful  odour, 
whose  vapour  causes  nausea  and  vomiting.  Its  sp.  gr.  is  1*462 
solidifies  at  —25°  to  silky  scaly  crystals  ;  it-  boiling  point  is  150°.  It 
is  insoluble  in  water,  but  miscible  with  alcohol  and  ether.  The 
property  of  spontaneous  inflammability  in  air  of  this  preparation  is 
due  to  a  small  admixture  of  cacodyl.  When  mixed  with  a  little  water, 
purified  alkarsin  slowly  absorbs  oxygen  from  the  air,  and  is  converted 
into  a  syrupy  solution  of  cacodylic  cacodylate  :

Cacodylic  oxide  so  prepared  has  all  the  properties  of  purified 
alkarsin,  except  that  it  is  not  spontaneously  inflammable  on  exposure 
to  air ;  it  oxidises,  however,  slowly  first  to  cacodylic  cacodylate  and 
finally  to  cacodylic  acid. 

Cacodylic  oxide  combines  with  mineral  acids,  forming  salts  which 
are  mostly  difficultly  crystallisable.  Of  these  cacodylic  sulphate  is 
most  easily  prepared,  by  solution  of  cacodylic  oxide  in  warm  dilute

chloric acid  gas  into  crude  cacodylic  oxide,  and  subsequently  rectifying 
the  product  over  calcic  chloride  and  magnesia.  It  is  obtained  purer 
by  distillation  of  the  above-mentioned  cacodylic  oxide-mercuri-chloride 
with  hydrochloric  acid.  It  is  a  colourless  liquid  of  stupefying  odour. 
The  boiling  point  is  about  100°. 

Platinic  chloride  gives  with  a  hydrochloric  solution  of  cacodylic 
chloride  a  red  insoluble  pulverulent  precipitate  of 

[As(CH3)2Cl]2,PtCl4. 

Dimethyl-arsen  bromide,  or  cacodylic  bromide,  As(CH3)2Br,  is 
obtained  from  cacodylic  oxide-mercuri-chloride,  by  distillation  with 
concentrated  hydrobromic  acid,  as  a  liquid  resembling  the  chloride. 

Dimethyl-arsen  iodide,  cacodylic  iodide,  obtained  from  alkarsin  by 
distillation  with  concentrated  hydriodic  acid,  and  purified  by  distilla- 
tion from  quick-lime  and  from  calcic  chloride,  is  a  yellowish  liquid, 
boiling  much  above  100°. 

By  action  of  water  upon  the  monohaloid  derivatives  of  cacodyl 
one  quarter  of  the  halogen  is  withdrawn,  and  the  so-called  cacodylic 
oxyhaloids  are  formed,  of  which  As8(CH3)16Cl60  and  As8(CH3)16Br60 
are  liquids  fuming  on  exposure  to  air,  whilst  As8(CH3)16I60  is  a 
yellow  crystalline  mass.     All  three  can  be  distilled  apparently  un-

321.  Cacodylic  cyanide,  As(CH3)2.CN',  crystallises  in  large 
prisms  of  diamond  lustre,  of  melting  point  37°  and  boiling  point 
140°.  This  extremely  poisonous  body  is  obtained  by  distillation  of 
alkarsin  with  concentrated  hydrocyanic  acid  or  of  cacodylic  chloride 
with  mercuric  cyanide. 

322.  Dimethyl-arsen  trichloride,  cacodylic  trichloride)  As(CH.3)20\3, 
results  from  the  action  of  chlorine  gas  upon  cacodylic  chloride,  the 
latter  being  previously  diluted  with  carbonic  ditftdphide  in  order  to 
moderate  the  violence  of  the  reaction.  The  trichloride  sepai 
partially  in  crystalline  plates.  Another  method  of  preparation  con- 
sists in  the  action  of  phosphoric  chloride  on  cacodylic  acid,  placed 
under  anhydrous  ether : 

As(CH3)2O.OH  +  2PC15  =  As(CH3)2Cl3  +  HC1  +  2P0C13. 

It  is  dissolved  by  ether  or  carbonic  disulphide,  and  crystallises  on 
evaporation  of  these  solutions  in  clear  plates.  It  decomposes  at 
40°-50°  into  arsen-monomethyl  dichloride  and  methylic  chloride  : 

As(CH3)2Cl3  =  As(CH3)Cl2  +  CH3C1. 

By  water  it  is  readily  converted  into  cacodylic  chloro-dihydrate 
(§  324).

/CH3 

As(CH3)2O.OH  =  As=£Hs 

\)H 

Cacodylic  acid  is  usually  prepared  by  means  of  cacodylic  oxide  and 
mercuric  oxide.  For  this  purpose  alkarsin  is  added  to  several  times 
its  volume  of  water,  and  mercuric  oxide  slowly  added  with  gentle 
shaking  until  the  odour  of  alkarsin  has  completely  disappeared  : 

[As(CH3)2]20  +  2HgO  +  H20  =  2Hg  +  2As(CH3)2.O.OH. 

The  liquid  poured  off  the  reduced  mercury  contains  cacodylic  acid 
and  some  mercuric  cacodylate,  for  whose  complete  decomposition  a 
small  quantity  more  alkarsin  is  added.  By  evaporation  of  the  clear 
solution  cacodylic  acid  is  obtained  in  large  colourless  prisms,  which 
melt  at  200°,  with  partial  decomposition.  It  is  readily  soluble  in 
water,  difficultly  in  alcohol,  insoluble  in  ether.  The  solution  reacts 
and  tastes  decidedly  acid.  By  reducing  agents  it  is  reconverted  into 
cacodylic  oxide.  Oxidising  agents,  even  fuming  nitric  acid,  are  without 
action  on  it. 

It  reacts  on  metallic  oxides  and  carbonates,  forming  crystalline 
salts,  cacodylatea,  soluble  in  water.     Poi  rms  eon-

325.  Sulphides  of  Cacodyl. — Two  compounds  ofcacodyl  with 
sulphur  are  known. 

Cacodylic  sulphide,  [As(CH3)2]2S,  corresponds  in  composition  to 
cacodylic  oxide.  It  is  obtained  by  distillation  of  cacodylic  chloride 
with  baric  sulphide  : 

2AS<4|h:  +  BaS  =  BaCl2  +  S<^3>* 

as  a  colourless,  heavy,  oily  liquid,  which  mixes  with  alcohol  and  ether. 
It's  odour  is  penetrating  and  resembles  both  alkarsin  and  mercaptan. 
The  boiling  point  is  above  100°.  With  hydrochloric  acid  it  gives 
cacodylic  chloride  and  hydric  sulphide. 

Cacodylic  per  sulphide,  cacodylic  sulpho-cacodylate  :

corresponding  to  cacodylic  cacodylate,  is  formed  from  the  preceding  by 
direct  addition  of  sulphur,  as  also  from  cacodyl.  It  crystallises  in 
colourless  rhombic  tables,  which  are  readily  soluble  in  alcohol,  diffi- 
cultly in  water,  and  insoluble  in  ether,  and  which  melt  at  50°.  If  an 
alcoholic  solution  be  mixed  with  alcoholic  plumbic  acetate,  insoluble 
plumbic  sulpho-cacodylate  separates  in  colourless  nacreous  scales, 
whilst  the  solution  contains  cacodylic  acetate  :

=     isjcHit^  +  2As(CH3)2.O.C2H30. 

Other  salts  of  sulpho-cacodylic  acid  have  also  been  prepared,  but  all 
attempts  to  separate  the  free  acid,  As(CH3)2S.SH,  have  so  far  been 
unsuccessful. 

326.  Several  of  the  diethyl-arsen  compounds  or  ethyVcacodyl 
derivatives  have  been  prepared.  They  correspond  in  method  of  pre- 
paration and  properties  to  the  methyl  bodies.  The  starting  point  is 
diarsen-tetr ethyl,  As2(C2H5)4,  or  ethyl  cacodyl,  which  results,  together 


ARSEN-MONOMETHYL  COMPOUNDS.  225 

with  triethyl  arsine,  from  the  action  of  ethylic  iodide  upon  sodic 
arsenide,  and  on  fractional  distillation  of  the  product  passes  over  last, 
It  is  a  yellowish,  heavy  liquid,  boiling  between  185°  and  195°,  of  garlic 
odour,  and  is  spontaneously  inflammable  in  air.  It  unites  directly 
with  oxygen,  sulphur,  and  the  halogens.  By  addition  of  iodine,  e.g. 
diethyl-arsen  iodide,  As(C2H5)2I,  is  obtained  as  a  yellowish  oil  insolu- 
ble in  water. 

On  allowing  a  dilute  alcoholic  solution  of  ethyl  cacodyl  to  remain 
for  a  long  time  exposed  to  the  air,  it  is  slowly  converted  into  diethyl 
ar8onic  acid,  As(C2H^)2O.OH.  On  evaporation  it  is  obtained  in 
strongly  acid  crystals,  which  deliquesce  in  moist  air. 

Arsen-monomethyl  Compounds. 

327.  Of  the  monalkyl-arsen  derivatives  only  those  of  methyl  have 
been  obtained  in  a  state  of  purity  and  investigated.  If  cacodylic 
trichloride  be  submitted  to  distillation  (§  322)  it  evolves  methyl ic 
chloride  gas;  and  arsen-methyl  dichloride,  As(CH3)Cl2,  condenses  in 
the  receiver  as  a  heavy,  colourless,  strongly  refractive  liquid,  which 
boils  at  133°  and  is  pretty  soluble  in  water.  Its  vapour  attacks  the 
mucous  membrane  violently.  It  is  also  formed  by  the  distillation  of 
cacodylic  acid  in  an  atmosphere  of  hydrochloric  acid  :

As(CH3)Cl2  +  Na2C03  =  2NaCl  +  C02  +  As(0H3)0. 

After  evaporation  of  the  water  it  is  extracted  from  the  residue   by 
absolute  alcohol,  and  is  obtained  by  evaporation  of  the  filtered  Liquid 
in  short  prisms,  of  indifferent  reaction,  little   soluble  in  cold  water 
and  of  95°  melting  point.     It  is  also  formed  on   distilling  si 
dimethyl  chlorodihydrate,  or  cacodylic  acid  hydrochloride  :

In  the  presence  of  aqueous  vapour  it  volatilises.  By  the  haloid 
acids  and  by  sulphuretted  hydrogen  it  is  converted  respectively  into 
the  haloid  compounds  and  the  sulphides. 

Arsen-methyl  diiodide,  As(CH3)I2,  crystallises  in  long  brilliant 
yellow  needles,  which  melt  at  20°  and  distil  unaltered  at  above  200°. 

Arsen-methyl  sulphide,  As(CH3)S,  forms  brilliant  leaves  or  prisms, 
which  melt  at  110°.

Methyl  arsinic  acid,    AsIZqtt   .     This  dibasic  acid,  correspond-

ing  to  methyl  phosphinic  acid  (§  304),  is  usually  obtained  in  the 
free  state  by  addition  of  the  requisite  quantity  of  sulphuric  acid  to 
the  ba^ic  salt.  By  evaporation  of  its  aqueous  solution  it  is  obtained 
in  large  spear-shaped  laminae,  composed  of  small  dendritic  needles  of 

agreeable  acid  taste.  Baric  methyl  arsinate,  As(CH3)0<^0>Ba,  is  ob- 
tained from  the  mercuric  salt  by  addition  of  baric  hydrate  until  all 
mercuric  oxide  is  precipitated  and  evaporation  of  the  nitrate.  From 
its  dilute  aqueous  solution  alcohol  precipitates  the  same  salt  with  five 
molecules  of  water  of  crystaUisation  in  colourless  needles.  The  silver 
salt,  As(CH3)0.(OAg)2,  is  precipitated  from  solutions  of  the  baric  salt 
in  nacreous  crystals,  which  detonate  at  100°. 

Antimony  Compounds  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals. 

330.  Only  those  antimony  compounds  corresponding  to  the  tertiary 
arsines  and  quaternary  arsonium  compounds  are  known.  They  are 
in  nearly  all  respects  analogous  to  these  bodies. 

They  are  prepared  by  action  of  alkylic  iodides  upon  potassic 
antimonide.  This  alloy  is  best  prepared  by  carbonising  tartar  emetic 
(potassic  antimonylic  tartrate)  and  strongly  heating  the  product  in 
covered  vessels. 

The  reaction  between  the  finely  powdered  alloy  and  the  alkylic 
iodide  is  accompanied  with  great  evolution  of  heat.  The  resulting 
tertiary  stibine  is  then — if  its  boiling  point  be  not  too  high — distilled 
off  in  vessels  filled  with  carbonic  anhydride,  whilst  potassic  iodide 
and  excess  of  antimony  remain  behind  : 

SbK3  +  3CnH2n+1I  =  Sb(CnH2n+1)3  +  3KI. 

The  tertiary  stibines  oxidise  rapidly — often  spontaneously  inflam- 
ing— on  exposure  to  air,  forming  the  oxides  Sb(CnH2n+1)30,  which 
have  the  properties  of  a  diacid  basic  anhydride,  and  yield  hydric 
and  normal  salts  with  acids. 

Similarly  to  their  behaviour  with  oxygen,  the  tertiary  stibines 
unite  directly  with  one  atom  of  sulphur  or  two  atoms  of  halogen,  and 
further  unite  with  the  elements  of  a  molecule  of  an  alkylic  iodide 
to  quaternary  stibonium  iodides,  Sb(CnH2n  +  1),I,  from  which,  by 
action  of  argentic  oxide,  the  caustic,  alkaline  monacid  bases, 
Sb(CnH2n  +  1)4.OH,  can  be  prepared. 


ANTIMONY  COMPOUNDS.  227 

Antimon-methyl  Compounds. 

331.  Trimethyl stibine,  or  antimon-trimethyl,  Sb(CH3)3,  is  obtained, 
by  heating  methylic  iodide  witli  potassic  stibide,  as  a  heavy,  colourless 
liquid,  insoluble  in  water,  little  soluble  in  alcohol,  but  readily  in  ether. 
Kx  posed  to  air,  it  funics  and  soon  inflames  spontaneously.  Its  oxi<l<-. 
sulphide,  and  halogen  compounds  have  been  prepared,  but  not 
thoroughly  investigated;  they  completely  resemble  those  of  trimethyl 
stibine.  Trimethyl-stibine  diiodide,  Sb(( )H8) 8Ia,  can  be  also  prepared 
in  beautiful  crystals  by  direct  heating  of  powdered  antimony  with 
methylic  iodide  at  140°  : 

Sb4  +  9CH3I  =  3Sb(CH3)3I2  +  Sbl3. 

By  bringing  together  trimethyl-stibine  iodide  and  zinc  methyl,  and 
subsequent  distillation,  an  oily  liquid  passes  over  between  96°  and 
100°,  not  spontaneously  inflammable — antimon-pentamethyl — and  is 
formed  according  to  the  equation  : 

Sb(CH3)3I2  +  Zn(CH3)2  =  Znl2  +  Sb(CH3)5. 

332.  If  trimethyl  stibine  be  mixed  with  methylic  iodide,  combina- 
tion occurs  without  the  aid  of  extraneous  heat.  A  white  hard  mass  of 
tetramethyl  stibonic  iodide,  Sb(CH3)4I,  is  obtained,  which  dissolves  in 
hot  water,  and  on  cooling  separates  in  beautiful  hexagonal  tables. 
This  compound  is  readily  soluble  in  alcohol,  difficultly  in  ether.  On 
boiling  the  aqueous  solution  with  argentic  oxide,  argentic  iodide 
separates,  and  the  filtered  liquid  yields  on  evaporation  in  vacuo  a 
white  crystalline  deliquescent  mass  of  tetramethyl  stibonic  hydrate, 
Sb(CH3)4.OH;  this  is  a  strong  base,  has  a  caustic  action  like  that  of 
potassic  hydrate,  and  is  readily  soluble  in  alcohol.  On  slow  heating  it 
can  be  partially  volatilised  without  decomposition.  Its  salts  are 
obtained  directly  by  neutralisation  with  acids,  or  by  decomposition  of 
the  iodide  with  silver  salts. 

Triramethyl  stibonic  chloride,  Sb(CH3)4Cl,  and  the  bromide, 
Sb(CH3)4Br,  crystallise  like  the  iodide  in  hexagonal  tables  ;  the  first 
gives  with  platinic  chloride  an  orange  yellow  crystalline  precipitate  of 
the  formula  [Sb(CH3)4Cl]2,PtCl4. 

The  nitrate,  Sb(CH3)4O.N02,  prepared  by  double  decomposition 
of  the  iodide  with  argentic  nitrate,  crystallises  in  readily  salable 
prisms,  like  those  of  potassic  nitrate. 

The  sulphates  are  prepared  from  the  hydrate  and  sulphuric  add. 
The  normal  sulphate,  [Sb(<  '1 1 3),].JS(  >4,.r)II20,  forms  rhombic  efflo

228        DERIVATIVES   OF   THE  ALCOHOL  RADICALS,   C^S^,. 

It  is  insoluble  in  water,  miscible  in  every  proportion  with  alcohol 
and  ether. 

With  the  halogens  triethyl  stibine  combines  with  great  evolution 
of  heat,  so  that  the  ingredients  can  only  be  brought  together  in  strongly 
diluted  alcoholic  or  ethereal  solutions. 

Triethyl- stibine  dichloride,  Sb(C2H5)3Cl2,  is  obtained  by  heating 
triethyl  stibine  with  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid,  hydrogen  being 
evolved.  Triethyl  stibine  therefore  behaves  like  a  strongly  positive 
divalent  metal :

This  dichloride  is  a  colourless,  strongly  refractive  liquid  of  sp.  gr. 
1*54.  It  smells  like  turpentine,  tastes  bitter,  is  insoluble  in  water, 
but  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether. 

The  dibromide,  Sb(C2H5)3Br2,  resembles  the  chloride,  but  solidifies 
at  —10°  to  a  snow-white  crystalline  mass. 

The  diiodide,  Sb(C2H5)3I2,  forms  colourless  needles,  melting 
at  70°.

On  bringing  together  the  oxide  and  diiodide  of  triethyl  stibine  in

337.  Antimon-tetrethyl  or  Tetrethyl  Stibonic  Compounds. — A  mix- 
ture of  equal  molecules  of  triethyl  stibine  and  ethylic  iodide,  when 
covered  with  water,  slowly  solidifies  to  tetrethyl  stibonic  iodide, 
Sb(C2H5)4I,  which  by  recrystallisation  from  hot  water  is  obtained  in 
large  prisms  or  needles.  By  means  of  argentic  oxide  it  is  converted 
into  tetrethyl  stibonic  hydrate,  Sb(C2H5)4.OH,  a  strongly  alkaline 
syrupy  liquid,  which,  with  acids,  yields  neutral,  readily  soluble  salts, 
which  are  mostly  crystallisable.  As  they  resemble  those  of  tetrame- 
thyl  stibonium  in  all  respects,  they  may  be  passed  over. 

Methyl-triethyl  stibonic  iodide,  Sb(C2H5)3(CH3)I,  is  obtained  by 
direct  combination  of  triethyl  stibine  with  methylic  iodide. 

Amyl  Compounds. 

338.  By  action  of  isoamylic  iodide  upon  potassic  stibide  triisoamyl 
stibine  is  formed,  which  cannot  be  separated  by  distillation,  but  must 
be  extracted  from  the  product  by  ether;  on  evaporation  of  the  filtered 
solution  it  is  obtained  as  a  transparent  yellowish  liquid  of  sp.  gr. 
1*133.  It  fumes  strongly  in  the  air,  but  does  not  inflame  spon- 
taneously. With  two  atoms  of  halogen  it  yields  compounds  which 
are  insoluble  in  water. 

On  endeavouring  to  distil  this  body  a  liquid  passes  over  which  on 
heating  to  80°  evolves  an  antimonial  inflammable  gas,  and  leaves 
diantimon-tetrisoamyl : 

Sb  =  (C5Hu)2 
Bb,(0,HI1)4=   I 

Sb=(0,Hn), 

as  a  liquid  not  fuming  in  the  air,  but  which  slowly  oxidises.     It  cor 
responds  to  the  cacodyls  in  the  arsenic  compounds. 

Bismuth  Compounds  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals. 

339.  The  only  bismuth  compounds  yet  prepared  are  the  very 
unstable  ethyl  derivatives.  By  bringing  together  potassic  bismuthide 
(prepared  by  strong  heating  of  a  mixture  of  twenty  parts  of  bismuth 
with  sixteen  parts  of  powdered  acid  potassic  tartrate  in  a  Hessian 
crucible)  with  ethylic  iodide,  a  rather  violent  reaction  occurs.  The 
cooled  mixed  product : 

BiK3  +  3C2H5I  =  3KI  +  Bi(C2H5)3, 

after  soaking  with  water,  is  shaken  with  ether.  The  latter  removes 
Bismuth  triethyl,  or  triethyl  bismuthine,  Bi(C2H5)3,  which,  after 
mixing  with  water  and  distilling  off  the  ether,  remains  under  the  water 
as  a  yellowish  mobile  liquid  of  sp.  gr.  1*82.  Its  smell  is  extremely 
disagreea.ble  ;  it  fumes  in  the  air  and  inflames  spontaneously.     Even

A  dilute  alcoholic  solution  of  bismuth  triethyl  to  which    iodiu

Bi((  !2H5)3I2,BiI3  =  Bi2(C2H5)3I5.     it  is  still  more  readily  decom- 
posed  by  chlorine  and  bromine. 

340.  On  mixing  an  alcoholic  solution  of  bismuth  triethyl,  slightly 
acidified  with  hydrochlori  i  acid,  with  mercuric  chloride,  mercuric 
ethyl-chloride  separates,  whilst 

Bismuth  ethyl-tliclilo ri'l  ,  Bi(CaH6)Cl2,  remains  in  solution,  and  is 
obtained  by  evaporation  of  the  filtered  liquid  in  small  colourless 
crystals.     Its  formation  is  represented  by  the  equation  : 

C  II 

Bi(C2H5)3  +  2HgCl2  =  2Hg<£lf H*   +   Bi^Cl 

The  alcoholic  solution  of  this  compound  gives,  on  heating  withpot;i 
iodide,  potassic  chloride  and 

Bismuth  ethyl-diiodide  f  Bi(C2H5)Ir.  If  the  liquid  be  mixed  with 
water  until  strongly  clouded,  and  then  heated  until  again  clear, 
bismuth  ethyl-diiodide  crystallises  in  golden  yellow  hexagonal  plates. 
From  its  alcoholic  solution  potassic  hydrate  precipitates

Silicon  Compounds  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals. 

342.  The  tetravalent  element  silicon  combines  with  the  alcohol 
radicals  in  four  different  proportions.  Of  the  respective  compounds 
only  one  series,  Si(CnH2n  +  ^4,  occur  as  free  molecules,  in  all  the  other 
compounds  poorer  in  alcohol  radicals  the  silicon  being  further  united 
to  tetrad  saturation  with  negative  elements  (oxygen  or  halogen). 

The  respective  compounds  show,  in  accordance  with  the  similarity 
between  carbon  and  silicon,  certain  analogies  with  such  organic  bodies 
as  contain  a  carbon  atom  instead  of  the  silicon  atom,  but  are  other- 
wise of  like  composition. 

Silicon  tri-,  di-,  and  monalcohol  radical  compounds  are  obtained 
by  heating  ethylic  orthosilicate  (§  225)  with  organo-zinc  compounds 
and  sodium.  The  latter  cannot  be  dispensed  with,  as  the  zinc  com- 
pounds of  the  alcohol  radicals  are  without  action  on  the  orthosilicates. 
During  the  reaction  metallic  zinc  separates,  and  therefore  it  is 
not  organo-zinc  but  organo-sodium  compounds  which  effect  the  sub- 
stitution of  the  O.C2H5  group  by  alcohol  radicals.  The  first  reaction 
is  probably : 

2Si(OC2H5)4  +  Zn(C2H5)2  +  Na2  =  Zn  +  2NaOC2H5 
+  2Si(C2H5)(C2H50)3. 

By  employment  of  larger  quantities  of  zinc  ethyl  and  sodium  and  a 
longer  continuance  of  the  action,  the  substitution  is  greater  : 

Si(OC2H5)4  +  Zn(C2H5)2  +  Na2  =  Zn  +  2NaOC2H5 
+  Si(C2H5)2(C2H50)2 

2Si(OC2H5)4  +  3Zn(C2H5)2  +  3Na2  =  3Zn  +  6NaOC2H5 
+  2Si(C2H5)3(C2H50). 

A  single  one  of  the  respective  products  is,  however,  never  obtained, 
but  invariably  a  mixture,  from  which  the  pure  compounds  must  be 
separated  by  fractional  distillation. 

Silicon  Tetralkyls,  Si(CnH2n+i)4. 

343.  These  compounds,  which  correspond  to  paraffins  containing  a 


SILICON   COMPOUNDS.  233 

quaternary  united  carbon  atom,  C(CnHto+i)4,  are  obtained  by  heal 

silicic  chloride  with  the  zinc  compounds  of  the  alcohol  radicals  in 
sealed  tubes  to  130°-200°  : 

SiCl4  +  2Zn(Cnir2n+  t)2  =  2Zn(Jl„  +  Si(CnH2n  +  ,)«. 

When  the  reaction  is  completed  they  are  distilled  from  the  zincic 
chloride,  shaken  with  solution  of  potassic  hydrate  in  order  to  destroy 
any  organo-zinc  compound  or  silicic  chloride,  and  then  dried  by 
means  of  calcic  chloride  and  rectified. 

So  far  as  known  they  are  all  liquids  which  are  not  affected  by 
exposure  to  air. 

Silicon  tetramtthyl,  Si(CH3)4,  is  a  colourless,  mobile  liquid,  which 
boils  at  30°-31°,  floats  on  water,  and  at  higher  temperatures  bums 
with  a  clear  flame  and  formation  of  white  fumes  consisting  of  silicic 
anhydride.     Its  vapour  density  is  3*058. 

Si/Icon  tetrethyl,  Si(C2H5)4,  is  also  a  liquid  lighter  than  water, 
which  boils  at  153°.     The  vapour  density  is  5*13. 

Its  behaviour  with  chlorine  is  peculiar ;  this,  on  being  passed  into 
cooled  silicon  tetrethyl,  does  not  split  off  ethyl  groups,  but  replaces 
hydrogen  \  the  first  action  is  : 

Si(C2H5)4  +  Cl2  =  HC1  +  Si(C2H5)3(C2H4Cl). 

This  latter  body  is  a  liquid  boiling  at  185°.  It  corresponds  to  a 
nonylic  chloride,  C9H19C1  =  C(C2H5)3.C2H4C1,  and  is  therefore 
termed  silicononylic  chloride.  With  potassic  acetate  it  yields  pote 
chloride  and  silicononylic  acetate,  Si(C2H5)3(C2H4.O.C2H30),  which 
boils  at  about  212°,  and  by  heating  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  is 
saponified,  giving  silicononylic  alcohol,  Si(C2H5)3(C2H4.OH)  :

vided with  an  inverted  condenser,  covered  with  the  iodide,  and  the 
reaction  started  by  application  of  a  gentle  heat.  Once  commenced,  it 
proceeds  with  such  energy  that  the  flask  must  be  cooled  by  immersion 
in  water.  When  the  temperature  falls  the  reaction  is  completed  by 
heating. 

Different   compounds  are  obtained  according  to   the  amount  of 
sodium  in  the  alloy  and  to  the  proportion  of  the  different  ingredi' 
present. 

By  employment  of  an  alloy  very  poor  in  sodium,  and  an  exo 
ethylic   iodide,   stan-diethyl  diiodtde,    Bn(C|Hfi)aIa,  and  itan-triei 
iodide,  Sn(CsH8)8I,  are  mainly  formed,  the  latter  being  formed  in 
larger  quantity  the  larger  the  amount  of  sodium  in  the  alloy.      If  the 
amount  of  sodium  roaches  20  %  there  are  obtained  only  the 
radicals  diston-tetr ethyl,  Sn2(C2H-,N)l.  and  distan  hexethyl,  So 
These  bitter  are  extracted  from  the  mixed  products,  which  contain 
sodic  iodide  and  excess  of  zinc,  by  mean-  of  ether,  and  are 
mixed  together oo  evaporation  of  the  filtered  solution  in  an  atmo- 
sphere of  carbonic   anhydride.      They  can    be  I    by  means  of 
alcohol,    in   which   distan-hexet hyl    is   scarcely   soluble,  whilst    distan- 

■  hyl  is  readily  dissolved. 

On  distilling  the  reaction-mass  directly  from  the  sand  bath  the 
distan-hexethyl   pe  r    nearly   unaltered,   but    distan  tetrethyl 

decomposes  into  tin  and  Stan  tetrethyl,  which  volatilises.     The 
bodies  in  the  distillate  can  b  ionaJ  distillation. 


238       DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  ALCOHOL  RADICALS,   C„H2n+1. 

Pure  tin  in  the  shape  of  tin  filings  only  acts  on  ethylic  iodide  at 
high  temperatures  or  in  sunlight.  Stan-diethyl  diiodide  is  the  main 
product  : 

Sn  +  2C2H5I  =  Sn(C2H5)2I2. 

Stan-tetrethyl  is  most  conveniently  prepared  by  careful  mixing  of 
two  molecules  of  zinc  ethyl  with  one  molecule  of  stannic  chloride 
and  afterwards  distilling  : 

SnCl4  +  2Zn(C2H5)2  =  2ZnCl2  +  Sn(C2H5)4. 

The  halogen  compounds  of  the  radicals  poorer  in  ethyl  also  yield 
stan-tetrethyl  when  treated  with  zinc  ethyl : 

Sn(C2H5)2I2  +  Zn(C2H5)2  =  ZnI2  +  Sn(C2H5)4. 

350.  The  alcohol  radicals  united  to  tin  can  be  easily  replaced  one 
after  another  by  halogens.  If,  for  instance,  stan-tetrethyl  be  treated 
with  a  molecule  of  iodine,  it  yields  ethylic  iodide  and  stan-triethyl 
iodide  : 

Sn(C2H5)4  +  I,  =  C2H5I  +  Sn(C2H5)3I. 

This  by  more  iodine  is  converted  into  stan-diethyl  diiodide  : 

Sn(C2H5)3I  +  I2  =  C2H5I  +  Sn(C2H5)2I2. 

This  latter  on  heating  with  iodine  is  converted  into  stannic  iodide  : 

Sn(C2H5)2I2  +  2I2  =  2C2H5I  +  Snl4  ; 

but  so  far  attempts  to  prepare  a  stan-ethyl  triiodide  in  this  way  have 
not  met  with  success.  Hydrochloric  acid  converts  stan-tetrethyl  into 
stan-ethyl  chlorides  and  ethane  : 

Sn(C2H5)4  +  HC1  =  Sn(C2H5)3Cl  +  C2H6 
Sn(C2H5)3Cl  +  HC1  =  Sn(C2H5)2Cl2  +  C2H6.

351.  Stan-diethyl,  or  distan-tetrethyl,  Sn2(C2H5)4.  As  mentioned 
above,  distan-tetrethyl  is  separated  from  the  distan-hexethyl  formed  at 
the  same  time  by  means  of  alcohol ;  from  this  solution  it  is  pre- 
cipitated by  water  as  a  colourless,  thick,  oily  liquid  of  L558  sp.gr. 
From  the  air  it  absorbs  oxygen,  and  similarly  unites  with  the  halogens 
to  form  stan-diethyl  dihaloids  ;  e.g.

It  is  not  volatile  without  decomposition ;  on  heating  it  is  converted, 
with  separation  of  tin,  into  stan-tetrethyl,  which  distils  over  :

Stcm-diethyl  dichloride  is  best  prepared  by  dissolving  stan-diethyl

240       DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  ALCOHOL  RADICALS,   CnH2n+1. 

Stan-triethyl  chloride,  Sn(C2H5)3Cl,  is  obtained  most  readily  by 
action  of  hydrochloric  acid  on  the  oxide  (compare  §  350).  It  is  an 
oily  liquid,  boiling  at  209°,  of  sp.  gr.  1-428,  and  solidifying  in  crystals 
at  0°.     Its  vapour  acts  violently  on  the  mucous  membrane. 

Stan-triethyl  iodide,  Sn(C2H5)3I,  is  prepared  directly  by  aid  of  tin 
alloy  poor  in  sodium,  and  is  obtained  in  a  state  of  purity  by  the 
fractional  distillation  of  the  product.  It  is  a  colourless  oil  of  1  -85 
sp.  gr.,  boiling  at  231°.  It  is  miscible  in  all  proportions  with  alcohol 
and  ether. 

If  a  solution  of  the  halogen  compound  be  decomposed  by  argentic 
oxide  or  potassic  hydrate  and  distilled, 

Stan-triethyl  hydrate,  Sn(C2H5)3.OH,  passes  over  along  with  the 
water  vapour.  It  crystallises  in  brilliant  colourless  prisms,  which 
melt  at  43°  and  distil  at  272°.  It  sublimes  slowly  at  ordinary  tem- 
peratures. It  is  only  slightly  dissolved  by  water,  but  readily  by 
alcohol  and  ether.  It  reacts  strongly  alkaline,  and  absorbs  carbonic 
anhydride  from  the  air.  If  heated  for  a  long  time  to  near  its 
boiling  point  it  evolves  water  and  leaves  the  anhydride 

Stan-triethyl  oxide,  [Sn(C2H5)3]20  : 

2Sn(C2H5)3.OH  =  H20  +  [Sn(C2H5)3].0.[Sn(C2H5)3], 

which  by  action  of  water  again  yields  the  hydrate. 

The  salts  of  stan-triethyl  are  mostly  crystallisable,  and  can  be  pre- 
pared directly. 

The  sulphate,  [Sn(C2H5)3]2S04,  crystallises  in  brilliant  colourless 
prisms,  which  are  more  soluble  in  cold  than  in  boiling  water.  The 
nitrate,  Sn(G2H5)3.O.N02,  is  difficult  to  crystallise. 

If  stan-triethyl  iodide  be  heated  to  200°  with  dry  sodic  ethylate, 

Stan-triethyl  ethylate,  Sn(C2H5)3(OC2H5),  distils  over  as  a  colour- 
less, unpleasant-smelling  liquid,  of  1*2634  sp.  gr.  at  0°,  boiling  at 
190°-192°.     It  is  formed  according  to  the  equation  :

353.  Stan-tetrethyl,  Sn(C.2rI5)4.  The  method  of  preparation  and 
most  important  reactions  of  this  body  have  already  been  given.  It  is 
a  colourless  liquid  of  faint  ethereal  odour  and  somewhat  metallic 
taste,  boiling  at  181°.  Its  sp.  gr.  is  1-187  at  13°,  the  vapour  density 
8-021. 

354.  Several  of  the  methyl  compounds  of  tin  have  been  prepared ; 
they  resemble  the  corresponding  ethyl  compounds. 

Stan-tetramethyl  boils  at  78°,  has  at  0°  sp.  gr.  1-3138  and  a  vapour 
density  of  6"00.  Stan-trbnethyl  iodide,  Sn(CH3)3I,  is  liquid,  smells 
like  mustard  oil,  boils  at  170°,  and  has  sp.  gr.  2-1432  at  0°.  Treated 
with  sodium  it  does  not  yield  distan-hexm ethyl,  but  is  decomposed 
according  to  the  equation 

4Sn(CH3)I  +  2£Ta2  =  4NaI  +  Sn  +  3Sn(CH3)4. 

Stan-trimethyl  hydrate,  Sn(CH3)4.OH,  forms  colourless  prisms,

volatilises.  Treated  with  acid  it  gives  salts,  and  by  long  heating  the 
anhydrous  oxide  [Sn(CH3)3]20. 

Of  the  dimethyl  compounds  distan-tetramethyl  has  been  prepared, 
but  requires  further  investigation.  Stan-dimethyl  diiodide,  Sn(CH  -,) ,  I t , 
crystallises  in  prisms,  melting  at  22°,  boiling  at  228°,  and  pretty 
readily  soluble  in  water.  Ammonia  precipitates  from  it  amorphooi 
8tan-dimethyl  oxide,  insoluble  in  water,  soluble  in  potassio  bydraie, 
and  yielding  crystalline  salts  with  the  acids. 

Compounds  containing  both  ethyl  and  methyl  are  also  known. 
Their  formation  is  represented  by  the  equations  : 

Sn(C2H5)2Cl2  +  Zn(CH3)2  =  ZnCl2  +  Sn(C2H5)2(CH3)2 
and     2Sn(CH3)3Cl  +  Zn(C2H5)2  =  ZnCl2  +  2Sn(CH3)3(C2H5). 

355.  Of  normal  propyl  and  isobutyl  derivatives  there  have  been 
prepared  Sn(C3H7)3I  as  a  liquid  boiling  at  269°-270°,  and  Sn(C4H9)3I 
as  an  oil  boiling  at  292°-296°.  Stan-triisobutyl  hydrate  is  solid,  amor- 
phous, volatile,  and  of  strongly  alkaline  reaction. 

Lead  Compounds  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals. 

356.  In  most  of  its  inorganic  compounds  lead  acts  as  a  diad 
element,  but  in  its  compounds  with  the  alcohol  radicals,  as  far  as  they 
are  yet  known,  it  behaves  as  a  tetrad. 

The  compounds  Pb(CnH2n+i)4  are  prepared  by  action  of  alcoholic 
iodides  upon  an  alloy  of  lead  and  sodium,  or  better  by  treatment  of 
plumbic  chloride  with  organo-zinc  compounds,  followed  by  distillation. 
Probably  the  diad  compounds  or  the  double  molecule  of  the  latter  are 
first  formed  :

By  halogens  the  latter  are  converted  into  alkylic  haloids  and  mono-

357.  Lead  Methyl  Compounds. — On  adding  to  perfectly  dry 
plumbic  chloride,  contained  in  a  distillation  apparatus,  filled  with 
dried  carbonic  anhydride,  a  quantity  of  zinc  methyl  insufficient  for 
complete  decomposition,  metallic  lead  separates,  and  on  distillation 
plumb -tetramethyl,  Pb(CH3)4,  passes  over  as  a  colourless,  mobile  liquid, 
boiling  at  110°.  The  sp.  gr.  is  2*034  at  0°,  its  found  vapour  density 
at  130°  =  9*52  (theoretical  9'25).  It  is  insoluble  in  pure  water,  but 
readily  in  alcohol  and  ether  ;  it  is  not  affected  by  atmospheric  oxygen. 

If  plumbic  tetramethyl  be  boiled  for  some  time  with  hydrochloric 
acid  there  separates,  on  cooling,  long  silky  needles  of  plumb -trimethyl 
chloride,  Pb(CH3)301,  which  can,  when  dry,  be  sublimed  in  a  small 
glass  tube. 

By  the  decomposition  of  plumb-tetramethyl  by  careful  addition  of 
iodine,  plumb-trimethyl  iodide,  Pb(CH3)3I,  is  obtained  in  colourless 
needles,  little  soluble  in  water,  readily  in  boiling  alcohol.  If  this  be 
distilled  with  solid  potassic  hydrate,  an  oil  smelling  like  mustard 
passes  over,  which  solidifies  to  strongly  alkaline  prisms,  probably  of 
plumb-trimethyl  hydrate,  Pb(CH3)3.OH. 

358.  Lead  Ethyl  Compounds. — Plumb-tetrethyl,  Pb(C2H5)4,  is 
usually  prepared  by  decomposition  of  plumbic  chloride  with  zinc  ethyl, 
and  distillation  in  vacuo  of  the  liquid  poured  off  the  precipitated  lead.  It 
is  a  colourless  liquid  of  1  *62  sp.  gr.,  boiling  with  partial  decomposition 
at  above  200°.  When  heated  in  the  air  it  burns  with  an  orange- 
coloured,  green-mantled  flame.  Boiled  with  hydrochloric  acid,  it 
gives  plumb-triethyl  chloride,  Pb(C2H5)3Cl,  with  evolution  of  ethane, 
and  reacts  with  iodine  to  form  the  respective  iodides  : 

Pb(C2H5)4.+  I2  =  Pb(C2H5)3I  +  C2H5I. 

Both  haloid  compounds  crystallise  in  needles,  are  volatile,  and  smell 
like  mustard  oil.  When  distilled  with  solid  potassic  hydrate,  plumb- 
triethyl  hydrate,  Pb(C2H5)3.OH,  passes  over  as  an  oily,  strongly 
alkaline  liquid,  of  powerful  odour,  which  solidifies  on  cooling  to  a  mass 
of  interlaced  needles.  Plumb-triethyl  sulphate,  [Pb(C2H5)3]2S04, 
separates,  on  neutralisation  of  an  aqueous  solution  of  the  hydrate  with 
sulphuric  acid,  in  difficultly  soluble,  hard,  brilliant  octahedra. 

359.  Plumb-tetrisoamyl,  Pb(C5H11)4,  is  obtained,  by  action  of 
isoamylic  iodide  upon  lead-sodium  alloy,  extraction  of  the  product  with 
ether,  and  evaporation  of  the  filtered  solution,  as  a  yellow  oily  liquid 
which  cannot  be  distilled  unaltered.  Plumbic  triisoamyl  iodide, 
Pb(C5Hn)3I,  prepared  from  this,  crystallises  in  colourless  needles. 
The  hydrate  and  chloride  are  also  known. 

Aluminium  Compounds  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals. 

360.  On  heating  aluminium  filings  with  ethylic  iodide  in  sealed 
glass  tubes  to  130°-150°,  there  is  obtained  a  thick  liquid,  spon- 
taneously inflammable  in  air,  and  decomposed  by  water  with  explosive 
violence.  This  results  from  the  direct  union  of  the  metals  with  the 
components  of  the  ethylic  iodide,  and  without  doubt  has  the  composi- 
tion A12(C2H5)3I3.  Pure  aluminium  ethyl  cannot  be  obtained  by 
distillation  from  this,  the  liquid  distilling  over  invariably  containing 
some  iodine. 

Organo-aluminium  bodies  can  be  obtained  in  a  state  of  purity  by 


ALUMINIUM  AND  MERCURY   COMPOUNDS.  243 

digesting  the  corresponding  mercury  compounds  with  thin  aluminium 
ii.il,  this  method  serring  especially  for  the  preparation  of  the  methyl 
and  ethyl  compounds.  From  the  determinations  of  their  vapour 
densities  these  bodies  immediately  above  their  boiling  points  must  be 
expressed  by  the  formula  Al9(CnH2n+  ,),;,  being  analogous  to  that  of 
aluininic  chloride;  on  increasing  the  temperature,  however,  the  vapour 
density  decreases  and  approaches  to  nearly  half  its  former  value,  i.e. 
corresponds  to  the  molecular  formula  Al(CnH2n+1)I.  The  organo- 
aluminium  compounds  fume  in  the  air,  readily  iullame  spontaneously, 
and  then  bnrn  with  evolution  of  thick  fumes  of  alumina.  Water 
decomposes  them  with  explosive  violence  into  paraffins  and  aluminic 
hydrate : 

Al2(CnH2n  +  1)6  +  6H20  =  Al2(OH)6  +  6CnH2n  +  2. 

Aluminium  methyl,  A12(CH3)6  or  A1(CH3)3,  is  obtained  by  digest- 
ing mercury  dimethyl  with  aluminium  foil  and  then  distilling.  It  is 
liquid  at  ordinary  temperatures,  crystalline  at  0°,  and  boils  at  1 30°. 
Immediately  above  this  temperature  the  vapour  density  is  4*35,  at 
160°  only  3-9-4-1,  and  finally  at  240°  only  2-8.  The  theoretical 
density  for  A12(CH3)6  is  4-98  ;  for  A1(CH3)3,  2-49. 

Aluminium  ethyl,  A12(C2H5)6  or  A1(C2H5)3,  obtained  in  similar 
manner  to  the  methyl  compound,  is  still  liquid  at  —18°  and  boils  at 
194°.  At  230°  its  vapour  density  is  found  to  be  4*5.  The  vapour 
would  therefore  appear  to  be  a  mixture  of  a  little  Al2(C2Hr,)6  (theo- 
retical density  7*88)  with  much  A1(CH3)3  (theoretical  density  3-94). 

Mercury  Compounds  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals. 

361.  Mercury  forms  saturated  compounds  with  two  alcohol 
radicals,  Hg(CnH2n+ 1)2-  They  can  be  prepared  by  the  action  of 
organo-zinc  compounds  with  mercuric  chloride  : 

HgCl2  +  Zn(CnH2n+1)2  =  ZnCl2  +  Hg(CnH2n+  x)2; 

and  directly  by  the  action  of  sodium  amalgam,  diluted  with  much 
mercury  upon  the  alcoholic  iodides,  some  ethylic  acetate  being 
generally  also  added  : 

HgNa2  +  2ICnH2n+ ,  =  2NaI  +  Hg(CnH2n+  ,)., 

By  careful  addition  of  halogens  to  these  compounds  one  alcohol 
radical  is  removed  and  replaced  by  the  halogen : 

Hg(CnH,n+1)2  +  I2  =  Hg(CnH2n+1)I  +  CnH2n+1I  ; 

but  excess  of  halogen  converts  these  into  mercuric  haloids  : 

Bg(0ft|+1)I  +  I2  =  Hgl,  +  l\l1I2n+1.I. 

Halogen  hydro-acids  even  in  excess  only  cause  the  replacement  of  one 
alcohol  radical  : 

Hg(CnH2n+1)2+HCl  =  H-((.\lll,.ll.,,«  I    I   c„ll,n  +  2. 
The  oxy-acidfl  act  similarly  and  form  corresponding  salts.

2Hg(CnH2n  +  1)I  +  2KCN  =  2KI  +  Hg  +  C2N2  +  Hg(CnH2n+1)2. 

If  the  haloid  compounds  be  brought  into  contact  with  moist  argentic 
oxide,  the  caustic  basic  hydrates  are  formed  : 

Hg<C?H2n  +  1  +  Ag°H  =  ASC1  +  HS<OnH  2n  +  1 

which  yield  salts  with  acids.  All  these  compounds  are  extremely 
poisonous,  especially  when  the  vapours  of  the  volatile  ones  are  breathed. 
Strong  dilution  with  air  does  not  prevent  this  action,  long  breathing 
of  such  a  mixture  producing  chronic  poisoning  of  the  most  fearful 
description. 

No  compounds  of  mercury  with  alcohol  radicals  of  the  formula 
Hg2(CnH2n  +  1)2,  corresponding  to  mercurous  chloride,  have  been 
obtained. 

362.  Methyl  Compounds. — In  order  to  prepare  mercury  dimethyl 
one  per  cent,  sodium  amalgam  is  slowly  added  with  constant  shaking 
to  a  mixture  of  methylic  iodide  with  one-tenth  of  its  volume  of  ethylic 
acetate.  The  mixture  becomes  hot,  while  mercury  and  sodic  iodide 
separate.  If  the  proportion  of  the  latter  becomes  so  large  that  the 
liquid  becomes  pulpy,  all  volatile  matters  must  be  distilled  off  and 
treated  anew  with  sodium  amalgam.  This  treatment  is  continued 
until  one  atom  of  sodium  has  been  added  for  every  molecule  of 
methylic  iodide,  and  a  small  quantity  of  the  liquid  no  longer  yields 
iodine  on  boiling  with  nitric  acid.  The  distillate,  after  addition  of 
water,  is  shaken  with  potassic  hydrate  to  remove  ethylic  acetate,  and 
the  separated  heavy  oil  dried  by  calcic  chloride  and  rectified. 

PIT 

Mercury  dimethyl,  Hg<^pTT3,  is  a  colourless  refractive  liquid  not 

miscible  with  water,  boiling  at  95°,  and  has  sp.  gr.  3*069  at  ordinary 
temperatures.  It  has  a  faint,  somewhat  sweet  odour,  does  not  alter 
in  air,  is,  however,  readily  inflammable,  and  burns  with  a  luminous 
flame  with  evolution  of  mercury  vapours.  It  dissolves  caoutchouc, 
resin,  and  phosphorus. 

OTT 

Mercury  methyl-iodide,  Hg<\-     3,  is  prepared  from  the  preceding 

by  addition  of  iodine  to  its  aqueous  solution.  It  separates  in  crystals, 
and  is  obtained  pure  on  recrystallisation  from  hot  alcohol  in  white 
nacreous  plates.  It  melts  at  143°,  sublimes  readily,  is  insoluble  in 
water,  but  is  readily  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether. 

PIT 

Mercury  methyl-chloride,    Hg<^pj   3,    completely   resembles    the 

iodide. 

An  alcoholic  solution  of  the  iodide  gives,  on  addition  of  argentic 
nitrate,  a  precipitate  of  argentic  iodide,  and  the  filtrate  on  evapora- 
tion in  vacuo  yields  colourless,  transparent  prisms  of  mercury  methyl- 
nitrate  : 

£H°  +  AgO.N02  =  Agl  +Hg<<^02 

readily   soluble   in  water,    but  difficultly  in   alcohol.      It   melts  at

100°,  and  on  cooling  becomes  crystalline  again.  From  its  aqueous 
solution  metallic  chlorides  precipitate  mercury  ethyl-chloride  ;  alkalies 
produce  no  precipitate. 

363.  Ethyl  Compounds. — Mercury  diethyl,  Hg(C2H5)2,  is  prepared 
like  the  methyl  compound,  and  shows  similar  properties.  It  is  a 
liquid  of  sp.  gr.  2*44  and  boiling  at  159°.  The  vapour  density  is 
997.     At  200°  its  vapour  decomposes  into  mercury  and  butane. 

G  TT 
Mercury  ethyl-chloride,  Hg<^?     5,  prepared,  amongst  other  me- 
thods, by  mixing  solutions  of  mercury  diethyl  and  mercuric  chloride  :

Mercury  ethyl-iodide,  Hg<%- 2     5,    obtained    from    mercury    and

posed into  mercury  and  butane  (together  with  some  ethane  and 
ethylene). 

By  treatment  of  the  haloid  compounds  with  moist  argentic  oxide, 

P  TT 

mercury  ethyl-hydrate,  Hg<^Q|r  5,  goes  into  solution,  and  is  left  on 

evaporation  as  a  strongly  caustic  alkaline  liquid,  which  precipitates 
most  metals  from  their  salts  as  hydrates  and  yields  crystalline  salts 
with  acids. 

364.  Mercury  dipropyl,  Hg(CH2.CH2.CH3)2,  boils  at  189°-191° 
and  has  sp.  gr.  2-124  at  16°. 

Mercury  diisobutyl,  Hg(C4H9)2,  distils  between  205°-207°;  sp.  gr. 
1-835  at  15°. 

Mercury  diisoamyl,  Hg^H!  ^2,  is  readily  obtained  from  a  mixture 
of  isoamylic  iodide,  acetic  ether,  and  sodium  amalgam.  It  is  a 
colourless  liquid,  cannot  be  distilled  unchanged,  is  insoluble  in  water, 
has  sp.  gr.  1*66,  and  gives  with  iodine  crystalline  plates  of  mercury 
isoamyl  iodide,  Hg(C5Hn)I. 

Zinc  Compounds  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals. 

365.  On  submitting  granulated  zinc  for  a  long  time  to  the  action 
of  alkylic  iodides  with  exposure  to  light,  then,  as  with  other  metals, 
bodies  of  the  formula  Zn(CnH2n+1)I  result.  The  same  change  occurs 
on  heating,  only  goes  further,  so  that  in  sealed  tubes  zinc  and  paraffins 
(as  di-radicals)  are  formed  (§  150),  some  zinc  compound  of  the  alcohol 
radical  being  formed  at  the  same  time.  The  zinc  compound  is  ob- 
tained in  larger  quantity  when  anhydrous  ether  is  mixed  with  the 
alkylic  iodide  and  the  mixture  heated  with  zinc  in  sealed  tubes  to 
130°-150°. 

After  cooling  the  tube  is  carefully  opened,  when  gaseous  products 
(paraffins,  &c.)  escape.  By  gentle  warming  the  ether  is  expelled,  and 
the  residue,  consisting  mainly  of  the  iodo-zinc  compound,  distilled  in  a 
stream  of  carbonic  anhydride,  decomposition  occurring  as  shown  by  the 
equation  : 

2Zn(CnH2n+1)I  =  Znl2  +  Zn(CnH2n+1)2. 

Organo-zinc  compounds  may  also  be  obtained  by  heating  the  alkyl

haloid  with  granulated  zinc  or  zinc  filings  in  presence  of  a  small 
quantity  of  iodine,  the  apparatus  employed  resembling  that  next  de- 
scribed. 

The  organo-zinc  compounds  are  also  obtained  by  employment  of  an 
alloy  of  zinc  and  sodium.  To  prepare  this,  zinc  is  heated  in  a  Hessian 
crucible  until  it  volatilises  freely,  and  one-fourth  of  its  weight  of  sodium 
stirred  in.  After  the  combination  of  the  metals  the  crucible  is  re- 
moved from  the  fire,  filled  with  dry  sand  to  prevent  contact  with  air, 
and  then  cooled.  When  cold,  the  crucible  is  broken,  and  any  sodium 
adhering  to  the  regulus  cut  off,  and  the  last  traces  removed  by  treat- 
ment with  water.  The  well-dried  metallic  mass  is  then  coarsely 
powdered  and  preserved  in  well-stoppered  glass  vessels. 

Fig.  19. 


The  alloy  is  placed  in  the  flask  A  (fig.  19),  heated  by  a  water  bath,  and 
warmed  for  a  long  time  with  an  equal  weight  of  the  alky  lie  iodide.  The 
flask  is  connected  with  an  inverted  condenser  b,  in  which  the  evolved 
vapours  are  condensed  and  flow  back  into  the  flask.  The  condenser 
tube  has  at  its  upper  end  a  small  set  of  bulbs  c,  in  whose  bend  a  small 
quantity  of  mercury  prevents  access  of  air  whilst  allowing  the  escape 
of  any  gas  evolved.  Previous  to  heating  the  ingredients  the  whole 
apparatus  is  filled  with  carbonic  anhydride  by  means  of  the  tapped 
tube  a,  and  the  tap  then  closed. 

After  completion  of  the  reaction  the  flask  is  connected  with  a 
condenser  placed  in  the  usual  way,  whose  lower  end  is  connected  with 


ZINC   COMPOUNDS.  247 

a  receiver  provided  with  a  mercury  valve  similar  to  that  above 
described.  The  zinc  compound  in  the  flask  formed  according  to  the 
equation  : 

ZnNa2  +  2ICnH2n+1  =  2NaI  +  Zn(CnH2n+1)2, 

is  then  distilled,  a  current  of  dry  carbonic  anhydride  passing  through 
the  tube  a. 

Finally,  the  organo-zinc  compounds  are  obtained  by  heating  the  cor- 
responding mercury  compounds  with  zinc  filings  to  100°-130°.  The 
separated  mercury  amalgamates  with  the  excess  of  zinc  : 

Hg(CnH2n+1)2  +  Zn2  =  HgZn  +  Zn(CnH2n+1)2. 

The  product  is  then  distilled  in  a  stream  of  carbonic  anhydride. 

366.  The  zinc  organo  compounds  are  colourless,  peculiarly  smelling 
bodies,  which  oxidise  in  air  with  evolution  of  fumes  and  mostly  with 
spontaneous  inflammation.  They  burn  with  a  bluish  green  flame  and 
formation  of  thick  fumes  of  zincic  oxide.  If  the  oxidation  be  mode- 
rated by  allowing  the  ethereal  solutions  to  remain  in  imperfectly  closed 
vessels,  two  oxidation  products  are  formed  by  the  oxygen  atoms 
placing  themselves  between  the  zinc  and  the  alcohol  radical — namely, 
first  according  to  the  equation  : 

2Zn<^2n+1  +  02  =  2Zn<^'^?H2n+1 
and  on  further  oxidation  : 

2Zn<°  ^H2n+i  +  02  =  2Zn<°  ^H2n+1 

The  latter  compounds  decompose  on  contact  with  water  into  alcohols 
and  zincic  hydrate  : 

Zn(O.CnH2n+1)a  +  2H20  =  Zn(OH)2  +  2HO.CnH2n+1. 

The  unoxidised  compounds  also  react  on  water  with  explosive  violence, 
yielding  paraffins  (hydrides  of  the  alcohol  radicals)  (§  149)  : 

Zn(CnH2n+1)2  +  2HOH  =  Zn(OH)2  +  20nH2n  +  2. 

Like  oxygen,  sulphur  unites  directly  with  them,  forming  zinc  mer- 
captides  : 

Zn<Sn52n+1  +  2S  =  Zn<^n^2n  +  1 

W112n  +  1  fc-^n-t^n  +  l 

With  the  haloid  compounds  of  the  alcohol  radicals  they  give, 
especially  on  heating,  zinc  haloids  and  paraffins  (di-radicals)  (§  150)  : 

^n!42n+  ! 

Zn(CnH2n+  O2  +  2Cn,H2n,+  ,1  =  Znl2  +  2  | 

^n'142n'+  1 

Free  halogens  yield,  by  a  very  violent  reaction,  zinc  haloids  and  alkylic 
haloids : 

Zn(CnH2n+1)2  +  2Br2  =  ZnBr2  +  2CnH2n+1Br. 

Their  employment  in  the  preparation  of  tertiary  phosphines  (§  297) 
of  organo-metallic  bodies,  and  of  tertiary  alcohols  (§  163),  has 
already  been  mentioned. 

Ethereal  solutions  of  these  zinc   compounds  absorb   sulphurous

peculiar  acids,  of  which  the  sulphur  acids  have  already  (§  252) 
been  noticed.

367.  Zinc  methyl,  zinc  dimethyl,  Zn^p^r3,  is   usually  prepared 

by  heating  mercury  dimethyl  with  zinc,  further  by  heating  methylic 
iodide  with  zinc-sodium  alloy  or  with  powdered  zinc  in  sealed  glass 
tubes  at  100°.  It  is  a  colourless,  strongly  refractive,  extremely  un- 
pleasant smelling  liquid,  of  sp.  gr.  1'386  at  10*5°,  which  boils  at  46°. 
Mixed  with  ethylic  ether,  it  yields  between  51°  and  57°  a  liquid  which 
cannot  be  separated  by  fractional  distillation  and  whose  proportional 
composition  is  represented  by  the  formula  2Zn(CH3)2,(C2H5)20. 

On  addition  of  some  methylic  alcohol  to  zinc  methyl  there  is 
formed,  according  to  the  equation 

zii<8h3 + hoch* = ch< + zn<8?H3 

Zinc  methyl-methylate  as  a  white,  spongy,  somewhat  crystalline 
mass.  If  excess  of  methylic  alcohol  be  employed,  solid  zinc  dimethy- 
late  is  obtained.     Zinc  methyl  inflames  in  air. 

368.  Zinc  ethyl,  zinc  diethyl,  Zn(C2H5)2,  completely  resembles 
the  methyl  compound,  has  sp.  gr.  1*182,  boils  at  118°,  and  has  a 
vapour  density  of  4*26.  In  ethereal  solution  it  absorbs  two  molecules 
of  nitric  oxide  gas,  and  yields  large  colourless  crystals,  in  which  one- 
half  of  the  ethyl  is  still  united  with  zinc  : 

Zn(C2H5)2  +  N202  =  C2H5.N202.(ZnC2H5). 

The  action  of  water  causes  ethane  to  be  evolved,  whilst  the  basic 
zinc  salt  of  dinitro-ethylic  acid  results  : 

C2H5lSr202(ZnC2H5)  +  H20  =  C2H6  +  C2H5N202(Zn.OH), 

from  whose  solution  one-half  of  the  zinc  can  be  precipitated  by  means 
of  carbonic  anhydride  : 

2C2H5.N202.Zn.OH  +  C02  =  ZnC03  +  H20  +  (C2H5N202)2Zn. 

From  the  soluble  neutral  zinc  salt,  other  salts  of  dinitro-ethylic 
acid  can  be  prepared  by  double  decomposition  : 

(C2H5N202)2Zn  +  Na,C03  =  ZnC03  +  2C2H5N202.^Ta. 

They  are  all  difficultly  crystallisable,  and  when  heated  in  the  dry  state 
explode  violently.  By  treatment  of  dinitro-ethylic  acid  or  its  salt 
with  nascent  hydrogen,  equal  molecules  of  ethylamine  and  ammonia 
are  obtained : 

C2H5N202H  +  8H  =  C2H5.NH2  +  NH3  +  2H20. 

Therefore  the  constitution  of  the  acid  is  best  expressed  by  the 
formula  : 

0

C2H5.N— 0— N.OH  or  C2H5.N— N.OH. 

369.  Zinc  dijyropyl,  Zn(CH2.CH2.CH3)2,  boils  at  146°  and  is 
spontaneously  inflammable. 


MAGNESIUM  COMPOUNDS.  249 

Zinc  diisobutyl,  Zn(C4H9)2,  boils  between  185°  and  188°. 
Zinc  diisoamyl,  Zn(C5Hn)2,  is  liquid,  has  sp.  gr.  1*022,  boils  at 
220°,  and  fumes  in  the  air  without  inflaming  spontaneously. 


Other  Metallic  Compounds  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals. 

370.  Magnesium  diethyl,  Mg.(C2H5)2,  is  obtained  as  a  volatile 
liquid,  .smelling  like  garlic,  when  magnesium  filings  are  digested  with 
ethylic  iodide  in  absence  of  air.  There  is  first  formed  solid  magnesium 
ethyl  iodide : 

Mg  +  C2H5I  =  Mg<£aH* 

which  on  strong  heating  in  vessels  filled  with  carbonic  anhydride 
leaves  a  residue  of  magnesic  iodide,  whilst  liquid  magnesium  diethyl 
distils  over. 

Maynesium  diethyl  inflames  spontaneously  in  air,  and  is  decom- 
posed with  explosive  violence  by  water  into  magnesic  hydrate  and 
ethane.  Magnesium  dimethyl  is  entirely  similar  in  preparation  and 
properties. 

371.  Compounds  of  the  alkali  metals  with  the  alcohol  radicals 
cannot  be  obtained  in  the  isolated  state  ;  they  are  undoubtedly  formed 
by  the  action  of  sodium  or  potassium  on  organo-zinc  compounds, 
zinc  being  separated  even  at  ordinary  temperatures  : 

Zn(C2H5)2  +  Na2  =  Zn  +  2NaC2H5. 

The  resulting  liquid  crystallises  at  low  temperatures,  but  invariably 
contains  much  unaltered  zinc  compound,  and  is  at  once  converted  by 
water  into  ethane,  zincic  hydrate,  and  sodic  hydrate : 

NaC2H5  +  H20  =  NaOH  +  C2H6. 

- 
Sodium  ethyl,  when  mixed  with  ethylic  iodide,  yields  sodic  iodide 
at  ordinary  temperatures,  but  does  not  give  diethyl  (butane),  but  a 
mixture  of  ethylene  and  ethane  : 

£TaC2H5  +  IC2H5  «  Nal  +  C2H6  +  C2H4. 

372.  Compounds  of  thallium  and  tungsten  with  ethyl  are  also 
known,  but  the  metals  are  not  united  by  all  their  bonds  to  ethyl,  but 
in  part  also  to  negative  elements.  Amongst  such  bodies  are  chloride, 
nitrate,  and  sulphate  of  the  strongly  positive  monacid  radical  thallium 
diethyl,  T1(C2H5)2C1,  Tl(C2H,)2.O.N02,  [T1(C2H5)2]2S04,  Ac.  Tung- 
sten gives  with  methylic  iodide  tungsten  trimetbyl  iodide,  W(CH3)3I, 
crystallising  in  colourless  tables.

DISUBSTITUTION  PRODUCTS  OF  THE  PARAFFINS. 

Derivatives  of  the  Diad  Radicals,  CnH2n. 

373.  The  replacement  of  two  of  the  hydrogen  atoms  of  a  paraffin 
by  other  elements  yields  compounds  of  the  diad  hydrocarbon  nucleus 
CnH2n.  It  has  already  been  pointed  out  (§  143)  that  three  different 
groups  are  thereby  formed,  which  are  named  respectively  after  their 
simplest  oxygen  compounds. 

374.  1.  Aldehyde  Derivatives. — In  these  the  substitution  has 
taken  place  on  a  single,  terminal  carbon  atom  of  the  nucleus.  The 
simplest  oxides  are  the  aldehydes  : 

CO 

I 

OH 

the  first  oxidation  products  of  the  primary  monacid  alcohols  (§  160). 
The  names  of  their  hydrocarbon  radicals,  CnH2n+1.CH,  are  derived 
from  those  of  the  radicals  CnH2n  +  1  by  addition  of  the  terminal 
disyllable  '  idene.'  Thus  from  ethyl,  CH3.CH2,  there  is  formed 
ethyl-idene,  CH3.CH.  The  general  name  alkyl-idenes  is  applied  to 
the  whole  group. 

375.  2.  Ketone  derivatives  result  when  both  substitution  positions 
are  on  one  and  the  same  intermediate  carbon  atom.     The  oxides 

CnH2n  + 1 
CO 

I 

CnH2n+  j 

are  termed  ketones,  and  are  formed  by  oxidation  of  secondary  alcohols 
(§160). 

376.  3.  Glycol  derivatives  are  obtained  by  substitution  of  hydrogen 
atoms  united  to  different  carbon  atoms.  In  the  glycols  or  diacid 
alcohols  they  are  replaced  by  OH.  The  first  member  of  the  series  is 
a  dicarbonide 

CH2.OH 

CH2.OH 
a  diprimary  alcohol.     With  greater  carbon  contents  there  occur  in

If  the  substitution  positions  are  on  neighbouring  carbon  atoms  the 
free  radicals  can — by  double  union  of  the  two  carbon  atoms — occur  as 
free  molecules.  These  are  the  hydrocarbons  of  the  formula  CnH2n, 
whose  names  are  derived  from  those  of  the  alcohol  radicals  by  affixing 
the  terminal  syllable  '  ene ; '  as  CH2 :  CH2,  ethylene  ;  CH3.CH :  CH2, 
propylene,  &c. 

377.  In  all  three  categories  the  diad  radicals,  CnH2n,  can  be  united 
with  two  dissimilar  monad  elements  or  radicals.  There  thereby 
result  complications  which  do  not  occur  in  the  compounds  of  the 
monad  alcohol  radicals.  There  is,  for  instance,  a  chloro-hydrate, 
C2H4.C1(0H),  between  the  chloride,  C2H4C12,  and  the  hydrate, 
C2H4(OH)2.  Notwithstanding  the  numerous  theoretical  possibilities, 
the  number  of  compounds  of  the  diad  radicals,  CnH2n,  actually  known, 
is  far  smaller  than  that  of  the  alcohol  radical  compounds. 

Aldehyde  Derivatives. 
Compounds  of  the  Alkylidene  Radicals,  CnH2n+1.CH  :. 

378.  In  the  aldehyde  derivatives  two  of  the  hydrogen  atoms  of  a 
single  primarily  united  carbon  atom  of  a  paraffin  have  been  replaced 
by  other  elements  or  compound  radicals. 

Halogen  Compounds  of  the  Aldehyde  Radicals. 

379.  Of  the  halogen  compounds  of  the  aldehyde  radicals  several 
chlorides,  CmH2m+ j.CHCl2,  and  bromides  are  known,  but  only  a 
single  iodide. 

The  chlorine  compounds  can  be  prepared  directly  from  the 
paraffins  and  their  primary  monochlor  derivatives.  The  replace- 
ment of  a  second  atom  of  hydrogen  by  chlorine  occurs  mainly  in  the 
immediate  neighbourhood  of  the  chlorine  atom  originally  present : 

On'H2n'+i  CnJI2n'+1 

I  +  Cl2  =  HC1  +     I 

CH2.C1  CHC12 

but  other  products — especially  olefine  dichlorides — are  always  formed. 
In  working  with  ethylic  chloride,  for  instance,  the  reaction  occurs  to 
a  much  greater  extent  according  to  the  equation  : 

CH3  CH3 

I  +  Cl2  =  I  +  HC1,

CH2.C1  CH2.C1 

Another  method  of  preparation  of  these  compounds  consists  in  bring- 
ing the  respective  aldehydes  into  reaction  with  phosphoric  penta- 
chloride :

and  separating  the  products  by  fractional  distillation  or  by  converting 
the  phosphoric  oxychloride  into  phosphoric  acid  by  addition  of  water, 
separating  the  oily  chloride  from  the  aqueous  solution,  and  rectifying 
it  alone. 

380.  Methene  Haloids. — Methene  dichloride,  CH2C12,  is  formed  by 
the  action  of  chlorine  on  methylic  chloride  : 

CH3CI  +  Cl2  =  HC1  +  CH2C12, 

and  is  therefore  the  second  chlorine  substitution  product  of  methane, 
dichlor  methane.  It  is  more  commonly  prepared  by  placing  methylic 
iodide  in  a  retort,  covering  with  water,  and  then  passing  chlorine 
through  the  tubulus  into  the  liquid.  The  very  volatile  methene  di- 
chloride collects  in  the  receiver,  which  must  be  kept  well  cooled, 
whilst  iodine  is  left  in  the  retort  : 

2CH3I  +  3C12  =  2CH2C12  +  I2  +  2HC1. 

After  drying  over  calcic  chloride  and  rectifying,  methene  dichloride  is 
a  colourless  liquid  of  sweet,  penetrating  odour,  nearly  insoluble  in 
water,  boiling  at  41°,  and  having  sp.  gr.  1-344. 

The  same  method  may  be  applied  to  the  formation  of  methene  di- 
bromide,  according  to  the  equation  : 

2CH3I  +  3Br2  =  2CH2Br2  +  2HBr  +  I2- 

It  forms  a  heavy  liquid,  boiling  at  80°-82°  and  of  sp.  gr.  2*084  at 
11-5°. 

Methene  diiodide,  CH2I2,  is  a  colourless,  sweet-smelling  oil  of  sp. 
gr.  3*345,  which  boils  at  182°  and  solidifies  in  the  cold  to  brilliant 
leafy  crystals,  melting  at  +  6°.  The  vapour  density  is  9*55.  It  is 
insoluble  in  water  and  will  not  moisten  glass. 

It  is  obtained  by  distilling  iodoform  with  an  alcoholic  solution  of 
potassic  hydrate,  the  alcohol  being  converted  into  various  oxidation 
products  by  the  oxygen  evolved  : 

CHI3  +  KOH  +  KI  +  CH2T2  +  0; 

also  by  heating  iodoform  for  several  hours  with  the  most  concentrated 
aqueous  hydriodic  acid  at  125°-150°  : 

CHI3  +  HI  =  CH2I2  +  I2; 
by  heating  chloroform  with  hydriodic  acid  : 

CHCI3  +  4HI  +  CH2I2  +  I2  +  3HC1; 
(compare  §  149);  or  by  heating  iodoform  alone  in  sealed  tubes  to  150°,

381.  Ethylidene  Haloid  Compounds. — Ethylidene  dichloride  : 

C2H4C12  or  CH3.CHC12, 

is  obtained  by  the  action  of  chlorine  gas  when  exposed  to  light  on 
ethylic  chloride,  together  with  ethylene  dichloride  and  further  sub- 
stitution products  (§  377),  from  which  it  must  be  separated  by  frac- 
tional distillation.  It  is  also  formed  by  the  action  of  phosphoric 
chloride  on  ethylic  aldehyde  :

and  is  a  colourless  liquid  of  chloroform -like  odour,  1'198  sp.  gr.,  and 
58°-59°  boiling  point,  which  is  insoluble  in  water. 

Ethylidene  dibromide,  CH3.CHBr2,  is  formed  by  conducting  the 
vapour  of  ethylic  aldehyde  into  phosphoric  bromide,  a  liquid  being 
obtained  which  contains  ethylidene  dibromide  and  phosphoric  oxy- 
bromide ;  on  addition  of  ice  the  latter  is  converted  into  phosphoric 
acid  and  hydrobromic  acid,  from  which  the  ethylidene  dibromide 
separates  as  a  yellowish  oil.  It  is  also  obtained  by  the  action  of 
bromine  upon  ethylic  bromide  : 

CH3.CH2Br  +  Br2  =  CH3.CHBr2  +  HBr, 

and  is  separated  from  other  products  formed  at  the  same  time  by 
fractional  distillation.  It  boils  at  114°.  It  is  very  readily  decom- 
posed, water  on  gentle  heating  yielding  with  it  hydrobromic  acid 
and  probably  aldehyde. 

382.  Propylidene  dichloride,  CH3.CH2.CHC12,  obtained  from  pro- 
pylic  aldehyde  and  phosphoric  chloride,  is  a  liquid  boiling  at  84°-87°, 
of  onion-like  odour. 

Isoamylidene  dichloride,  (CH3)2CH.CH2.CIIC12,  is  obtained  from 
isoamylic  aldehyde,  by  means  of  phosphoric  chloride,  as  an  oil  boiling  at 
130°  and  of  sp.  gr.  1-05  at  24°. 

Oxygen  Compounds  of  the  Aldehyde  Radicals. 

383.  As  already  mentioned,  the  anhydrous  oxides  of  the  aldehyde

sponding  to  these  oxides,    |  ,  cannot  be  obtained  in  a  state  of

purity,  although  they  probably  exist  in  aqueous  solution.    On  mixing 
an  aldehyde  with  water,  heat  is  generally  evolved  and  a  diminution 
of  volume  observed,  probably  in  consequence  of  union  with  the  elements 
of  water  :

and  aldehyde.  It  appears  that  the  grouping  of  several  hydroxyl 
groups  round  a  single  carbon  atom  is  invariably  accompanied  with 
but  small  intensity  of  union  and  with  a  strong  tendency  to  decompose 
into  water  and  anhydride.  But  these  polyhydrates  become  much 
more  stable  when  carbon  groups  rich  in  negative  elements  are  in  com- 
bination also.  If  ethyl  aldehyde,  CH3.CHO,  be  converted  into 
chloral,  CCl3.CHO,  the  latter  yields  with  water  chloral  hydrate, 
CC13.CH(0H)2,  a  very  stable  body. 

As  two  oxynuclei  can  be  united  at  the  same  time  to  an  aldehyde 
radical,  oxides  and  salts  occur  of  the  general  formula  : 

OmH2m+ 1 

CH(OR)2 
in  which  R  is  the  radical  either  of  an  alcohol  or  an  acid. 

The  Aldehydes. 

384.  The  aldehydes  are  generally  prepared  by  the  moderated 
action  of  ozone  or  oxidising  agents  upon  primary  alcohols  or  their 
ethers.  One  atom  of  oxygen  then  removes  from  the  primary  alcohol 
two  atoms  of  hydrogen  in  the  form  of  water  (therefore  the  name 
aldehyde,  abbreviated  from  alcohol  dehydrogenatum).  One  of  these 
hydrogen  atoms  is  from  the  hydroxyl  group,  the  second  from  one  of 
the  hydrogen  atoms  united  to  the  same  carbon  atom  : 


l/H  I  /H

More  probably  the  first  action  is  the  direct  union  of  the  oxygen  so 
as  to  form  a  second  hydroxyl  group  : 

C<-H      +  0  =  C<-0— H

which  then  decomposes  into  water  and  aldehyde  :

385.  The  aldehydes  can  be  obtained  from  the  haloid  compounds  of

and  then  saponifying.  In  this  latter  decomposition  the  alkali  must 
not  be  employed  in  excess,  as  it  very  readily  converts  the  aldehydes 
into  resinous  products,  whose  nature  has  not  yet  been  sufficiently 
made  out. 

386.  A  further  method  for  the  formation  of  the  aldehydes  of 
general  application,  is  from  those  acids  which  the  aldehydes  themselves 
yield  when  oxidised.  If  the  calcic  salt  of  such  an  acid  be  intimately 
mixed  with  calcic  formate  and  the  mixture  submitted  to  dry  distil- 
lation, calcic  carbonate  remains  behind,  whilst  the  aldehyde  distils 
over :

The  aldehydes  appear  also  to  be  formed  without  exception  by  the 
action  of  sodium  amalgam  upon  a  mixture  of  the  acid  with  the  acid 
anhydride  or  acid  chloride.  These  decompositions  probably  occur  as 
in  the  following  equations  :

387.  The  aldehydes  are  generally  characterised  by  the  ease  of  their 
conversion  into  polymeric  modifications,  especially  yielding  tripled 
molecules.  Their  formation  may  be  explained  on  the  supposition 
that  the  oxygen  atoms  of  the  aldehydes  unite  on  polymerisation  to 
the  carbon  atoms  of  two  molecules,  thereby  joining  the  molecules 
together.    This  may  be  shown  by  the  formula  :

On  heating  to  higher  temperatures  these  polymerised  aldehydes 
split  up  again  into  the  simple  molecules. 

388.  The  aldehydes,  as  the  compounds  intermediate  between  the 
primary  alcohols  and  acids,  can  readily  be  converted  into  either. 

By  treatment  with  nascent  hydrogen — by  sufficiently  energetic 
action  of  sodium  amalgam  upon  a  slightly  acidulated  aqueous  solution 
of  aldehyde — two  atoms  of  hydrogen  are  combined,  and  the  primary 
alcohol  regenerated,  from  which  the  aldehyde  can  be  obtained  by 
oxidation :

The  aldehydes  are  slowly  converted  into  acids  by  mere  exposure  to 
atmospheric  oxygen,  and  this  change  occurs  considerably  more  quickly 
with  oxidising  agents :

The  action  of  argentic  oxide  is  especially  characteristic.  By  adding 
ammonia  to  argentic  nitrate  until  the  argentic  oxide  first  precipitated 
is  redissolved,  a  liquid  is  obtained  which,  when  added  to  aldehyde  at 
ordinary  temperatures,  but  more  quickly  on  warming,  gives  a  deposit 
of  metallic  silver,  whilst  the  amnionic  salt  of  the  acid  remains  in 
solution : 

0=0  +  2NH3AgOH  =  O=0         +  Ag2  +  H20  +  NH3.

If  the  aldehyde  is  miscible  with  water  the  silver  separates  in 
great  part  as  a  coherent,  mirror-like  film  on  the  sides  of  the  vessel.  If 
an  aldehyde  be  brought  into  contact  with  freshly  precipitated  argentic 
oxide,  the  argentic  salt  of  the  acid  is  formed  : 

CmH2m+1.OO.H  +  3AgOH  =  CmH2m+1.CO.OAg  +  Ag2  +  2H20. 

In  detecting  or  purifying  aldehydes  use  is  made  of  their  com- 
binations with  the  alkaline  hydric  sulphites  and  with  ammonia  (see 
later). 

By  action  of  phosphoric  chloride  the  aldehydes  and  their  polymers 
are  converted  into  the  dichlorides  of  the  radicals  (§  379). 

Formic  Aldehyde,  or  Methene  Oxide,  CH20. 

389.  Methene  oxide,  methylic  aldehyde,  also  known  (as  the  aldehyde 
of  formic  acid)  as  formic  aldehyde,  is  only  known  in  the  state  of 
vapour  and  in  aqueous  solution,  which  probably  contains  it  as  a  di- 
hydrate.     In  absence  of  water  it  polymerises  with  great  readiness. 


FOKMIC  ALDEHYDE.  257 

The  aqueous  solution  of  formic  aldehyde  is  most  readily  obtained 
by  oxidation  of  methylic  alcohol.  For  this  purpose  some  methylic 
alcohol  is  placed  on  the  bottom  of  a  tri-tubulated  WoulfFs  bottle.  In 
one  of  the  side  necks  a  glass  tube  open  at  both  ends  is  placed  so  as  to 
dip  into  the  methylic  alcohol,  whilst  the  other  is  connected  with  a 
condenser,  this  with  a  receiver,  and  this  latter  attached  air-tight  to  a 
powerful  aspirator.  The  condenser  is  filled  with  ice-cold  water,  with 
which  the  receiver  is  also  surrounded.  When  the  aspirator  has  been 
set  working,  the  middle  neck  of  the  WoulfFs  bottle  is  closed  with  a 
stopper,  from  which  hangs  a  spiral  of  platinum  wire  which  has  been 
heated  to  glowing.  A  powerful  stream  of  air  is  now  drawn  through 
the  open  tube,  which  bubbling  through  the  methylic  alcohol  becomes 
charged  with  its  vapour.  The  hot  platinum  wire  causes  the  oxidation 
of  the  vapour,  sufficient  heat  being  thereby  evolved  to  keep  the  wire 
at  the  necessary  temperature.  The  resulting  formic  aldehyde,  together 
with  water  and  unaltered  methylic  alcohol,  liquefy  in  the  condenser 
and  collect  in  the  receiver. 

The  distillate  has  a  penetrating  smell,  reduces  solutions  of  silver 
salts,  and  is  converted  into  a  yellow  oil  by  potassic  hydrate.  Formic 
aldehyde  has  not  yet  been  obtained  from  it  in  a  pure  state. 

If  the  liquid  be  evaporated  on  the  water  bath  the  greater  part  of 
the  aldehyde  is  evolved.  A  part,  however,  remains  as  a  solid  mass  of 
paramethyl  aldehyde. 

390.  Paramethyl  aldehyde,  or  trimethene  oxide,  formerly  known 
as  dioxy-methylene,  C3H603,  can  be  obtained  in  the  following  ways, 
in  addition  to  the  one  given  above  : — 

It  is  obtained  directly  from  methene  diiodide  by  heating  with 
argentic  oxalate.  This  latter  must  be  mixed  with  twice  its  weight  of 
powdered  glass  in  order  to  moderate  the  reaction  : 

3CH2I2  +  3Ag2C204  =  6AgI  +  3C02  +  3CO  +  C3H603. 

In  well-cooled  condensers  paramethyl  aldehyde  separates  from  the 
stream  of  gases  in  the  solid  state. 

On  heating  methene  diiodide  with  argentic  acetate  and  acetic  acid, 
methene  diacetate,  boiling  at  170°,  is  formed  : 

CH2I2  +  2AgO.C2H30  =  2AgI  +  CH2(OC2H30)2 ; 

from  which,  by  heating  with  water  at  100°  in  sealed  tubes,  paramethyl 
aldehyde  is  obtained : 

3CH2(O.C2H30)2  +  3H20  =  6HO.C2H30  +  C3H603. 

It  is  obtained  most  readily  by  heating  glycollic  acid  with  concen- 
trated sulphuric  acid  in  a  retort  to  150°  : 

CH2.OH 
3  |  +  3H2S04  =  3(H2S04,H20)  +  3CO  +  C3H603; 

CO.OH 

paramethyl  aldehyde  condenses  on  the  neck  of  the  retort. 

Paramethyl  aldehyde  is  a  colourless,  indistinctly  crystalline  body, 
insoluble  in  water,  alcohol,  and  ether.  Though  itself  odourless  it 
gives   the   penetrating   odour  of  formic  aldehyde  when  heated.     It

sublimes  freely  at  100°,  melts  at  152°,  and  boils  at  a  slightly  higher 
temperature.  The  vapour  evolved  is  not  paramethyl  aldehyde,  but 
the  simple  formic  aldehyde.  On  cooling  it  polymerises  again.  The 
vapour  density  is  found  to  be  1-037,  which  corresponds  to  the  formula 
CH20. 

That  paramethyl  aldehyde  is  correctly  represented  by  the  formula 
C3H603  can  only  be  inferred  from  its  analogy  with  parathio-methyl 
aldehyde,  into  which  it  is  readily  converted  by  hydric  sulphide,  and 
which  has  been  shown  to  possess  the  formula  C3H6S3*. 

If  paramethyl  aldehyde  be  heated  with  much  water  to  130°-150°  in 
sealed  tubes  it  dissolves,  and  the  liquid  then  possesses  the  properties  of 
a  solution  of  formic  aldehyde.  In  presence  of  water,  therefore,  the 
change  into  the  polymeric  modification  does  not  occur,  probably  in 
consequence  of  the  solution  containing  not  CH20,  but  the  dihydrate 
CH2(OH)2. 

Baric  hydrate  solution,  on  boiling,  colours  paramethyl  aldehyde 
yellow,  and  the  liquid  then  contains  some  baric  formate. 

By  careful  addition  of  argentic  oxide  the  aqueous  solution  of  for- 
mic aldehyde  is  converted  into  formic  acid  : 

CH20  +  2AgOH  =  Ag2  +  CHO.OH  4-  H20. 

Acetic  Aldehyde,  or  Ethylidene  Oxide,  C2H40.

392.  To  prepare  aldehyde  two  parts  of  80  %  alcohol  are  heated 
with  three  parts  of  manganic  dioxide  and  a  mixture  of  three  parts  of 
sulphuric  acid  and  two  parts  of  water,  and  the  vapours  condensed  by 
strong  cooling.  The  crude  distillate,  which  contains  several  other 
bodies,  such  as  acetal,  ethylic  acetate,  water,  and  unaltered  alcohol,  is, 
in  order  to  purify  the  aldehyde,  mixed  with  ether,  and  the  liquid 
saturated  with  dry  ammonia  gas.  Aldehyde  ammonia,  insoluble  in 
ether,  is  thereby  separated  : 

CH3.CHO  +  NH3  =  CH3.CH(OH).NH2, 

in  crystals,  whilst  all  impurities  remain  in  solution.  The  crystals, 
after  washing  with  ether  and  drying  over  sulphuric  acid,  are  dissolved 
in  a  little  water,  mixed  with  dilute  sulphuric  acid,  and  distilled,  when 
aldehyde  and  some  water  pass  over  : 

2CH3.CH(OH).NH2  +  H2S04  =  (NH4)2S04  +  2CH3.CHO. 

The  distillate  is  allowed  to  stand  some  time  over  fused  calcic 
chloride  and  then  rectified,  the  pure  aldehyde  being  collected  in  re- 
ceivers cooled  with  iced  water. 

Instead  of  manganic  dioxide,  potassic  dichromate,  in  pieces  about 
the  size  of  peas,  is  generally  used  as  the  oxidising  agent.  Fifteen 
parts  of  this  is  treated  with  a  mixture  of  ten  parts  of  alcohol  and 
twenty  parts  of  sulphuric  acid,  which  has  been  previously  diluted 
with  three  times  its  volume  of  water. 

The  reaction,  which  speedily  begins,  is  so  violent  that  the  liquid 
enters  into  ebullition.  As  the  accompanying  bodies  are  more  difficultly 
volatile  than  aldehyde,  it  is  usual  to  separate  them  from  the  latter  by 
partial  condensation  before  condensing  it  by  strong  cooling. 

For  this  purpose  the  reaction  vessel  a  (fig.  20),  whose  volume  must 
be  four  times  that  of  the  mixed  ingredients,  is  connected  with  the 
lower  end  of  a  glass  worm  b  which  is  surrounded  with  water  of  60°. 
In  this  the  main  portion  of  the  accompanying  vapours  are  condensed 
and  returned  into  the  retort  A.  The  aldehyde  vapours  are  conducted 
from  the  upper  end  of  the  worm  tube  into  two  cylinders  c,  c,  containing 
anhydrous  ether,  and  surrounded  by  a  mixture  of  ice  and  salt,  in 
v-hich  the  aldehyde  liquefies.  At  the  end  of  the  reaction,  which  is 
c .  mpleted  by  slight  heating  of  the  reaction  vessel  by  hot  water,  all 
the  aldehyde  is  found  mixed  with  ether  in  the  two  cylinders.  Dry 
ammonia  gas  is  now  passed  into  the  cylinders,  and  the  crystalline 
aldehyde  ammonia  treated  as  already  described  to  obtain  pure  alde- 
hyde. 

393.  Acetic  aldehyde  is  a  mobile  liquid  boiling  at  21°,  of  sp.  gr. 
•801  at  0°.  In  the  air  it  evaporates  with  great  celerity  and  large 
absorption  of  heat.  The  odour  is  peculiar,  and  when  strongly  diluted 
not  unpleasant.  The  vapour,  when  breathed  in  large  quantity,  pro- 
duces a  feeling  of  tightness  in  the  chest.

The  vapour  density  is  1-52. 

Acetic  aldehyde  mixes  in  every  proportion  with  water,  alcohol, 
and  ether,  in  the  two  first  cases  with  considerable  evolution  of  heat. 

Aqueous  aldehyde  becomes  rapidly  acid  on  exposure  to  air,  being 
converted  by  that,  as  by  all  other  oxidising  agents,  into  acetic 
acid.  It  precipitates  metallic  silver  from  ammoniacal  silver  solutions, 
amnionic  acetate  being  formed  : 

CH3.CHO  +  2NH3AgOH  =  Ag2  +  NH3  +  H20  +  CH3.CO.O.NH4.

but  some  other  products  are  formed  at  the  same  time,  especially 
/3-butylene  glycol. 

Phosphoric  chloride  converts  acetic  aldehyde  into  ethylidene  di- 
chloride  (§  381),  and  alkalies  form  from  it  a  yellow  resin  (aldehyde 
resin)  of  still  uncertain  composition. 

By  long  contact  with  aqueous  hydrochloric  acid  aldehyde  is  con- 
verted into  aldol ;  by  heating  with  a  little  zincic  chloride  two  molecules 
of  aldehyde  condense,  with  elimination  of  a  molecule  of  water,  into 
crotonic  aldehyde. 


ACETIC  ALDEHYDE.  261 

By  long  heating  at  1 80°  with  acetic  anhydride  in  sealed  glass  tubes 
aldehyde  is  converted  into  ethylidene  acetate  :

This  is  a  colourless  liquid,  boiling  at  169°  and  not  miscible  with 
water,  but  which  on  heating  therewith  yields  aldehyde  and  two  mole- 
cules of  acetic  acid. 

Further  decompositions  of  ethylidene  oxide  will  be  mentioned 
later. 

394.  Chemically  pure  aldehyde  remains  quite  unaltered  in  air- 
tight vessels.  Small  quantities  of  acids  or  of  certain  salts  (as  zincic 
chloride)  cause  its  transformation  on  standing  into  two  polymeric 
modifications,  paraldehyde  and  metaldehyde. 

At  ordinary  temperatures  paraldehyde,  triethylidene  trioxide, 
C6H1203,  is  formed,  and  most  quickly,  and  with  great  evolution  of  heat 
and  diminution  of  volume,  when  a  drop  of  strong  sulphuric  acid  is 
added  to  pure  aldehyde.  Zincic  chloride,  sulphurous  anhydride,  and 
hydrochloric  acid  similarly  cause  this  change  in  a  short  time.  In  order 
to  obtain  pure  paraldehyde  the  modified  aldehyde  is  cooled  by  a  freez- 
ing mixture,  and  the  crystals  formed  are  separated  from  the  portion 
remaining  liquid,  which  still  contains  unchanged  aldehyde. 

Paraldehyde  is  a  crystalline  solid  below  +10°,  and  melts,  when 
perfectly  pure,  at  10-5°.  At  15°  the  liquid  has  the  sp.  gr.  -998;  it 
boils  at  124°.  The  vapour  density  is  4'58,  being  three  times  as  great 
as  that  of  aldehyde. 

Paraldehyde  is  difficultly  soluble  in  water,  and  still  less  on  heating 
than  at  ordinary  temperatures.  By  strongly  superheating  its  vapour, 
and  then  condensing,  ordinary  aldehyde  is  obtained.  The  same  de- 
composition occurs  on  distillation  with  sulphuric  acid.  Phosphoric 
chloride  converts  it  completely  into  ethylidene  chloride ,  acetic  anhy- 
dride, on  heating,  into  ethylidene  acetate.  By  these  reactions  there  is 
no  doubt  that  the  combination  of  three  aldehyde  molecules  to  one 
molecule  of  paraldehyde  takes  place  according  to  the  formula  :

395.  Metaldehyde  is  formed  by  the  action  of  somewhat  dilute 
sulphuric  acid,  sulphurous  acid,  calcic  chloride,  <fcc,  at  temperatures 
below  0°,  and  separates  in  white  needles  or  prisms.  Sometimes  this 
modification  is  also  obtained  at  ordinary  temperatures  under  conditions 
still  unascertained,  but  there  is  invariably  only  a  small  portion  of  the 
aldehyde  transformed  into  metaldehyde.  From  the  portion  remaining 
liquid  it  is  separated  by  decantation  and  suction.  It  is  insoluble  in 
water,  difficultly  soluble  in  cold  alcohol,  ether,  carbonic  disulphide,  he.

It  sublimes  slowly  at  100°,  more  quickly  and  without  fusion  at  112°- 
115°.  At  the  latter  temperature  it  is  partly  converted  into  aldehyde, 
the  conversion  being  complete  on  heating  for  several  hours  in  a  sealed 
tube.  Phosphoric  chloride  converts  it  into  ethylidene  chloride.  Its 
vapour  density  cannot  be  determined  on  account  of  its  ready  conver- 
sion into  C2H40,  and  on  this  account  the  molecular  weight  of  metal- 
dehyde  remains  unknown.  It  probably  contains  more  than  three 
aldehvde  molecules  united  together  in  similar  manner  to  that  in 
paraldehyde. 

Higher  Aldehydes. 

396.  Propionic  aldehyde,  or  propylidene  oxide,  CH3.CH2.CHO,  is 
prepared  by  oxidation  of  primary  propyl ic  alcohol  and  by  dry  dis- 
tillation of  a  mixture  of  calcic  propionate  and  formate.  It  is  a  mobile 
liquid,  of  suffocating  aldehyde-like  odour,  of  sp.  gr.  *8074  at  21°, 
and  boils  at  48,8°-49"5°.  It  is  no  longer  miscible  in  every  proportion 
with  water,  but  requires  five  volumes  of  the  latter  for  solution. 

397.  Butyric  aldehydes,  C4H80.  Two  isomers  exist  corresponding 
to  the  two  primary  butylic  alcohols. 

Normal  butyric  aldehyde,  or  butylidene  oxide,  CH3.CH2.CII2.CIIO, 
is  obtained  by  dry  distillation  of  calcic  normal  butyrate  and  formate  as 
a  liquid  of  penetrating  aldehydic  odour.  It  boils  at  75°,  has  sp.  gr. 
•834  at  0°,  and  dissolves  in  about  twenty-seven  parts  of  water.  It  is 
also  formed  in  small  quantity  in  the  oxidation  of  albuminoids  by  man- 
ganic dioxide  and  sulphuric  acid. 

p-rr 

Isobutyric  aldehyde,  or  isobutylidene  oxide,  p-rx3^>CH.CHO,  is  pre- 
pared by  oxidation  of  ten  parts  of  isobutyHc  alcohol  by  nine  and  a  half 
parts  of  potassic  bichromate  and  a  mixture  of  nine  parts  of  sulphuric 
acid  with  seventy-five  parts  of  water.  The  reaction  must  be  started 
by  gentle  heating,  and  then  completes  itself.  The  crude  distillate 
must  be  fractioned,  and  the  portion  passing  over  between  60°  and  80° 
shaken  with  a  concentrated  solution  of  hydric  sodic  sulphite.  A  com- 
pound of  this  latter  with  the  aldehyde  separates,  which  is  pressed  and 
distilled  with  solution  of  sodic  hydrate,  when  pure  isobutyric  aldehyde 
is  obtained.  It  is  also  prepared  by  the  dry  distillation  of  calcic  iso- 
butyrate  and  formate.  j 

Isobutyric  aldehyde  is  a  colourless,  strongly  refractive  liquid  of 
penetrating  odour,  which  boils  at  61°-62°  and  has  sp.  gr.  -8226  at 
0°.     It  dissolves  at  20°  in  about  nine  times  its  weight  of  water. 

By  hydrochloric  acid,  or  somewhat  concentrated  sulphuric  acid, 
as  also  by  addition  of  chlorine  or  bromine,  isobutyric  aldehyde  poly- 
merises with  evolution  of  heat  into 

Paraisobutyric  aldehyde,  which  crystallises  in  silky  needles,  re- 
crystallisable  from  water  and  alcohol,  and  melts  at  59°-60°.  The 
boiling  point  is  194°,  the  found  vapour  density  7-256,  which  corre- 
sponds to  the  tripled  molecule  C12H2403,  whose  theoretical  vapour 
density  would  be  7*464.  At  200°  paraisobutyric  aldehyde  is  still  not 
reconverted  into  isobutyric  aldehyde. 

398.  Valeric  aldehydes,  0$B-i  0O.  Four  of  these  bodies  are  possible, 
corresponding  to  the  primary  amylic  alcohols ;  only  two,  however,  are 
known  as  yet. 


ALDEHYDES.  263 

Normal  valeric  aldehyde,  amylidene  oxide  : 

CH3.CH2.CH2.CH2.CHO, 

is  obtained  by  dry  distillation  of  normal  calcic  valerate  with  calcic 
formate  as  a  liquid  boiling  at  about  102°  and  requiring  more  than 
thirty  parts  of  water  for  solution.  Its  odour  is  very  similar  to  that 
of  the  following  compound. 

Isovaleric  aldehyde,  isoamylidene  oxide,  or  valeral : 

°gp>CH.CH2.CHO, 

is  readily  obtained  from  fermentation  amylic  alcohol.  A  lukewarm 
saturated  solution  of  twelve  parts  of  potassic  dichromate  is  placed  in 
a  retort,  and  a  mixture  of  sixteen  parts  of  sulphuric  acid  with  eleven 
parts  of  isoamylic  alcohol  and  sixteen  parts  of  water  allowed  to  flow  in 
slowly  through  a  funnel  tube.  The  temperature  rapidly  increases  to 
that  of  distillation,  and  no  external  source  of  heat  is  required  till 
nearly  the  end  of  the  reaction.  The  vapours  passing  over  are  con- 
densed in  well-cooled  receivers,  and  yield  a  distillate  containing  besides 
valeral  some  isoamylic  alcohol,  isovaleric  acid,  isoamylic  iso valerate,  and 
much  water.  Potassic  hydrate  is  added  to  the  distillate  until  alkaline, 
with  shaking,  in  order  to  convert  the  acid  into  the  potassic  salt.  The 
oil  collected  above  the  aqueous  liquid  is  then  poured  off  and  shaken 
for  a  long  time  with  a  concentrated  solution  of  hydric  sodic  sulphite. 
This  latter  combines  with  the  valeral  to  a  difficultly  soluble  com- 
pound, which  separates  in  brilliant  plates.  These  are  collected  on 
linen,  pressed,  washed  with  ether,  dried,  and  distilled  with  concentrated 
solution  of  sodic  hydrate,  whereby  valeral  is  regenerated. 

Isovaleric  aldehyde  is  a  colourless  liquid  of  suffocating  apple-like 
odour,  which  boils  at  92-5°  and  at  0°  has  sp.  gr.  '822.  By  oxidising 
agents  it  is  converted  into  isovaleric  acid. 

399.  Normal  caproic  aldehyde,  CH3.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH2.CHO,  is 
obtained  by  the  dry  distillation  of  a  mixture  of  calcic  normal  caproate 
and  formate.  It  forms  a  colourless  liquid  boiling  at  127 '9°  and  of  sp. 
gr.  -8498  at  0°. 

Another  capi-oic  aldehyde,  probably  (CH3)2  :  CH.CH2.OH,  is 
prepared  by  distillation  of  calcic  isocaproate  and  formate  as  a 
penetrating  but  not  mipleasant-smelling  liquid,  boiling  at  121°.  It 
yields  with  nascent  hydrogen  a  hexylic  alcohol  boiling  at  150°. 

400.  (Enanthol,  or  cenanthic  aldehyde,  C7H140,  is  obtained  by  dry 
distillation  of  castor  oil,  the  distillate  being  shaken  with  hydric  sodic 
sulphite,  &c,  as  under  valeral,  as  an  oily  liquid  of  peculiar  disagree- 
able smell,  which  boils  at  152°  and  has  sp.  gr.  *827.  As  already 
mentioned  (§  172),  this  is  probably  normal  ainanthic  aldehyde: 

CH3.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH2COH. 

400a.  The  remaining  known  members  of  the  series  have  been 
prepared  by  dry  distillation  of  intimate  mixtures  of  calcic  formate 
with  the  calcic  salts  of  the  requisite  acid,  under  reduced  pressure 
(15-25  mm.)     They  are  : — 

Laurie  aldehyde,  Cj  ^o^CHO.  from  lauric  acid,  melts  at  44'5°  and 
boils  at  184°-185°  under  100  mm.  pressure.  It  forms  a  brilliant 
white,  odourless,  crystalline  mass.

400&.  Myristic  aldehyde,  C13H27.CHO,  from  myristic  acid,  melts 
at  52-5°  and  boils  at  214°-215°  under  100  mm.  pressure. 

401.  Palmitic  aldehyde,  C15H31.CHO,  from  palmitic  acid,  forms 
nacreous  leafy  crystals,  melting  at  58"50.  Under  100  mm.  pressure  it 
boils  at  239°-240°.  By  oxidation  of  cetylic  alcohol  a  body  is  obtained 
melting  at  52°,  but  it  appears  doubtful  if  this  is  palmitic  aldehyde. 

401a.  Stearic  aldehyde,  C17H35.CHO,  from  stearic  acid,  crystal- 
lises in  fine  crystal  leaves  with  bluish  shimmer;  it  melts  at  6  3 '5°  and 
boils  at  259°-261°  under  100  mm.  pressure. 

Ethereal  Compounds  of  the  Aldehyde  Radicals. 

402.  The  polymeric  modifications  of  the  aldehydes  above  mentioned 
may  be  classed  amongst  these  compounds,  as  in  them  the  several 
aldehyde  radicals  are  held  together  by  oxygen.  In  the  true  sense, 
however,  the  term  is  restricted  to  compounds  in  which  aldehyde 
radicals  and  the  monad  alcohol  radicals  are  joined  together  by  oxygen, 
giving  bodies  of  the  general  formula  : 

^mli2m+  l 

CH(OCnH2n  +  1)2 

The  number  of  compounds  known  is  not  large,  only  those  of  methene 
and  ethylidene  having  been  prepared. 

They  were  first  obtained  by  incomplete  oxidation  of  the  respective 
primary  alcohols,  together  with  the  aldehydes,  one  oxygen  atom 
acting  on  three  alcohol  molecules  according  to  the  equation  : 

3CnH2n+  ,OH  +  O  =  2H20  +  CnH2n(OCnH2n+1)2. 

These  bodies  are  also  obtained  by  mixing  aldehydes  with  anhydrous 
alcohols,  especially  if  the  mixture  be  heated  to  100°  for  some  time  : 

^m^l2m+ 1  ^m^2m+i 

|  +  2HO.CnH2n+1  =  H20+  | 

CHO  CH(O.CnH2n  +  1)2 

By  limited  oxidation  they  are  first  converted  into  aldehydes  : 

^m*l2m+1  ^mH2m+l 

I  +  20  =  H20  +  3  | 

CH(O.CH2.CmH2m+1)2  CHO 

403.  Methene  dimethylate,  methylal,  or  formal,  CH3(O.CH3)2,  is 
obtained  on  heating  methylic  alcohol  with  manganic  dioxide  and 
sulphuric  acid,  and  is  separated  from  the  crude  distillate  by  fractional 
distillation.  It  is  a  colourless  liquid  which  boils  at  42°  and  has  sp. 
gr.  -855.  The  vapour  density  is  2*625.  With  alcohol  and  ether 
formal  can  be  mixed  in  every  proportion  ;  it  dissolves  in  about  three 
times  its  weight  of  water.  On  saturation  of  its  aqueous  solution  with 
potassic  hydrate  it  is  again  precipitated. 

404.  Ethylidene  dimethylate,  CH3.CH(O.CH3)2,  is  found  in  crude 
wood  spirit,  and  is  prepared  by  oxidation  of  a  mixture  of  methylic  and 
ethylic  alcohols,  or  more  readily  by  heating  aldehyde  with  absolute 
methylic  alcohol.  It  is  liquid,  boils  between  63°  and  65°,  and  has 
sp.  gr.  -8674  at  1°  and  a  vapour  density  of  3*16. 


ACETAL.  265 

O  PIT 

Ethylidene  methylate-ethylate,  CH3.CH<VC  j|  ,  is  obtained,  to- 
gether with  the  foregoing,  by  oxidation  of  a  mixture  of  ethylic  and 
methylic  alcohols,  as  a  liquid  boiling  at  85°. 

405.  Ethylidene  ethylate,  ethylidene  diethyl-ether,  or  acetal, 
CH3CH(O.C2H5)2,  is  formed  by  the  oxidation  of  ethylic  alcohol, 
and  is  contained  in  that  fraction  of  the  distillate  coming  over 
between  90°  and  110°.  By  saturation  of  the  liquid  with  calcic 
chloride  it  separates  as  an  oil  which  floats  on  the  surface,  and  is 
purified  by  fractional  distillation.  It  is  obtained  more  readily  by 
heating  aldehyde  with  absolute  alcohol  to  100°.  Ethylidene  di- 
bromide,  when  treated  with  sodic  ethylate,  gives  in  part  acetal : 

CH3.CHBr2  +  2NaO.C2H5  =  2NaBr  +  CH3CH.(O.C2H5)2. 

Ethylidene  dichloride,  on  the  other  hand,  yields  monochlor-ethylene 
by  similar  treatment  : 

CH3.CHC12  +  NaO.C2H5  ■=  NaCl  +  HO.C2H5  +  CH2:CHC1. 

Acetal  is  a  colourless,  mobile  liquid,  of  '821  sp.  gr.  at  225°,  which 
boils  between  104°  and  106°.  It  dissolves  in  eighteen  volumes  of 
water  at  25°,  but  is  less  soluble  at  higher  temperatures.  On  heating 
with  acetic  acid  it  gives  aldehyde  and  ethylic  acetate  : 

CH3.CH(O.C2H5)2  +  2HO.C2H30  =  H20  +  CH3.CHO 
+  2C2H5.O.C2H30. 

It  is  not  attacked  by  potassic  hydrate. 

Sulphurous  Acid  Compounds  of  the  Aldehydes. 

406.  As  already  mentioned  (§  389),  the  aldehydes  unite  with  the 
hydric  sulphites  directly,  and  without  formation  of  bye  products, 
yielding  crystalline  compounds.  By  their  properties  these  appear  to 
be  double  sulphites  containing  the  positive  monad  radical 

CmH2m+  j.CH.OH. 

Their  constitution  is  therefore  expressed  by  the  general  formula  : 

CmH2m+i 

CH.OH 

O.S02Na 

They  are  readily  decomposed  by  basic  hydrates,  or  even  by  the  car- 
bonates of  the  alkalies,  aldehyde  being  again  formed  : 

MmH2m+i  ^mH2m+ 1 

2CH.OH      +  Na2C03  -  C02  +  2NaO.S02.Na  +  2CHO 

OS02Na 

The  action  of  acids  also  causes  the  decomposition  of  these  compounds 
into  salts  of  the  acids,  aldehyde,  and  sulphurous  acid. 


266       DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  ALDEHYDE  RADICALS,   CnH2n. 

The  hydric  sulphite  compounds  of  the  lower  members  of  the  series 
are  readily  soluble  in  water,  those  of  the  higher  members  difficultly 
soluble;  these  latter,  therefore,  serve  as  a  means  of  separating 
aldehydes  from  mixtures  with  other  bodies.  If  the  aldehydes  in  such 
mixtures  be  either  difficultly  soluble  or  insoluble  in  water,  they  must 
be  shaken  violently  for  a  long  time  with  saturated  solution  of  the 
alkaline  hydric  sulphite,  it  being  well  to  heat  the  mixture  previously. 

407.  Ethylidene-hydrate  metallic  sulphites,  or  aldehyde  metallic 
sulphites,  CH3.CH(OH).O.S02M.  These  compounds,  which  are 
readily  soluble  in  water,  are  best  prepared  by  slow  addition  of  acetic 
aldehyde  to  well-cooled  saturated  solutions  of  the  acid  sulphites  of  the 
respective  metals,  until  the  liquid,  after  standing  for  some  time  in 
closed  vessels,  smells  of  aldehyde.  From  the  solutions  so  prepared 
the  crystalline  salts  are  obtained  either  by  precipitation  with  strong 
alcohol  or  by  evaporation  in  a  dry  vacuum.  On  heating  alone  at 
100°  they  decompose  into  aldehyde,  sulphurous  anhydride,  and  a 
neutral  sulphite. 

Ethylidene-hydrate  potassic  sulphite,  CH3.CH(OH).O.S02K, 
crystallises  in  tufts  of  needles  the  sodic  salt  CH3.CH(OH).O.S02Na, 
by  evaporation  in  fatty  plates,  by  precipitation  of  its  solution  by 
alcohol  in  satiny  needles.  The  amnionic  salt  prepared  from  aldehyde 
and  hydric  ammonic  sulphite  crystallises  in  small  needles,  which 
dissolve  in  six  times  their  weight  of  water  at  16°  and  in  the  dry  state 
are  not  decomposed  at  100°.  It  contains  H20  less  than  is  required 
by  the  formula 

C2H4(OH)O.S02lSrH4, 

and  corresponds,  very  likely,  to  one  of  the  formulae 

CH3  CH3

probably  by  its  stability  at  300°,  to  the  last.  By  dissolving  baric 
carbonate  in  aqueous  sulphurous  acid  mixed  with  excess  of  aldehyde 
and  precipitating  the  filtered  solution  by  alcohol,  a  satiny  precipitate 
of  the  baric  salt  (CH3.CH(OH).O.S02)2Ba  is  obtained. 

408.  In  the  case  of  the  remaining  aldehydes  generally  only  the 
compounds  with  hydric  sodic  sulphite  have  been  prepared.  The 
propionic  aldehyde  compound  is  readily  soluble ;  those  of  the  higher 
molecular  aldehydes  separate  on  shaking  with  concentrated  solution 
of  hydric  sodic  sulphite,  mostly  in  plates  of  silvery  lustre,  and  the  less 
soluble  the  richer  in  carbon  the  aldehyde  is. 

Oxy chlorides  of  the  Aldehyde  Radicals. 

409.  In  consequence  of  their  divalent  nature  the  aldehyde  radicals 
can  unite  with  two  different  elements,  such  as  chlorine  and  oxygen, 
which  latter,  being  diad,  can  still  unite  with  other  radicals.  Chloro- 
hydrates  are  not  known,  but  chlor  ethers  and  chlor  salts  exist.

(CH3)20  +  2C12  =  (CH2C1)20  +  2HC1, 

and  is  separated  from  the  liquid  products  by  fractional  distillation. 
It  is  a  liquid  boiling  at  105°,  of  suffocating,  tear-exciting  odour,  of  sp. 
gr.  1*315  at  20°,  decomposed  by  water  into  hydrochloric  acid  and 
formic  aldehyde  or  paraformic  aldehyde  : 

(CH2C1)20  +  H20  =  2HC1  +  2CH20. 

411.  Ethylidene  chloro-ethylate,  CH3.CHC1.0.C2H5.  If  hydro- 
chloric acid  gas  be  conducted  to  saturation  into  a  well-cooled  mixture 
of  aldehyde  with  twice  its  volume  of  absolute  alcohol,  the  liquid 
separates  into  two  layers,  of  which  the  upper  contains  ethylidene  chlor- 
ethylate.  By  submitting  this  to  fractional  distillation  it  is  obtained 
as  an  oil  boiling  at  97°-98°,  which  at  eveiy  distillation  is  partially 
decomposed  with  evolution  of  hydrochloric  acid. 

With  an  alcoholic  solution  of  sodic  ethylate  it  yields  acetal : 

CH3.CH<^C  H    +  NaO.C2H5  =  NaCl  +  CH3.CH<^g» 

The  same  body  is  also  obtained  by  the  action  of  chlorine  upon  ethylic 
ether,  whence  its  other  name,  monochlor-ethylic  ether  (§  207). 

412.  Diethylidene  chlor-oxide,  or  ethylidene  oxy chloride  : 

CH3.CHC1.0.CHC1.CH3, 

is  formed  by  passing  hydrochloric  acid  gas  into  aldehyde  at  0°.  The 
liquid  divides  into  two  layers,  of  which  the  upper  is  decanted,  quickly 
dried  by  calcic  chloride,  and  heated  to  60°-70°,  whilst  a  stream  of 
carbonic  anhydride  is  passed  through  it  in  order  to  remove  any  un- 
altered aldehyde.  The  residue  is  then  fractioned,  and  the  portion 
distilling  between  116°  and  117°  collected.  Pme  ethylidene  chlor- 
oxide  is  liquid,  smells  at  once  of  aldehyde  and  hydrochloric  acid,  and 
has  sp.  gr.  1-1376  at  12°.  It  is  not  directly  miscible  with  water,  but 
is  soon  decomposed  by  it  into  hydrochloric  acid  and  aldehyde  : 

(CH3.CHC1)20  +  H20  =  2HC1  +  2CH3.CHO. 

Its  formation  is  represented  by  the  equation  :

415.  On  bringing  an  aldehyde  and  sulphuretted  hydrogen  together 
there  result,  frequently  with  formation  of  intermediate  products,  the 
thio-aldehydes,  CmH2m  +  ^CHS,  which  as  yet,  however,  are  only  known 
in  polymeric  modifications.  These  latter  are  crystalline  bodies  of 
unpleasant  odour. 

416.  Trimethene  sulphide,  par  athiqf or  m- aldehyde,  C3H6S3,  is

The  same  body  is  obtained  by  heating  methene  diiodide  with  an 
alcoholic  solution  of  potassic  sulphide  : 

3CH2I2  +  3K2S  =  6KI  +  C3H6S3  j 

and  by  long  standing  of  carbonic  disulphide,  granulated  zinc  and 
dilute  hydrochloric  acid  : 

3CS2  +  6Zn  +  12HC1  ■=  C3H6S3  +  3H2S  +  6ZnCl2. 

Trimethene  sulphide  is  nearly  insoluble  in  water,  difficultly  soluble  in 
alcohol  and  ether,  more  readily  in  carbonic  disulphide,  and  most 
soluble  in  benzene.  It  crystallises  in  interlaced  needles  of  extremely 
disagreeable,  onion-like  odour,  which  begin  to  sublime  at  150°,  but 
melt  at  218°.  The  found  vapour  density  is  4 -98,  that  required  for  the 
formula  C3H6S3  being  4-77.  _ 

With  an  alcoholic  solution  of  mercuric  chloride  it  yields  silky 
needles,  quite  insoluble  in  water,  of  the  formula  C3H6S3HgCl2  ;  with 
argentic  nitrate,  plates,  which  can  be  recrystallised  from  hot  water,  of 
C3H6S3AgN03,H20,  and  gives  with  platinic  chloride  (C3H6S3)2PtCl4. 
By  heating  at  170°  with  argentic  sulphate  it  yields  paraform-aldehyde, 
03H603. 

Methene  sulpho-carbonate  is  obtained  by  heating  methene  diiodides 
with  an  alcoholic  solution  of  sodic  sulpho-carbonate  : 

CH2I2  +  ^J>CS  =  2NaI  +  CH2<|>CS, 

as  a  yellowish  white  amorphous  powder.  The  molecular  formula  is 
probably  a  multiple  of  the  above  given.

This  solidifies  when  strongly  cooled,  melts  again  at  —  2°,  and  at  35° 
begins  to  boil  with  decomposition,  pure  aldehyde  passing  over.  By 
treatment  with  acids  it  is  split  up  into  aldehyde  and  solid  parathio- 
aldehyde,  or  triethylidene  trisulphide,.  C6H12S3.  In  consequence  of 
this  only  the  latter  body  is  obtained  when  sulphuretted  hydrogen  is 
conducted  into  strongly  acidulated  aldehyde.  It  is  also  readily  pre- 
pared from  paraldehyde :

Thio-paraldehyde  crystallises  in  colourless  needles  of  garlic  odour, 
insoluble  in  water,  but  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether,  and  slowly 
subliming  on  gentle  heating.  The  vapour  density  is  found  to  be 
6*199,  corresponding  to  the  molecular  formula  C6H12S3,  which  re- 
quires 6  #22. 

418.  The  thio-aldehydes  richer  in  carbon  are  less  known.  Iso- 
butyric  aldehyde  is  converted  by  sulphuretted  hydrogen  into  an  oil  of 
unpleasant,  onion-like  odour,  and  which  has  not  yet  been  obtained  in 
the  crystalline  state. 

Isovaleric  aldehyde  only  reacts  with  sulphuretted  hydrogen  when 

in  aqueous  solution.     There  results  a  crystalline  mass  of  isoamylidene 

CH 
sulphide,  p-rr3^>CH.CH2.CHS.    Re-crystallised  from  alcohol  or  ether, 

this  isovaleric  thio-aldehyde  forms  white,  asbestos-like  crystals  of 
nauseous  odour,  which  melt  at  69°  and  can  only  be  volatilised  un- 
changed in  vacuo.  The  vapour  density  =  found  3-508,  calculated 
3525. 

A  selenio-isovaleric  aldehyde  is  obtained  from  valeral  and  hydric 
selenide  in  crystalline  crusts  of  fearful  odour.  It  melts  at  56 "5°, 
sublimes  even  at  ordinary  temperatures,  and  is  readily  decomposed 
with  separation  of  selenium. 

Sulphonic  Acids  of  the  Aldehyde  Radicals. 

419.  Methene  forms  a  methen-disulphonic  acid,  generally  termed 
methionic  acid,  CH2(S02.OH)2,  which  can  be  obtained  by  oxidation 
of  methene  sulpho- carbonate  by  nitric  acid.  It  is  also  formed  in  small 
quantity  by  the  action  of  sulphuric  anhydride  upon  ethylic  ether, 
more  readily  by  heating  acetamide  or  acetonitrile  with  Nordhausen 
sulphuric  acid,  the  reaction  being  probably  as  follows  : 

CH3.CO.NH2  +  S03  +  2H2S04  =  CH2<|g»£g  +  C02 
+  NH4.H.S04. 

The   free   acid  crystallises  in  long,  deliquescent  needles,  and  is  not

separates  in  difficultly   soluble,   nacreous  scales,    which  can   be   re- 
crystallised  from  boiling  hydrochloric  acid. 

420.  Methene-hydrate  sulphonic  acid,  CH2(OH).S02.OH,  is  formed 
when  the  vapour  of  sulphuric  anhydride  is  passed  into  a  well-cooled 
mixture  of  methylic  alcohol  and  sulphuric  acid.  As  this  mixture 
would  contain  hydric  methylic  sulphate,  the  process  piobably  is  as 
follows : 

S02.OH 
CH3  | 

|  +  S03  =   CH2 

O.S02OH  | 

O.S02.OH 

The  liquid  is  then  boiled  with  water  for  several  hours  :

O.S02.OH  OH 

and  neutralised  with  plumbic  carbonate  whilst  still  boiling. 

The  liquid,  filtered  from  the  plumbic  sulphate,  contains  plumbic 
methene-hydrate  sulphonate ;  this  is  decomposed  by  hydric  sulphide, 
and  after  filtration  of  the  precipitated  plumbic  sulphide  is  saturated 
with  metallic  carbonates  in  order  to  prepare  the  respective  salts.  The 
potassic  salt,  CH2.(OH).S02OK,  crystallises  in  the  rhombic  system 
the  baric  salt  in  colourless  tables.  Both  free  acid  and  salts  are  very 
stable. 

421.  Ethylidene  disulphonic  acid  is  not  known,  but  on  heating 
ethylidene  dichloride  with  normal  sodic  sulphite  at  140°  in  sealed 
tubes  a  salt  of  ethylidene  chlor-sulphonic  acid  is  obtained  : 

CH3.CHJ^  +  NaS02.ONa  =  NaCl  +  CH3.CH  j!^  QNa 

To  purify  the  compound  the  contents  of  the  tube  are  treated  with 
excess  of  sulphuric  acid  and  evaporated,  in  order  to  decompose  sodic 
chloride  and  excess  of  sodic  sulphite.  The  residual  acid  mass  is  then 
neutralised  with  sodic  hydrate,  evaporated  to  complete  dryness,  treated 
with  boiling  absolute  alcohol,  and  filtered.  This  dissolves  the  ethyl- 
idene chloro-sulphonate,  and  on  cooling  the  filtrate,  nacreous  plates  of 
the  above-given  formula  separate.  The  baric  salt  crystallises  in 
warty  masses.     Both  salts,  as  also  the  acid,  are  very  stable  bodies. 

Nitrogen  Compounds  of  the  Alcohol  Radicals. 

422.  Most  aldehydes  unite  directly — with  evolution  of  heat — 
with  one  molecule  of  ammonia,  jielding  crystalline  compounds,  the 
aldehyde  ammonias,  which  behave  as  the  hydrate  amides  of  the  diad 
radicals  :

These  compounds  readily  yield  aldehyde  when  treated  with  acids  : 

CmH2m+1.CH(OH)NH2  +  H2S04  =  CmH2m  +  1.CHO  +  NH4.HS04. 

By  passing  hydric  sulphide  into  the  aqueotfs  solution  of  these  sub- 
stances water  and  amnionic  sulphide  are  formed,  and  crystals  of 
sulphuretted  bases,  the  thialdines,  separate  : 

3(CmH2m+1.CH.OH.NH2)  +  3H2S  =  3H20  +  (NH4)2S 
+  (CmH2m+1.CH)3NH.S2, 

which  yield  crystalline  salts  with  one  equivalent  of  acid.  These 
thialdines  and  their  salts  are  probably  bodies  of  the  constitution 
expressed  by  the  general  formulas :

If  an  alcoholic  solution  of  an  aldehyde  ammonia  be  treated  with

obtained : 

2CnH2n.OH.NH2  +  CS2  =  2H20  +  (CnH2n)2ST2H2CS2, 

whose  constitution  is  probably  expressed  by  the  formula  :

In  addition  to  the  hydrate  amides,  aldehydes  also  yield  with  ammonia 
other  products,  which  contain  no  oxygen ;  these  have  the  character  of 
nitrile  bases  of  the  aldehyde  radicals. 

423.  On  adding  methene  oxide,  best  in  the  form  of  paraformic 
aldehyde,  to  ammonia,  there  is  obtained  hexmethene  tetramine,  also 
termed  hexmethylenamine,  according  to  the  equation  : 

2C3H603  +  4NH3  =  6H20  +  C6H12N4. 

It  crystallises  from  alcohol  in  brilliant  colourless  prisms  or  rhombo- 
hedrons,   which  have  an  unpleasant   odour  on  heating,  and  partly

sublime  undecomposed  at  100°.  It  is  readily  soluble  in  water,  diffi- 
cultly in  cold  alcohol,  and  behaves  as  a  monacid  base. 

With  hydrochloric  acid  it  gives  the  salt  C6H12N4.HC1,  crystal- 
lising in  white  needles,  whose  aqueous  solution  yields  with  platinic 
chloride  a  precipitate  of  the  formula  2C6H12N4HCl,PtCl4. 

The  structural  formula  of  hexamethene  tetracaine  is  probably 

By  boiling  with  dilute  acids  it  is  reconverted  into  formic  aldehyde  :

separates  in  well-formed  colourless  rhombohedra  when  dry  ammonia 
is  passed  into  a  mixture  of  anhydrous  ether  and  acetic  aldehyde.  The 
crystals  have  a  peculiar  odour,  like  that  of  the  excrements  of  mice, 
and  are  very  soluble  in  water,  as  also  in  alcohol.  The  vapour  density 
determined  at  100°-160°  in  vacuo  is  2*098  the  number  calculated 
from  the  molecular  formula  being  2*108.  At  reduced  pressures  alde- 
hyde ammonia  can  be  obtained  at  these  temperatures  in  the  state 
of  vapour,  but  at  ordinary  atmospheric  pressure  it  decomposes  below 
100°,  and  still  more  quickly  if  water  be  present,  turning  yellow  or 
brown,  and  yielding  water,  ammonia,  and  amorphous  basic  oxytetral- 
dine : 

4CH3.CH(OH).NH2  =  3NH3  +  3H20  +  C8H13NO. 

(Oxytetraldine.) 
It  suffers  a  similar  decomposition  when  left  for  a  long  time  either 
when  damp  or  in  presence  of  alcohol,  being  thereby  converted  into  an 
amorphous  oxygen  free  base — hydracetamide  or  aldehydine,  C6H12N2, 
which  probably  is  triethylidene  diamine  :

(C6H12N2,HCl)2,PtCl4  is  amorphous. 

If  the  diacid  salt  be  boiled  with  water  it  gives  amnionic  chloride 
and  bxy-trialdine  hydrochloride : 

(CH3.CH  :)3N2,2HC1  +  H20  =  NH4C1  +  C6HnNO,HCl. 

Oxy-trialdine  is  also  obtained  on  evaporating  a  solution  of  aldehy- 
dine  at  the  temperature  of  the  water  bath  : 

(CH3.CH  :)3N2  +  H20  =  NH3  +  C6HnNO, 
as  a  brown,  amorphous,  weakly  basic  subtance.     In  this,  as  in  oxy- 
tetraldine,  the  ethylidene  group  no  longer  occurs,  but  a  complicated 
carbon  nucleus  formed  by  simultaneous  union  of  such  groups  (com- 
pare pyridene  bases). 

425.  If  an  aqueous  solution  of  aldehyde  ammonia  be  saturated 
with  sulphurous  anhydride  and  then  evaporated,  a  crystalline  body 
remains,  of  the  formula  C2H7NS03,  which  is  not  identical  with  that 
prepared  from  hydric  ammonic  sulphite  and  aldehyde  (§  407),  but 
only  isomeric  therewith.  It  dissolves  in  one  and  a  half  times  its 
weight  of  water,  and  decomposes  at  100°  with  formation  of  a  resinous 
brown  mass. 

426.  By  passing  sulphuretted  hydrogen  gas  into  an  aqueous 
solution  of  aldehyde  ammonia,  brilliant  colourless  crystals  of  thialdine, 
C6H13NS2  =  (CH3.CH)3S2.NH,  separate.  These  are  little  soluble 
in  water,  but  readily  in  alcohol  and  ether,  fuse  at  42°,  and  can  be 
sublimed.  Its  nauseous  odour  is  very  persistent.  Thialdine  gives 
salts  with  hydrochloric  and  nitric  acids  : 

C6H13NS2,HC1  and  C6H13NS2,HN03. 

Heated  with  argentic  nitrate,  it  decomposes  into  aldehyde,  ammonic 
nitrate,  and  argentic  sulphide.  Alcoholic  iodides  unite  directly  with 
it.  Methylic  iodide,  for  instance,  yields,  after  some  hours  at  ordinary 
temperatures,  methyl-thialdine  iodide  :

soluble in  water,  but  considerably  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether,  even 
when  they  contain  water.  On  heating,  the  crystals  fuse  and  lose  their 
water  of  crystallisation,  becoming  again  crystalline  on  cooling.  The 
vapour  density  in  vacuo  at  160°  =  3*6,  calculated  3*559.  On  adding

Thio-valeraldine,  C15H31ISrS2,  or  [(CH3)2:CH.CH2.CH2]3S2NH,

On  heating  valeral  ammonia  with  potassic  hydrate,  three  molecules 
of  the  compound  lose  two  molecules  of  ammonia,  and  a  basic  body  is 
formed,  which  can  be  distilled  with  aqueous  vapour,  and  has  the 
formula  C15H33]Sr03,  and  therefore  contains  the  elements  of  three 
molecules  of  valeral  and  of  one  molecule  of  ammonia.  It  is  probably

N(CH2I)(CH3)3.OH. 

If  the  aqueous  solution  be  boiled  for  a  long  time  with  excess  of 
argentic  hydrate,  argentic  iodide  again  separates,  and  the  strongly

alkaline  methene-hydrate  trimethyl  amnionic  hydrate,  N=(CH3)3  ,   is

together  with  methene  hexethyl  diphosphonic  dichloride  : 

432.  The  metallic  and  halogen  substitution  derivatives  of  the 
nitro-paraffins,  already  mentioned  (§§  289-292),  must  be  regarded  as

are  termed  ketones  or  acetones.  It  is  self-evident  that  the  paraffin

member  of  the  homologous  ketone  series  CnH2nO  is  acetone,  C3H60  or

A  large  number  of  higher  homologues  are  known,  but  their  derivatives

435.  A  method  of  general  application  for  the  synthetical  prepara- 
tion of  ketones  consists  in  the  dry  distillation  of  the  salts  of  monobasic 
organic  acids  of  the  formula  CnH2n-iO.OH.  If  such  salts  be  sub- 
mitted to  high  temperatures  in  absence  of  air,  a  metallic  carbonate  is 
left,  whilst  a  ketone  is  evolved  as  the  main  product.  From  a  salt  of 
a  single  organic  acid  a  ketone  is  obtained  whose  two  alcohol  radicals 
are  similar  :

A  mixture  of  the  salts  of  two  acids,  on  the  other  hand,  yields,  in  addi-

acids  with  formates,  as

so  similarly : 

CH3.CO.ONa  +  CH3.CO.ONa  =  CO(ONa)2  +  CH3.CO.CH3. 

The  ketone  obtained  as  main  product  contains  invariably  a  carbon 
atom  less  than  the  sum  of  those  contained  in  the  two  salt  molecules 
from  which  it  is  derived. 

436.  The  following  are  of  especial  importance  amongst  the  further 
methods  for  the  synthetical  preparation  of  ketones  : — 

1.  By  the  action  of  the  acid  chlorides,  CnH2n+1.CO.Cl,  upon  a 
molecule  of  a  zinc  dialkyl,  a  ketone  is  formed  together  with  zincic 
chloride : 

0nH2n  + 1  OnH2n  + 1 

2C=0  +  Zn(CnH2n+  ,),  =  ZnCl2  +  2CO 

CI  CnH2n+1 

In  place  of  the  zinc  alkyl,  the  mercury  compound  of  an  alcohol 
radical  can  be  employed,  whereby,  however,  only  one  molecule  of  the 
acid  chloride  reacts  : 

CnH2n  + !  CnH2n  + ! 

CO  +Hg<§£-;  =  CO  +Hg<%H 

CI  OnH2n+1 

2.  Another  way,  which,  however,  only  serves  for  such  ketones  as 
contain  methyl  as  one  of  the  alcohol  radicals  (CH3.CO.CnH2n+i),  is 
from  ethylic  aceto-sod-acetate,  CH3.CO.CHNa.CO.C2H5.  This  latter 
is  first  heated  with  an  alkylic  haloid  : 

CH3.CO.CHNa.CO.O.C2H5  +  ICnH2n  +  1  =  Nal 
+  CH3.CO.CH(CnH2n+1)CO.O.C2H5, 

and  the  resulting  ethylic  alkyl  aceto-acetate  decomposed  by  boiling 
with  alkalies  or  baric  hydrate  : 

CH3.CO.CH(CnH2n  +  1).CO.O.C2H5  +  2KOH  =  CO(OK)2 

+  C2H5.OH  +  CH3.CO.CH2(CnH2n+1). 

437.  In  comparison  with  the  aldehydes  the  ketones  are  only 
difficultly  attacked  by  oxidising  agents.  By  energetic  action,  as  by 
boiling  with  chromic  and  sulphuric  acids,  or  by  fusion  with  alkaline 
hydrates,  every  ketone  is  converted  into  at  least  two  acid  molecules, 
of  which  one  contains  the  CO  group  with  one  alcohol  radical,  whilst 
the  other  is  formed  from  the  second  alcohol  group,  provided  it  be 
primary :

Acetic  acid  always  results  from  ketones  containing  the  methyl  group. 
If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  alkyl  separated  from  CO  be  secondary,  there

occurs,  together  with  the  acid  in  the  first  line,  a  new  ketone,  which  is 
further  oxidised  to  two  acid  molecules  :

438.  In  analogy  to  the  aldehydes  (§  406)  many  of  the  ketones 
unite  with  the  alkaline  hydric  sulphites  to  form  compounds  which 
crystallise  in  silky  plates,  and  from  which  the  ketone  is  regenerated 
on  treatment  with  alkaline  carbonates.  These  compounds  appear  to 
be  restricted  to  the  ketones  containing  methyl :

439.  By  moderated  action  of  nascent  hydrogen,  the  ketones  yield, 
together  with  the  secondary  alcohols,  double  tertiary  diacid  alcohols, 
termed  pinacones  (§  456),  which  are  formed  by  true  carbon  nucleus 
synthesis  :

Dehydrating  agents,  such  as  concentrated  sulphuric  acid,  &c,  when 
heated  with  ketones,  also  cause  synthesis  of  more  complex  molecules 
(so  termed  condensation),  but  of  different  nature.  These  and  other 
changes  will  be  considered  under  acetone. 

Acetone,  C3H60  =  CH3.CO.CH3. 

440.  Acetone,  or  dimethyl  ketone,  isomeric  with  propionic  aldehyde 
(§  396),  is  most  readily  obtained  by  dry  distillation  of  acetates, 
especially  the  calcic  salt : 

CH3  CH3  CH3

CO.O.Ca.O.CO   =  Ca/   ^CO  +  CO 


It  is  also  obtained  from  acetic  acid  by  conducting  its  vapour  through 
tubes  heated  to  dull  redness  : 

2CH3.CO.OH  =  CO  +  H20  +  CH3.CO.CH3. 

It  is  further  formed  by  the  dry  distillation  of  sugars,  cellulose,  tar- 
taric acid,  citric  acid,  and  other  organic  bodies,  and  is  therefore  a 
constituent  of  crude  wood  spirit  (§  165). 


ACETONE.  279 

If  acetic  chloride  diluted  with  anhydrous  ether  be  slowly  mixed 
with  zinc  methyl,  the  two  ingredients  react,  forming  zincic  chloride 
and  acetone  : 

2CH3.C0C1  +  Zn(CH3)2  +  ZnCl2  +  2CH3.CO.CH3. 

Isopropylic  alcohol  is  very  readily  converted  into  acetone  by 
oxidising  agents : 

ci:>c<£H + 0 = h2o + «g3>co. 

Other  methods  of  formation  of  acetone  will  be  mentioned  later,  such 
as  from  propylene  and  glyceryl  derivatives,  from  ethylic  methyl- 
aceto-acetate,  kc. 

441.  For  the  preparation  of  acetone,  calcic  acetate  is  usually  heated 
to  dull  redness  in  an  iron  retort.  The  crude  distillate  is  then  dried 
by  calcic  chloride  and  submitted  to  fractional  distillation.  The  por- 
tion distilling  at  56°  is  nearly  pure  acetone. 

Crude  acetone  is  also  obtained  in  large  quantity  as  a  bye  product 
in  the  preparation  of  aniline  (which  see). 

If  acetone  be  required  in  a  state  of  perfect  purity,  purified  acetone 
must  be  shaken  with  a  concentrated  solution  of  hydric  sodic  sulphite, 
so  as  to  convert  it  into  its  crystalline  compound  with  this  latter. 
This  is  then  pressed,  washed  with  alcohol  and  ether,  completely  dried, 
and  decomposed  by  boiling  solution  of  sodic  hydrate  in  a  distillation 
apparatus.  The  aqueous  acetone  which  goes  over  is  then  dried  with 
calcic  chloride  and  finally  rectified. 

442.  Acetone  is  a  colourless,  mobile  liquid  of  peculiar  agreeable 
odour,  of  sp.  gr.  "SI 4  at  0°  and  boiling  at  86°.  Its  vapour  burns  readily 
in  air  with  a  luminous  but  not  smoky  flame.  It  mixes  in  all  propor- 
tions with  alcohol,  ether,  and  water.  From  the  latter  it  is  in  great 
part  separated  on  addition  of  very  soluble  salts,  such  as  calcic  chloride. 

Like  alcohol,  it  dissolves  many  substances  insoluble  in  water  (fats, 
colouring  matters,  &c.) 

When  acetone  is  treated  in  aqueous  solution  with  sodium  amalgam, 
it  yields  isopropylic  alcohol  (§  168,  2)  together  with  pinacone  : 

(a  +  2&)(CH3)2CO  +  (2a  +  2b)K  =  a(CH3)2.CH.OH

which  crystallises  in  nacreous  prisms,  is  pretty  soluble  in  pure  water, 
more  difficultly  so  when  the  liquid  contains  much  hydric  salt  or  ace- 
tone. It  is  also  in  great  part  precipitated  by  alcohol.  The  similar 
potassic  compound  is  anhydrous. 

443.  Acetone  is  oxidised  to  acetic  and  formic  acids  by  a  solution 
of  potassic  bichromate  and  sulphuric  acid,  especially  on  gentle  heating  : 

CH3.CO.CH3  +  KoCr207  +  4H2S04  =  K2Cr,(S04)4  +  4H20 
+  CH3.CO.OH  +  HCO.OH, 


280  DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  KETONE  RADICALS,   CJt^. 

the  formic  acid  being  in  great  part  further  oxidised  to  carbonic  anhy- 
dride and  water. 

An  analogous  reaction  occurs  on  passing  acetone  over  heated 
alkalies,  best  potash  lime  or  soda  lime  : 

CH3.CO.CH3  +  2K0H  +  H20  =  CH3.CO.OK  +  HCO.OK  +  3H2. 

At   the   same  time,  especially  at  higher  temperatures,  another  pro- 
cess occurs,  which  yields  carbonates  and  methane  : 

(CH3)2CO  +  2H0K  =  CO(OK)2  +  2CH4. 

444.  Strong  mineral  acids,  such  as  sulphuric  acid,  and  further 
alkalies  and  quick-lime,  on  gentle  heating  withdraw  water  from  several 
molecules  of  acetone,  and  yield,  by  coalescence  of  the  residues,  com- 
pounds richer  in  carbon.  The  chief  products  of  these  reactions  are 
mesityl  oxide,  C6H10O,  phor one,  C9H140,  and  mesitylene,  C9H12,  a 
liquid  hydro-carbon,  boiling  at  163°,  which  is  described  later. 

Mesityl  oxide  is  formed  according  to  the  equation  : 

2(CH3)2CO  =  H2O  +  C6H10O. 

It  is  a  mobile,  colourless  liquid,  of  peppermint  odour,  which  boils  at 
130°,  and  itself  possesses  the  properties  of  a  ketone  inasmuch  as  it 
takes  up  nascent  hydrogen,  and  with  phosphoric  chloride  gives  phos- 
phoric oxy chloride  and  a  chloride  of  the  formula  C6HJ0C12. 
Phorone,  formed  according  to  the  equation  : 

3C3H60  =  2H20  +  C9H140, 

crystallises  in  large  brittle  prisms,  melting  at  28°  and  boiling  at  196°. 
Mesityl  oxide  and  phorone  are  best  prepared  by  saturating  acetone 
with  hydrochloric  acid  gas.  The  product  is  allowed  to  stand  about  a 
fortnight  in  closed  vessels,  and  then  on  addition  of  water  gives  a 
yellow  chlorinated  oil,  probably  containing  the  chlor  compounds 
C6H10C12  and  C9H]4C12.  By  careful  addition  of  alcoholic  potassic 
hydrate  it  is  converted  into  the  above  oxides,  which  are  then  separated 
by  fractional  distillation.

445.  Dimethyl  carbon-dichloride,  or  methyl  chlor-acetol : 

CH3.CClt2.CH3, 
is  formed  by  the  action  of  phosphoric  chloride  on  acetone  : 
(CH3)2CO  +  PC15  =  (CH3)2CC12  +  POCI3, 

as  a  colourless,  mobile  liquid,  boiling  at  69°-70°,  and  which  is  isomeric 
with  propylidene  dichloride,  CH3.CH2.CHC12,  boiling  at  84°-87°. 
By  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  it  is  converted  into  monochlor  propylene 
(see  this) : 

CH3.CC12.CH3  +  KOH  =  CH3.CC1:CH2  +  KC1  +  H20, 

which  is  formed  also  in  large  quantity  in  the  preparation  of  the 
dichloride,  hydrochloric  acid  being  evolved  : 

CH3.CO.CH3  +  PC15  =  POCI3  +  HC1  +  CH3.CC1:CH2.

The  corresponding  dimethyl  carbon-dibromide,  or  methyl  brom-acetol,

(CH3)2CO  +  PCl3Br2  =  POCI3  +  (CH3)2CBr2, 

boils  between  113°  and  116°,  and  has  at  0°  sp.  gr.  1-815. 

446.  Thiacetone  is  obtained  as  the   doubled   molecule,  C6H12S2 

=  pTT3^>C<^,^>C<[pTT3,  on  bringing  together  the  higher  sulphides  of 

phosphorus  and  acetone.     The  reaction  : 

2P2S5  +  10C3H6O  =  2P205  +  5(C3H6)2S2, 

which,  however,  is  accompanied  by  other  processes,  evolves  much 
heat.  By  fractional  distillation  the  double  thiacetone  is  obtained  as 
a  yellowish  oil  of  extremely  unpleasant  and  persistent  odour.  It  boils 
between  183°  and  185°,  and  has  the  vapour  density  5 "08. 

447.  On  allowing  acetone  saturated  with  ammonia  gas  to  stand 
some  time,  as  by  heating  the  mixture  to  100°  in  sealed  tubes,  various 
basic  nitrogen  compounds  are  obtained,  which  probably  possess  some 
similarity  with  the  aldehyde  derivatives  obtained  in  analogous  manner, 
but  require  closer  investigation. 

An  acetone  solution  containing  hydrocyanic  acid  is  converted  on 
heating  with  hydrochloric  acid  into  a-oxyisobutyric  acid  (see  this). 
The  reaction  completely  corresponds  with  the  conversion  of  aldehydes 
into  acids  of  the  lactic  series. 

448.  Numerous  halogen  substitution  products  of  acetone  are 
known  :  monochlor  acetone,  C3H.,C10  or  CH3.C0.CH2C1,  and  two 
isomeric  dichlor  acetones,  CH3.C0.CHC12  and  CH2C1.C0.CH2C1  \  a 
trichlor  acetone,  C3H3CI3O3 ;  tetrachlor  acetone,  C3H2.C140 ;  penta- 
clilor  acetone,  CHC12.C0.CC13 ;  and  perchlor  acetone,  CC13.C0.CC13. 
They  are  all  liquids  of  powerfully  irritating  odour.  From  acetone 
itself  only  the  first  four  are  prepared,  the  two  latter  being  obtained 
from  other  organic  compounds,  such  as  citric  acid.  The  more  interest- 
ing of  them  will  be  described  later.  Some  bromine  and  iodine  sub- 
stitution products  of  acetone  are  also  known. 

Homologues  of  Acetone. 

449.  The  formula  C4H80  only  corresponds  to  a  single  ketone, 
that  isomeric  with  butyric  aldehyde,  methyl-ethyl  ketone  : 

CH3.CO.CH2.CH3, 

which  is  obtained  by  oxidation  of  secondary  butylic  alcohol  (§  169). 
It  is  also  obtained  by  double  decomposition  of  acetic  chloride  and 
zinc  ethyl : 

2CH3.COCI  +  Zn(C2H5)2  =  ZnCl2  +  2CH3.CO.C2H5, 

as  also  by  boiling  ethyl  ic  methyl  aceto-acetate  with  an  alkali  : 

CH3.CO.CH.(CH3).CO.O.C2H5  +  2KOH  =  K2C03  +  HO.C2H5

sulphites,  and  yields  acetic  and  isovaleric  acid  on  oxidation. 

453.  Mcthyl-hexyl  ketone,  or  methyl  oenanthone,  C8H160  or 
CH3.CO.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH3,  is  obtained  by  dry  distillation 
of  a  mixture  of  calcic  acetate  and  cenanthate,  and  by  the  oxidation  of 
methyl-hexyl  carbinol  (§  173).  It  boils  at  171°  and  yields  on  oxida- 
tion acetic  and  caproic  acids.     The  sp.  gr.  =  "818. 

An  isomeric  ketone,  termed  methyl  butyrone,  occurs  amongst  the

These  hydrocarbons  (defines)  all  contain  twice  as  many  atoms  of

same  percentage  composition,  and  are  polymeric  to  the  simplest  atomic 
proportion  formula,  CH2. 

Olefines. 
Hydrocarbons  of  the  Formula  CnH2n. 

458.  For  the  preparation  of  the  olefines  the  mono-acid  alcohols  or 
their  haloid  compounds  are  usually  employed. 

From  the  alcohol  molecules  a  molecule  of  water  must  be  removed. 
This  occurs  on  heating  with  strong  polybasic  acids,  such  as 
sulphuric  acid,  or  with  certain  salts,  such  as  zincic  chloride.  The 
higher  molecular  alcohols,  which  cannot  be  distilled  unchanged,  are 
resolved  on  heating  alone — by  distillation — into  water  and  define. 

By  employment  of  sulphuric  acid  as  the  decomposing  agent  there 
is  first  formed,  in  addition  to  water,  hydric  alkyl  sulphate,  which  at 
higher  temperature  splits  into  olefine  and  sulphuric  acid  : 

CnH2n+1.H.S04  =  CnH2n  +  H2S04  (§  215). 

As  the  latter  is  regenerated,  the  process  (similarly  to  that  of  the  for- 
mation of  ether,  §  201)  can  be  made  continuous.  For  this  purpose  the 
sulphuric  acid  is  heated  to  the  temperature  of  decomposition  of  the 
monalkyl  sulphate,  and  the  supply  of  the  alcohol  or  its  vapour  so 
regulated  that  the  temperature  remains  constant  at  that  point. 

The  secondary  and  tertiary  alcohols  are  most  readily  decomposed 
in  this  way  (that  is,  at  the  relatively  lowest  temperatures). 

If  the  alkyl  haloids  be  employed  as  the  raw  material  for  the  pre- 
paration of  olefines,  the  decomposition  is  effected  by  means  of 
alcoholic  potassic  hydrate.  The  potassium  unites  with  the  halogen, 
whilst  the  hydroxyl  residue  of  the  base  removes  a  hydrogen  atom

459.  Tri-  and  polyvalent  alcohols  yield  olefines  when  heated  with 
adequate  quantities  of  sufficiently  concentrated  hydriodic  acid  :

defines  with  n,  carbon  atoms  are  obtained  from  the  monobasic 
organic  acids  of  the  formula  CnH2n02  or  CnJI2n,+  1.OH  when  their 
salts  are  mixed  with  soda  lime  and  submitted  to  dry  distillation ;  not 
only  paraffins  being  formed  (§  149),  but  also  hydrogen  and  olefines  : 

Cn'H2n,+  1.CO.ONa  +  HONa  =  CO(ONa)2  +  H2  +  Cn,H2n„ 

Single  olefines,  especially  the '  first  members  of  the  series,  occur 
amongst  the  products  of  the  dry  distillation  of  complex  organic  bodies. 
Lighting  gas,  prepared  from  wood  or  coal,  invariably  contains  some 
quantity  of  ethylene,  C2H4. 

460.  The  true  olefines  invariably  unite  with  free  halogens  when 
brought  into  contact,  with  change  of  the  divalent  union  of  the  carbon 
atoms  into  monovalent,  and  formation  of  the  olefine  dihaloids.  As 
these  do  not  mix  with  water,  and  otherwise  resemble  oils,  ethylene 
received  the  name  olefiant  gas,  and  the  whole  group  of  hydrocarbons 
are  termed  olefines. 

The  property  of  direct  union  with  halogens  is  general  to  molecules 
with  other  than  single  carbon  union. 

Similarly  to  their  behaviour  with  halogens,  the  olefines  also  unite 
with  the  elements  of  hypochlorous  acid,  with  formation  of  olefine 
haloid  hydrates  : 

CH2         CI  CH2.01 

I         +1-1 
CH2        OH        CH2.OH 

That  olefines  unite  with  concentrated  sulphuric  acid  to  form  mon- 
alkyl  sulphates,  and  with  haloid  hydro-acids  to  form  alkyl  haloids,  has 
been  already  mentioned  (§  163),  as  also  the  fact,  in  the  case  of  olefines 
containing  more  than  two  carbon  atoms,  that  the  bodies  so  formed 
are  derivatives  of  secondary  or  tertiary  alcohols. 

461.  All  olefines  have  the  property  of  polymerising  at  the  moment 
of  their  formation,  their  nascent  bonds,  instead  of  uniting  to  divalent 
linking,  combining  with  those  of  similar  molecules,  and  so  yielding 
bodies  in  which  closed  rings  must  exist.  In  the  simplest  cases  two 
olefine  molecules  unite  together,  but  the  polymerisation  can  go  much 
further.  In  the  preparation  of  isoamylene  from  isoamylic  alcohol, 
diisoamylene  and  triisoamylene  are  invariably  formed.  Their  forma- 
tion may  be  explained  as  follows  :

462.  The  first  member  of  the  series  is  ethylene,  also  termed 
ethene  or  olefiant  gas,  as  the  property  of  yielding  an  oily  body  with 
chlorine  was  first  discovered  in  its  case. 

It  is  dimethene,  and  results  therefore  from  the  halogen  derivatives 
of  methene  on  removing  the  halogen  from  them  by  metals  : 

2CH2.I2  +  2Na2  =  4NaI  +  CH2 :  CH2. 

Similarly  it  is  formed  from  methylic  alcohol  on  heating  with  phos- 
phoric anhydride,  the  two  methene  groups  in  the  nascent  state 
uniting  to  an  ethylene  molecule. 

It  is  obtained  by  the  dry  distillation  of  many  organic  substances, 
such  as  fats,  resins,  coal,  wood,  &c;  in  small  quantity  also  by  the 
distillation  of  salts  of  organic  acids,  even  those  of  formic  acid.  Syn- 
thetically it  can  be  prepared,  together  with  methane,  by  passing  a 
mixture  of  the  vapour  of  carbonic  disulphide  and  sulphuretted  hydro- 
gen gas  over  heated  copper  : 

2CS2  +  2H2S  +  12Cu  =  6Cu2S  +  C2H4. 

It  is  most  conveniently  prepared  by  heating  ethylic  alcohol  with 
sulphuric  acid  or  boric  anhydride.  By  employment  of  the  first  the 
process  can  be  made  continuous,  the  method  being  as  follows  : — 

A  mixture  of  twenty-five  grams  alcohol  with  150  grains  of  con- 
centrated sulphuric  acid  is  placed  in  a  flask  of  two  to  three  litres' 
capacity,  which  is  placed  on  a  sand  bath  and  connected  to  a  series  of 
four  Woulffs  bottles,  of  which  the  first  serves  to  collect  the  condensed 
liquid  distillate  j  the  second  contains  concentrated  sulphuric  acid  ;  the

is  now  heated  till  ethylene  is  quietly  evolved,  and  a  cooled  mixture  of 
equal  parts  of  ethylic  alcohol  and  concentrated  acid  is  then  allowed  to 
flow  drop  by  drop  down  the  funnel  tube  placed  in  the  neck  of  the 
flask.  By  regulating  the  rapidity  of  the  flow  and  the  flame,  a  con- 
tinuous evolution  of  ethylene  is  obtained,  which  may  be  passed  from 
the  last  WoulfFs  bottle  into  a  gas  holder,  or  into  the  halogen  directly, 
if  required,  for  the  preparation  of  ethylene  dihaloids. 

463.  Ethylene  is  a  colourless  gas  of  peculiar  agreeable  odour, 
which  burns  in  air  with  a  clear  luminous  flame.  Its  density  is 
•9784.  At  0°  and  under  a  pressure  of  42°  atmospheres  it  condenses 
to  a  mobile,  colourless  liquid. 

Water  absorbs  about  %  volume,  alcohol  and  ether  about  two 
volumes,  of  the  gas.  Ethylene  unites  directly  and  readily  with  chlorine, 
bromine,  and  iodine,  to  form  dihaloids ;  it  is  also  absorbed  by  concen- 
trated sulphuric  acid,  especially  on  slight  warming,  hydric  ethylic 
sulphate  being  formed  : 

CH2  :CH2  +  H2S04  =  (CH3.CH2)HS04, 

from  which,  by  distillation  with  water,  ethylic  alcohol  can  be  re- 
generated. It  is  absorbed  with  much  greater  readiness  by  Nord- 
hausen  sulphuric  acid,  yielding  with  the  S03  ethionic  anhydride 
(§513). 

It  is  also  absorbed  by  concentrated  hydriodic  acid,  especially  on 
gentle  heating,  ethylic  iodide  being  formed  : 

CH2 :  CH2  +  HI  =  CH3.CH2I. 

At  a  red  heat  it  is  decomposed,  yielding  methane  and  tarry 
products. 

464.  Polymerisation  of  Ethylene. — In  the  distillation  of  ethylene, 
polymeric  products  are  always  formed,  though  but  in  small  quantity. 
These  are  more  abundantly  obtained  by  the  dry  distillation  of  metallic 
ethylic  sulphates.    Together  with  ethylene  : 

K.C2H5.S04  =  KHS04  +  C2H4, 

condensable  vapours  pass  over,  which  collect  in  a  cooled  receiver  to  a 
liquid  of  acid  reaction.  On  treatment  with  water,  an  oil  separates, 
from  which  on  strong  cooling  a  solid  hydrocarbon — etherine — crystallises, 
which  melts  at  110°  and  boils  at  260°.  The  portion  remaining  liquid 
is  termed  etherol.  Both  bodies  have  the  percentage  composition  of 
olefines  and  the  formula  CnH2n. 

Propylene,  C3H6  =  CH3.CH:CH2. 

465.  Propylene  is  frequently  observed  amongst  the  products  of  the 
dry  distillation  of  organic  bodies.  It  is  formed,  e.g.,  when  the  vapour 
of  isoamylic  alcohol  is  passed  through  red-hot  tubes  and  by  the  dry  dis- 
tillation of  the  salts  of  many  acids  of  the  formula  CnH2n02.  Iso- 
propylic  iodide  is  converted  into  propylene  by  alcoholic  potassic  hy- 
drate even  at  40°-50°  : 

CH-,.CHI.CH3  +  KOH  =  KI  +  H20  +  CH3.CH:CH2. 

Primary  propylic  iodide  suffers  the  same  decomposition,  only  with 
greater  difficulty. 

u

Propylene  is  further  obtained  by  the  action  of  phosphorous  iodide 
or  hydriodic  acid  upon  glycerine  (§  459).  Nearly  pure  it  is  obtained 
with  greatest  readiness  when  allylic  iodide  is  treated  with  zinc  and 
hydrochloric  acid  in  the  presence  of  alcohol : 

CH2  CH2 

2CH  +  2Zn  +  2HC1  =  Znl2  +  ZnCl2  +  2CH 

CH2I  CH3 

Propylene  is  a  gas  very  similar  to  ethylene,  and  of  the  density 
1  *498.  It  is  liquefied  on  great  compression.  It  is  readily  absorbed  by 
concentrated  sulphuric  acid  in  the  cold,  yielding  isopropylic  hydric 
sulphate,  which  even  at  ordinary  temperatures  soon  decomposes 
into  sulphuric  acid  and  polymeric  propylenes. 

It  yields  isopropylic  iodide  directly  with  concentrated  hydriodic 
acid,  and  isopropylic  chloride  by  long  heating  with  hydrochloric  acid. 

Butylenes,  C4H8. 

466.  The  two  tetracarbon  nuclei  admit  of  three  butylenes. 

1.  Normal  butylene,  CH3.CH2.OH  :CH2,  is  obtained  as  methyl 
allyl  by  heating  a  mixture  of  methylic  and  allylic  iodides  diluted 
with  ether  and  metallic  sodium  at  100°  in  strong  closed  vessels  : 

CH3I  +  I.CH2.CH:CH2  +  Na2  =  2NaI  +  CH3.CH2.CH:CH2. 

The  cooled  vessel  is  surrounded  with  a  freezing  mixture,  opened, 
and  the  butylene  by  gentle  heating  distilled  over  into  receivers  cooled 
to  at  least  —10°.  It  is  then  obtained  in  the  form  of  a  light,  mobile, 
colourless  liquid,  which  distils  at  about  —  4°.  It  unites  with  hydrio- 
dic acid  to  form  secondary  butylic  iodide. 

The  same  butylene  is  also  obtained  by  the  action  of  zinc  ethyl 
on  monobrom-ethylene  : 

Zn(C2H5)2  +  2BrCH:CH2  =  ZnBr2  +  2C2H5.CrI:CH2, 

and  by  the  decomposition  of  primary  butylic  iodide  by  potassic  hy- 
drate.    It  boils  at  -  5°. 

pTT 

2.  Isobutylene,  p-pr3^>C=CH2,  is   obtained  by  several  methods. 

Isobutyl  alcohol  and  tiimethyl  carbinol  both  yield  it  on  treatment 
with  sulphuric  acid  or  zincic  chloride,  a  great  part,  however,  poly- 
merising. It  is  more  generally  prepared  by  decomposition  of  isobutylic 
iodide  or  trimethyl  carbin-iodide  (§  193)  with  alcoholic  potassic  hy- 
drate : 

(CH3)2CH.CH2I  +  KOH  =  KI  +  H20  +  (CH3)2:C=CH2 

(CH3)2CI.CH3  +  KOH  =  KI  +  H20  +  (CH3)2:C=CH2. 

It  is  also  obtained  when  the  vapour  of  isoamylic  alcohol  is  passed 

through  red-hot  tubes,  and,  together  with  hydrogen  and  diisobutyl, 

by  the  electrolysis  of  aqueous  solutions  of  alkaline  valerates. 

It  is  an  unpleasant-smelling  gas,  which  condenses,  on  cooling  with  a 
mixture  of  ice  and  salt,  to  a  colourless  liquid  boiling  at  —  7°  to  —  6°. 

It  unites  readily  with  hydriodic  acid,  forming  trimethyl  carbin- 
iodide.     It  is  absorbed  by  a  mixture  of  three  parts  of  concentrated 


OLEFINES.  29! 

sulphuric  acid  and  one  part  of  water,  giving  hydric  trimethyl  carbin- 
sulphate,  which,  after  dilution  with  much  water,  yields  trimethyl 
carbinol  on  distillation  (§  169).  At  the  same  time  a  considerable 
portion  of  the  isobutylene  polymerises,  separating  even  during  the 
absorption  of  the  gas  as  a  colourless  oil,  which  consists  in  great  part 
of  triisobutylene,  C12H24,  boiling  at  173°-176°. 

3.  Pseudobutylene  is  formed  by  heating  secondary  butylic  iodide 
with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  :

and  by  heating  the  vapour  of  normal  secondary  butylic  alcohol  to  250°. 
It  is  liquid  at  0°,  boils  at  +  3°,  and  on  strong  cooling  crystallises. 
It  unites  with  hydriodic  acid  to  form  secondary  butylic  iodide. 

Amylenes,  C5H10. 

467.  Of  the  five  possible  hydrocarbons  of  the  amylene  formula  in 
which  two  neighbouring  carbon  atoms  are  doubly  united,  only  four 
have  yet  been  obtained,  and  in  part  still  require  investigation. 

1.  Normal  amylene,  or  ethyl-allyl,  CH3.CH2.CH2.CH  :CH2,  is 
obtained  by  the  action  of  sodium  on  a  mixture  of  ethylic  and  allylic 
iodides  : 

CH3.CH2I  +  ICH2.CH:CH2  +  Na2  =  2NaI 
+  CH3.CH2.CH2.CH:CH2. 
It  is  a  colourless  liquid,  boiling  at  73°,   which  gives  with  hydriodic 
acid  first  normal  secondary  amy  lie  iodide  (§  194),  and  unites  with 
hydrochloric  acid,  apparently  only  in  the  warm,  to  the  corresponding 
first  normal  secondary  amylic  chloride.     Normal  amylene  occurs  in 
the  fraction  distilling  between  30°-40°  of  the  products  of  the  dry  dis- 
tillation of  some  asphalts. 
rtfr 

2.  Isoamylene,  qtt3/^  :CH.CH3,  is  formed,  together  with  its  poly- 
mers, by  the  distillation  of  isoamylic  alcohol  with  zincic  chloride,  as  a 
mobile,  colourless  oil  of  peculiar  odour,  of  35°  boiling  point  and 
•663  sp.  gr.  at  0°.  It  combines,  even  in  the  cold,  with  hydrochloric 
acid  to  secondary  isoamylic  chloride,  with  hydriodic  acid  to  the  cor- 
responding iodide  (§  194). 

It  is  converted  nearly  completely  into  its  polymers  by  contact 
with  concentrated  sulphuric  acid,  or  by  action  of  zincic  chloride  on 
heating;  dilute  sulphuric  acid  partly  producing  this  change,  partly 
forming  secondary  isoamylic  hydric  sulphate. 

Diamylene,  C]0H20,  is  an  oil  boiling  at  165°  and  of  -777  sp.  gr., 
which  unites  with  two  atoms  of  bromine  to  form  Ci0H20Br.,. 
Triamylene,  C15H30  =  (C5H10)3,  distils  at  248°;  tetramyleiie, 
C20H40  =  (C5H10)4,  at  above  390°. 

3.  An  amylene  also  boiling  at  35°,  but  differing  from  the  fore- 
going, is  obtained  from  the  iodide  of  tertiary  amylic  alcohol  (§  170,  6) 

U2 


292      DEEIVATIVES  OF  THE  DIAD  ALCOHOL  RADICALS,  CnH^. 

by  decomposition  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate.  Its  odour  is 
different  to  that  of  isoamylene,  and  by  union  with  hydrochloric  acid  it 
is  reconverted  into  tertiary  amylic  iodide.     It  is,  therefore,  either 

°g2>C.CH2.CH3  or  ^>C=CH.CH3. 

Probably  it  has  the  first  formula,  as  the  second  agrees  more  with  the 
properties  of  the  former  isomer. 
4.  An  amylene  boiling  at  25°  : 


(chJ>oh-CH:CHs0' 


is  obtained  from  the  optically  inactive  isoamylic  iodide  by  action  of 
alcoholic  potassic  hydrate,  which  appears  to  yield  tertiary  isoamylic 
chloride  with  hydrochloric  acid. 

5.  Methyl-ethyl  ethene,  CH3.CH :  CH.CH2.CH3,  is  obtained  by  the 
action  of  potassic  hydrate  on  the  iodide  from  diethyl  carbinol.  It 
boils  at  36°. 

The  amylene  obtained  by  heating  zinc  ethyl  with  chloroform  : 

CHC13  +  Zn(C2H5)2  =  ZnCl2  +  HC1  +  C5H10, 
requires  further  investigation. 

Hexylenes,  C6H12. 

468.  Several  olefines  of  this  formula  have  been  prepared,  but 
scarcely  enough  investigated  to  enable  rational  formulae  to  be  assigned 
to  them  with  certainty.  Two  isomeric  hexylenes  occur  in  the  products 
of  dry  distillation  of  certain  asphalts,  which — the  one  id  the  cold,  the 
otber  only  on  heating — unite  with  hydrochloric  acid  to  form  two 
different  chlorides,  C6H13C1  (boiling  points  115°-117°  and  122°-124°). 

Normal  primary  hexylic  iodide  gives  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate 
a-hexylene,  boiling  at  68°-70°,probablyCH3.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH  :CH2. 

The  best  known  hexylene  is  obtained  by  decomposing  first  normal 
secondary  hexylic  iodide  (§  195)  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate.  It 
is  also  derived  from  normal  hexane,  and  is  probably  /3-hexylene, 
CH3.CH2.CH2.CH:CH.CH3.  Its  boiling  point  is  65°-66°.  With 
hydriodic  acid  it  yields  secondary  hexylic  iodide. 

Another  hexylene,  boiling  between  68°  and  72°,  is  obtained  by 
action  of  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  on  the  iodide  of  diethyl-metkvl 
carbinol  (§  171,  6).  Its  constitution  is  expressed  by  one  of  the  two 
formulae  : 

CH3.CH  ^UL±±3  oi  CH3.CH2>b— 0±±2- 

Hexylenes  from  other  sources,  as  by  decomposition  of  dichlorinated 
petroleum  hexane  by  sodium,  or  by  the  action  of  high  temperatures 
on  paraffin,  <kc,  may  be  passed  over  here,  not  having  been  sufficiently 
investigated. 

469.  Several  of  the  higher  members  of  the  olefine  group,  exclusive 
of  the  above-mentioned  olefines,  have  been  obtained.  From  such  of 
the  monovalent  alcohols  as  distil  unchanged  they  are  generally  pre- 
pared by  heating  with  sulphuric  acid  or  by  decomposing  the  corre- 
sponding haloid  compounds  by  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate.  By  the 
second  method  a  heptylene,  probably  (CH3)2C:CH.CH(CH3)2,  has 
been  obtained  from  the  iodide  derived  from  dimethyl-isobutyl  carbinol. 


HALOGEN   COMPOUNDS.  293 

It  boils  at  83°-84°  and  has  sp.  gr.  -714  at  0°.  And  by  the  first  method 
a-normal  secondaiy  octylic  alcohol  (caprylic  alcohol,  from  castor  oil) 
yields  an  octylene,  caprylene,  which  boils  at  118°-119c.  The  higher 
molecular  alcohols  which  cannot  be  volatilised  unchanged  decompose, 
on  dry  distillation,  into  water  and  hydrocarbons  of  the  formula 
CnH2n.  Cetylic  alcohol  thus  yields  cetene,  C16H32,  a  liquid  boiling 
at  275  degrees.  Cerotone,  C27H54,  and  melene,  C30H60,  are  crystal- 
line bodies,  which  readily  decompose  further  on  heating,  and  are 
therefore  scarcely  obtainable  in  the  pure  state.  Paraffin  (§  159)  in  all 
probability  contains,  together  with  high  molecular  paraffins,  also  some 
quantity  of  hydrocarbons  of  the  formula  CnH2n.  Such  bodies  also 
occur  in  different  natural  paraffin-like  bodies,  e.g.  in  ozocerite. 

Halogen  Compounds  of  the  Divalent  Alcohol  Radicals. 

470.  The  hydrocarbons  CnH2n,  existing  as  free  molecules  by  the 
diad  union  of  neighbouring  carbon  atoms,  combine  directly  with  two 
halogen  atoms  to  form  liquid  or  solid  dihaloids  insoluble  in  water. 
The  respective  bromides  and  chlorides  of  low  molecular  weight  distil 
unchanged;  the  higher  members  decompose,  at  least  partly,  on  heating, 
with  evolution  of  the  hydro-acids,  and  probably,  in  the  first  place, 
formation  of  halogen  mono-substituted  olefines  : 

CnH2nCl2  =  HC1  +  CnH2n_1Cl. 

The  few  iodides  known  are  unstable  bodies,  which  cannot  be  vola- 
tilised without  partial  dissociation  into  their  components. 

471.  By  action  of  alkaline  hydrates,  best  in  alcoholic  solution, 
these  halogen  compounds  cannot  be  converted  into  the  divalent 
alcohols;  the  metal  of  the  hydrate  removes  one  halogen  atom,  whilst 
the  OH  group  at  the  same  time  oxidises  and  removes  a  hydrogen 
atom,  and  with  renewed  double  linking  of  carbon  a  mono-halogenated 
define  is  formed : 

CnH2nCl2  +  KOH  =  KC1  +  H20  +  CH^^Cl. 

By  employment  of  a  large  excess  of  alkali,  or  by  action  of  sodic  or 
potassic  ethylates  assisted  by  heating,  this  process  is  repeated,  another 
halogen  atom  and  hydrogen  atom  being  removed,  and  a  hydrocarbon 
of  the  general  formula  CnH2n_2  formed  : 

CnH2n_,Cl  +  KOH  =  KC1  +  H20  +  CnH2n_2, 
CnHjn^Cl  +  NaO.C2H5  =  NaCl  +  HO.C2H5  +  CnH2n_2. 

In  these  latter  either  two  neighbouring  carbon  atoms  are  in  trivalent 
union,  or  else  the  double  union  occurs  twice  over  :

The  halogenised  defines  formed  as  the  first  products  of  the  action  of 
alkalies  are  themselves  capable  of  combining  with  two  halogen  atoms, 
and  the  resulting  trihaloids,  CnH2n_iCl3,  suffer  a  like  decomposition 
with  alkalies,  so  that  in  this  way  a  gradual  replacement  of  the  hydro- 
gen atoms  of  paraffins  by  halogens  can  be  effected.  The  processes  can 
be  expressed  by  the  following  series  of  equations  :

partial  polymerisation,  by  action  of  strongly  positive  metals  :

By  action  of  nascent  hydrogen,  best  from  zinc  and  hydrochloric  acid, 
or  by  action  of  hydriodic  acid,  the  olefine  dihaloids  are  converted  into 
paraffins  (§  149)  : 

CnH2nCl2  +  2HC1  +  2Zn  =  2ZnCl2  +  CnH2n  +  2.

ethylidene  dichloride  (§  381).       This  compound  was  discovered  in 
1795  by  four  Dutch  chemists,  and  was  long  termed  Dutch  liquid, 

ethylene   being   named   olefiant 
^Jfiil1  gas.     To  prepare   it,  equal   vo- 

lumes of  ethylene  and  chlorine, 
both  quite  dry,  are  brought  to- 
gether in  a  tritubulated  balloon 
(fig.  21).  The  union  is  accom- 
panied by  evolution  of  heat,  and 
the  ethylene  dichloride  formed 
condenses  on  the  sides  of  the 
balloon  and  flows  down  the  long 
neck  into  a  cooled  receiver,  from 
which  any  uncombined  gas  can 
e-cape  by  the  exit  tube. 

Ethylene  dichloride  is  a 
colourless,  mobile  liquid  of  sweat 
odour,  of  sp.  gr.  1*28  and  of 
boiling  point  85°.  It  is  insoluble 
in  water,  but  miscible  in  all  pro- 
portions with  alcohol  and  ether. 
By  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  it  is  converted  into  monochlor  ethylene, 
C2H3C1;  this  by  combination  with  chlorine  yields  a  trichlor  ethane,

of  chlorinated  ethylenes  and  ethanes,  of  which  only  the  two  members

is  formed,   with 


strong  evolution  of  heat,  by  bringing  together  bromine  and  ethylene 
gas.  In  order  to  prepare  this  important  body,  which  serves  as  the 
starting  point  in  the  preparation  of  other  ethylene  derivatives,  ethy- 
lene gas  is  absorbed  by  liquid  bromine  kept  well  cooled.  This  is 
frequently  done  in  a  thick  flask  of  2-3  litres'  contents,  on  the  bottom 
of  which  is  placed  120-150  grams  of  bromine  covered  with  water. 
The  flask  is  then  filled  with  olefiant  gas,  and,  when  the  air  has  been 
completely  expelled,  closed  with  a  cork,  through  which  passes  a  tube 
connected  with  a  gas  holder  filled  with  ethylene.  On  shaking  the 
flask  the  gas  is  quickly  absorbed  by  the  bromine,  and  is  constantly 
replenished  from  the  store  in  the  gas  holder.  Ethylene  evolved  in  a 
regular  stream,  as  in  the  above-given  method  (§  462),  can  be  con- 
ducted directly  into  liquid  bromine,  the  only  precaution  requisite 
beins;  that  the  gas  remains  a  sufficient  length  of  time  in  contact  with 
the  bromine  for  complete  absorption.     This  is  effected  by  passing  the

gas  through  the  bromine  contained  in  the  long  limb  of  the  bent  glass 
tube  in  fig.  22. 

As  soon  as,  by  either  of  these  methods,  the  bromine  is  nearly 
saturated  with  ethylene,  shown  by  its  being  nearly  decolorised,  the 
product  is  shaken  with  dilute  solution  of  alkali  till  colourless,  the  under 
layer  separated  from  the  aqueous  solution,  and,  after  mixing  with 
concentrated  sulphuric  acid  to  fix  the  water,  distilled  on  a  sand  bath, 
when  pure  ethylene  dibromide  passes  over. 

It  is  a  mobile,  colourless,  sweet-smelling  liquid  of  sp.  gr.  2*163; 
it  solidifies  at  0°  to  colourless  crystals,  melting  at  4-  9°.  The  boiling 
point  is  129°.  By  alcoholic  solution  of  potassic  hydrate  it  is  con- 
verted into  monobrom  ethylene,  CH2:CHBr  (boiling  point  23°), 
from  which  a  series  of  brominated  ethanes  and  ethylenes  can  be  pre- 
pared, similar  to  the  chlorine  derivatives  (§  473).

Ethylene  dibromide  can  be  regenerated  from  monobrom  ethylene,

Monobrom  ethylene  unites  more  slowly,  and  apparently  in  quite  a

and  on  stronger  heating  decompose  into  ethylene  and  free  iodine. 
This  change  also  occurs  at  ordinary  temperatures,  though  very  slowly.

Ethylene  diiodide  can  only  be  sublimed  or  preserved  colourless  in 
vessels  filled  with  ethylene  gas. 

Alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  decomposes  ethylene  diiodide  very 
readily.  Only  a  little  moniodo-ethylene,  CH2:CHI,  is  obtained,  as  a 
colourless  oil,  boiling  at  55°,  the  greater  part  being  converted  into 
acetylene,  C2H2  :

476.  Some  double  haloids  of  ethylene  are  known. 

Ethylene  chloro-iodide,  C2H4C1I  =  CH2C1.CH2I,  can  be  prepared 
by  the  action  of  ethylene  on  iodine  chloride,  and  by  decomposition  of 
ethylene  diiodide  with  a  little  mercuric  chloride  : 

2C2H4I2  +  HgCl2  =  Hgl2  +  2C2H4C1I. 

It  is  a  heavy  liquid  of  sweet  odour,  boiling  at  137°-138°. 

Ethylene  brom-iodide,  C2H4BrI  =  CH2Br.CH2I,  is  formed  when 
hydriodic  acid  (saturated  at  +  4°)  is  heated  at  100°  with  brominated 
ethylene,  and  when  iodine  bromide  is  saturated  with  olefiant  gas.  It  is 
a  colourless  mass,  melting  at  28°,  which  boils  at  163°  and  has  sp.  gr.

has  not  yet  been  observed. 

Propylene  dibromide,  C3H6Br2  =  CH3.CHBr.CH2Br,  is  formed 
by  the  absorption  of  propylene  gas  by  bromine,  and  by  heating  iso- 
propylic  bromide  with  liquid  bromine.  It  is  an  oil  boiling  at  142°, 
having  the  sp.  gr.  1*974.  It  is  converted  into  monobrom  propylene, 
CH3.CBr.CH2  (boiling  point  57G-58°),  by  action  of  alcoholic  potassic 
hydrate,  from  which,  by  heating  with  hydrobromic  acid  saturated  at 
+  6°,  propylene  dibromide  is  regenerated,  whilst  by  employment  of 
more  dilute  acid,  methyl  brom-acetol  (§  445),  CH3.CBr2.CH3,  is 
formed. 

Propylene  diiodide,  C3H6I2  =  CH3.CHI.CH2I,  obtained  by 
direct  union  of  iodine  and  propylene  at  a  temperature  of  50°-60°,  is 
a  colourless  oil  of  powerful  odour,  decomposing  on  distillation. 

Propylene  chloro-bromide,  CH3.CHBr.CH2Cl,  is  obtained  by 
heating  monobrom  propylene  with  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid. 
It  boils  at  11 2°-l  13°,  and  is  reconverted  into  monobrom  propylene 
by  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  : 

CH3.CHBr.CH2Cl  +  KOH  =  KC1  +  H20  +  CH3.CBr:CH2. 

The  isomeric  propylene  bromo-chloride,  CH3.CHCl.CH2Br,  is  ob- 
tained by  continued  boiling  of  propylene  dibromide  with  mercuric 
bromide  : 

2CH3.CHBr.CH2Br  +  HgCl2  =  HgBr2  +  2CH3.CHCl.CH2Br. 

It  boils  constantly  between  119°  and  120°,  and  yields  monochlor  pro- 
pylene on  boiling  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  : 

CH3.CHCl.CH2Br  +  KOH  =  KBr  +  OH2  +  CH3.CC1 :  CH2. 

On  heating  propylene  haloid  compounds  with  water  to  210°-220°  in 
sealed  glass  tubes,  there  is  obtained,  together  with  halogen  hydro- 
acid,  not,  as  might  have  been  expected,  propylene  oxide,  formed  by 
the  direct  replacement  of  the  halogen  by  an  atom  of  oxygen,  but  the 
compounds  isomeric  with  this,  acetone  and  propionic  aldehyde. 
Without  doubt  in  these  decompositions  it  is  not  both  hydrogen  atoms 
of  the  water  molecule  that  are  employed  to  form  the  halogen  hydro- 
acid,  but  only  one  of  them,  together  with  a  hydrogen  atom  of  the 
propylene;  so  that  the  process  proceeds  with  intermediate  phases 
in  the  following  way  : 

CH3.CHC1.CH2C1  +  HOH  =  HC1  +  CH3.CC1:CH2  +  HOH 

=  2HC1  +  CH3.CO.CH3, 

and  0H3.0HC1.CH2.C1  +  HOH  =  HC1  +  CH3.CH:CHC1 

+  HOH  =  2HC1  +  CH3.CH2.CHO. 

479.   Trimethene  dibromide,   CH2Br.CH2.CH2Br,    is   formed  by 

heating  allylic  bromide  with  hydrobromic  acid  (saturated  at  0°)  for  a 

short  time  to   100°  in  sealed  tubes.     Some  propylene  dibromide  is

boils  at  156°-159°,  but  has  probably  not  yet  been  obtained  quite 
pure.  The  bromine  compound  of  the  butylene  obtained  by  action  of 
zinc  diethyl  on  monobrom  ethylene  boils  at  166°. 

Pseudo-butylene  dibromide,  CH3.CHBr.CHBr.CH3,  obtained  from 
butylene  and  bromine,  boils  at  159°. 

Two  halogen  compounds  of  isobutylene  are  known.  The  dichloride, 
(CH3)2  :CC1.CH2C1,  boils  at  130°,  the  dibromide  at  149°.  Similarly 
to  the  propylene  dihaloids,  which  yield  propionic  aldehyde  on  boiling 
with  water,  isobutylene  dibromide  gives  isobutyric  aldehyde  :

300     DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  DIAD  ALCOHOL  RADICALS,  C^. 

Isoamylene  dichloride,  (CH3)2.CC1.CHC1.CH3,  is  a  colourless  dis- 
tillable  oil.  Isoamylene  dibromide,  (CH3)2.CBr.CHBr.CH3,  boils  with 
slight  decomposition  between  170°  and  175°,  and  yields  with  alcoholic 
potassic  hydrate  monobrom  amylene,  (CH3)2  :CH.CBr  :CH3,  whose 
boiling  point  is  112°. 

482.  The  dibromides  of  the  higher  members  of  the  series,  such  as 
hexylene,  octylene,  and  diamylene,  are  oily  liquids  which  decompose 
on  distillation.     Some  of  these  bodies  will  be  mentioned  later. 

The  Diacid  Alcohols  or  Glycols,  CnH2n(OH)2. 

483.  The  methods  used  for  preparing  the  glycols  or  dihydrates  of 
the  divalent  alcohol  radicals  vary  with  the  nature  of  these  bodies. 
In  most  cases  the  dihaloid  compounds  are  employed,  and  are  first 
converted  into  the  acetates. 

A  good  yield  is  obtained  by  employing  the  diiodides  or  dibromides 
of  the  olefines,  and  heating  them  with  argentic  acetate  in  presence  of 
glacial  acetic  acid : 

CnH2nI2  +  2AgO.C2H30  =  2AgI  +  CnH2n(O.C2H30)2. 

The  diacetate  is  first  purified  by  distillation,  and  then  saponified  by 
addition  of  just  the  requisite  quantity  of  alkali  : 

CnH2n(O.C2H30)2  +  2KOH  =  2KO.C2H30  +  CnH2n(OH)2. 

Another,  if  also  analogous,  way  consists  in  heating  the  dibromides 
or  dichlorides  of  the  olefines  with  alcohol  and  potassic  acetate  to  100°, 
until  the  reaction  is  complete.  There  is  then  formed  potassic  and 
ethylic  acetates  together  with  the  olefine  hydrate  acetate  : 

CnH2nBr2  +  HOC2H5  +  2KO.C2H30  =  2KBr  +  C2H50.C2H30 

+  CnH2n(OH)(O.C2H30), 

which  is  also  purified  by  rectification  and  then  decomposed  by  the 
requisite  quantity  of  strong  basic  hydrate,  and  the  glycol  separated  by 
fractional  distillation. 

The  double  tertiary  glycols  or  pinacones  are  prepared  from  the 
ketones  by  action  of  nascent  hydrogen. 

484.  The  glycols  are  mostly  syrupy  liquids,  the  lower  members 
mixing  in  all  proportions  with  water,  but,  like  the  alcohols, 
CnH2n+1.OH,  becoming  less  soluble  with  rise  in  molecular  weight. 
They  are  soluble  in  alcohol  without  exception,  mostly  also  in  ether. 
So  far  as  the  members  of  this  series  have  yet  been  obtained,  they 
distil  unaltered  and  generally  taste  sweet. 

By  action  of  hydrochloric  acid  gas  they  are  converted  into  mono- 
hydrate  chlorides  : 

CnH2n(OH)2  +  HC1  =  CnH2n<  qjj 

which  by  action  of  phosphoric  chloride  are  converted  into  the 
dichlorides  : 

CnH2n  |  ^H  +  PU15  =  POCl3  +  HC1  +  CnH2nCl2. 

Hydrobromic,  and  especially  hydriodic,  acids  convert  the  glycols 
with  greater  readiness  and  completely  into  the  respective  dihaloids. 


ETHYLENE   GLYCOL.  301 

By  heating  with  concentrated  hydriodic  acid  to    150°-200°   alkyl 
iodides  are  formed  : 

CnH2n(OH)2  +  3HI  =  20H2  +  I2  +  CnH2n+1I, 
and  even  paraffins  : 

CnH2n(OH)2  +  4HI  =  2H20  +  2I2  +  CnH2n+2. 

Ethylene  Glycol,  C2H602  =  C2H4(OH)2. 

485.  To  obtain  ethylene  dihydrate  or  ethylene  glycol,  frequently 
also  termed  glycol,  either  ethylene  diacetate,  boiling  at  187°,  is  pre- 
pared by  heating  ethylene  diiodide  with  argentic  acetate  in  presence 
of  glacial  acetic  acid  at  100°  :

CH2I  CH2.O.C2H30 

or  ethylene  hydrate  acetate  (boiling  at  182°)  is  prepared  from  ethylene 
dichloride  or  dibromide,  alcohol,  and  potassic  acetate  :

+    I 

CH2.O.C2H30 

In  employing  this  latter,  generally  preferable,  method,  equal  parts 
of  potassic  acetate  and  ethylene  dibromide  are  placed  in  a  thick-walled 
flask — e.g.  champagne  bottles — two  parts  of  alcohol  are  then  added,  and, 
after  securing  the  cork  in  its  place,  are  heated  for  several  hours  on  the 
water  bath.  If  ethylene  chloride  be  employed,  the  proportions  must  be 
altered  to  one  part  of  this,  two  parts  of  potassic  acetate,  and  four 
parts  of  alcohol. 

After  cooling  the  heated  mixture  much  potassic  chloride  or  bro- 
mide is  found  to  have  crystallised  out ;  the  alcoholic  solution  is 
filtered,  the  alcohol  and  ethylic  acetate  distilled  off,  and  that  portion 
passing  over  at  higher  temperatures  submitted  to  fractional  distilla- 
tion. To  that  passing  over  between  140°  and  200°,  mostly  ethylene 
hydrate  acetate,  a  hot  concentrated  solution  of  potassic  hydrate  is 
slowly  added,  until  a  distinctly  alkaline  reaction  is  obtained  after 
long  shaking.  Carbonic  anhydride  is  then  passed  in  to  convert  the 
free  alkali  into  carbonate,  and  the  whole  submitted  to  distillation. 
Water  first  passes  over.  Ethylene  glycol  is  obtained  by  repeated 
fractionation  from  that  portion  distilling  above  100°. 

Instead  of  potassic  hydrate,  the  saponification  may  be  effected  in 
similar  manner  by  hot  saturated  solution  of  baric  hydrate.  After 
precipitation  of  the  excess  of  baric  hydrate  by  carbonic  anhydride, 
the  whole  is  evaporated  as  far  as  possible  on  the  water  bath,  the 
baric  acetate  precipitated  from  the  residue  by  addition  of  absolute 
alcohol,  and  the  glycol  separated  from  the  alcoholic  filtrate  by  frac- 
tional distillation. 

Ethylene  glycol  can  be  obtained  in  one  operation  from  ethylene 
dibromide,  when  molecular  weights  of  it  and  of  potassic  acetate  are 
heated  with  double  the  weight  of  alcohol  in  a  vessel  provided  with 


302      DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  DIAD  ALCOHOL  RADICALS,  CH^. 

an  inverted  condenser,  and  the  filtered  liquid  submitted  to  fractional 
distillation.  About  one-half  of  the  bromide  is  obtained  unchanged, 
the  other  half  in  great  part  as  ethylene  glycol.  Undoubtedly  ethylene 
bromide  acetate  is  first  formed  : 

2C2H4Br2  +  2KO.C2H30  =  2KBr  +  2C2H4Br(O.C2H30), 

which  is  resolved  by  the  alcohol  present  into  ethylic  acetate,  ethylene 
dibromide,  and  glycol  : 

2C2H4Br(OC2H30)  +  2C2H5.OH  =  C2H4Br2  +  2C2H5.O.C2H30 

+  C2H4(OH)2. 

486.  Ethylene  glycol  is  a  colourless  liquid,  of  about  the  consistence 
of  a  thin  syrup,  of  sweet  and  alcoholic  taste,  and  scarcely  any  smell. 
Its  sp.  gr.  is  1*125  at  0°,  the  vapour  density  2'164.  Its  boiling  point 
is  197°. 

It  mixes  with  water  and  alcohol  in  every  proportion,  but  is  less 
soluble  in  ether.     Sodium  dissolves  in  it,  with  evolution  of  hydrogen, 

{OH 
^^   ,  corresponding  to  sodic  ethylate,  being 

first  formed  as  a  solid  white  mass.  By  heating  to  190°  with  as  much 
sodium  again,  this  is  converted,  though  completely  only  with  difficulty, 
into  disodic  ethylenate,  C2H4(ONa)2.  Like  the  sodium  derivatives  of 
theCnH2n+1  alcohols,  both  these  bodies  are  decomposed  by  water, 
yielding  glycol  and  sodic  hydrate. 

487.  Ethylene  glycol,  as  a  diprimary  alcohol,  is  capable  of 
similar  oxidation  to  the  primaiy  monacid  alcohols ;  only  this  can  be 
repeated  twice.  The  first  stage  of  oxidation  that  might  have  been 
expected  : 

CH2.OH  CHa.OH 

|  +  0  =  H20  +     | 

CH2.OH  CH:0 

has  not  yet  been  realised,  the  oxidation  always  proceeding  beyond  this 
point.  If  two  oxygen  atoms  act  on  a  molecule  of  glycol,  glycollic 
acid  is  formed  : 

CH2.OH  CH2.OH 

+  20  =  H20  +  (glycollic  acid) 

CH2.OH  CO.OH 

which  is  related  to  glycol  as  acetic  acid  is  to  ethyl  alcohol. 

By  the  same  proportion  of  the  ingredients  the  double  aldehyde 
glyoxal  is  also  readily  formed  : 

CH2.OH       O       H20       CH:0 
|  +       =  +|  (glyoxal) 

CH2.OH       O       H20       CH:0 
Both  oxidation  products  are  converted  by  further  oxidation  into  an 
aldehydic  acid,  glyoxylic  acid  : 

CH2.OH       0  CHO 

+       =  H20  +  I  (glyoxylic  acid)

1.  Propylene  glycol,  or  a-oxypropylic  alcohol,  is  prepared  from  pro- 
pylene dibromide.  By  decomposition  with  argentic  acetate  the  di- 
acetate,  boiling  at  186°,  is  first  obtained,  and  from  this,  on  saponifi- 
cation, the  alcohol.  This  latter  is  colourless,  syrupy,  and  of  sweet 
taste ;  its  sp.  gr.  at  0°  is  1*051,  its  boiling  point  188°,  and  the  vapour 
density  2'596. 

By  oxidation  of  propylene  glycol  diluted  with  water,  by  means  of 
platinum  black  and  oxygen,  it  behaves  as  though  only  a  monhydric 
primary  alcohol  yielding  an  acid  of  like  carbon  contents — ethylidene

only  three  have  yet  been  obtained.     They  are 

1.  a-Butene  glycol,  CH3.CH2.CH(OH).CH2.OH,  is  obtained  from 
the  dibromide  of  normal  butylene.  It  is  a  syrupy  liquid  boiling  at 
192°,  of  sp.  gr.  1*0189,  and  on  oxidation  yields  glycollic  and  gly- 
oxylic  acids. 

2.  fi-Butene  glycol,  or  (3-oxybutylic  alcohol  : 

CH3.CH(OH).CH2.CH2.OH. 

This  compound  is  obtained,  together  with  ethylic  alcohol,  by  the  action 
of  sodium  amalgam  upon  acetic  aldehyde.  The  aldehyde  for  this 
purpose  is  distilled  with  three  to  six  times  its  volume  of  water,  and 
one  per  cent,  sodium  amalgam  slowly  added,  the  liquid  being  kept 
nearly  acid  by  addition  of  hydrochloric  acid  in  small  quantities.  The 
liquid  at  the  close  of  the  reaction  is  poured  off  from  the  mercury, 
neutralised  with  sodic  hydrate,  and  everything  volatile  below  100° 
distilled  off,  the  residue  shaken  with  ether  to  remove  other  products, 
and  the  aqueous  layer  evaporated  as  far  as  possible  on  the  water  bath. 
Strong  alcohol  is  then  added  to  precipitate  sodic  chloride,  and  the 
filtered  liquid  submitted  to  distillation.  /3-Butene  glycol  passes  over 
at  203'5°-204°.  It  is  a  colourless,  sweet-tasting,  viscid  liquid,  which 
mixes  with  water  and  alcohol,  but  is  not  perceptibly  soluble  in  ether. 
Nitric  acid" and  chromic  acid  oxidise  it  to  acetic  acid,  oxalic  acid, 
carbonic  anhydride,  crotonic  aldehyde,  with  some  acetic  aldehyde  :

between  183°  and  184°,  and  has  at  0°  the  sp.  gr.  1-048.  It  is  con-

490.  Only  three  of  the  numerous  possible  isomeric  pentene  glycols 
are  known,  namely  : 

a-Pseudo-amylene  glycol,  CH3.CH2.CH(OH).CH(OH).CH3,  pre- 
pared from  the  dibromide  of  ethyl-methyl  methene,  boils  at  188°  and 
has  sp.  gr.  *9945. 

a-Isoamylene  glycol,  (CH3)2CH.CH(OH).CH2OH,  obtained  from 
the  dibromide  of  the  isoamylene  (§  467,  4),  is  a  thick  liquid,  boiling  at 
206°  and  of  sp.  gr.  -9987. 

^-Isoamylene  glycol,  (CH3)2:C(OH)CH(OH).CH3,  obtained  from 
isoamylene  dibromide  in  the  way  already  frequently  mentioned,  and 
also  by  the  direct  combination  of  isoamylene  with  hydric  peroxide  :

It  is  a  bitter-tasting,  syrupy  liquid,  which  boils  at  177°  and  has  at  0° 
the  sp.  gr.  '987.  It  dissolves  in  water,  alcohol,  and  ether,  and  on 
oxidation  yields  oxyisobutyric  acid,  (CH3)2.C(OH).CO.OH. 

Hexene  Glycols,  C6H12.(OH)2. 

491.  1.  A  hexylene  glycol  is  obtained  from  the  dibromide  of  the 
hexylene  mentioned  in  §  468  as  obtained  from  a- normal  secondary 
hexylic  iodide.  It  is  a  thick  liquid,  miscible  with  water,  of  -967 
sp.  gr.  and  207°  boiling  point. 

2.  Diallyl    dihydrate   is   probably   a   double    secondary   normal

hexene  glycol  of  the  formula  CH3.CH(OH).CH2.CH2.CH(OH).CH3. 
To  prepare  it  diallyl  is  heated  for  several  hours  with  concentrated 
hydriodic  acid,  whereby  it  unites  with  two  molecules  of  HI,  and  is 
converted  into  diallyl  dihydroiodide,  C6Hi2I2  : 

CH2:CH.CH2.CH2.CH:CH2+2HI  =  CH3.CHLCH2.CH2.CHLCH3. 

This  reacts  with  argentic  acetate  even  in  the  cold,  forming  the  corre- 
sponding diacetate,  which  boils  at  225°-230°,  and  on  saponification  with 
alkali  yields  diallyl  dihydrate  as  a  colourless  thick  syrup,  which  has 
at  0°  sp.  gr.  -9638,  boils  between  212°  and  215°,  and  mixes  with 
water,  alcohol,  and  ether.  By  heating  with  concentrated  hydrochloric 
acid  it  yields  its  dichloride,  the  so-called  diallyl  dihydrochloride  : 

CH3.CHC1.CH2.CH2.CHC1.CH3, 

which  is  also  obtained  by  the  direct  union  of  diallyl  with  hydrochloric 
acid  as  an  oil  boiling  between  170°  and  180°. 

On  oxidation  diallyl  dihydrate  yields  only  acetic  and  carbonic  acids. 

3.  Pinacone,  (CH3)2 :  C(OH).C(OH) :  (CH3)2,  is  the  double  tertiary 
alcohol  of  the  formula  C6H12(OH)2.  It  is  obtained,  together  with  iso- 
propylic  alcohol,  by  the  action  of  nascent  hydrogen  upon  acetone,  and 
is  formed  especially  when  the  acetone  is  employed  in  considerable

To  prepare  this  body  acetone  is  poured  upon  a  large  quantity  of  a 
half  saturated  solution  of  potassic  carbonate,  and  sodium  added  in 
pieces  about  the  size  of  a  pea.  These  sink  through  the  layer  of  ace- 
tone, and  on  reaching  the  aqueous  solution  evolve  hydrogen,  which  is 
completely  fixed  by  the  acetone.  One  part  of  sodium  is  employed  to 
about  three  parts  of  acetone.  When  the  reaction  is  completed  the 
upper  layer  is  submitted  to  distillation,  and  about  one  and  a  half  per 
cent,  of  crude  isopropylic  alcohol  is  obtained  below  100°.  At  higher 
temperatures  pinacone  passes  over,  and  is  obtained  on  cooling  as  a 
crystalline  mass.  To  purify  it,  it  is  dissolved  in  water  and  evaporated, 
when  it  separates  in  large  quadratic  tables,  C6H12(OH)2,6H20,  melt- 
ing at  42°,  and  which  lose  their  water  of  crystallisation  slowly  in 
dry  air.  On  distillation  water  first  passes  over,  and  later,  at  about 
170°,  anhydrous  pinacone.  This  latter  is  a  colourless  crystalline  mass, 
which  melts  at  38°  and  boils  between  171°  and  172°.  By  phosphoric 
oxychloride  pinacone  is  converted  into  the  corresponding  dichloride, 
(CH3)2:C-C1 

,  a  crystalline  mass  melting  at  160°. 
(CH3)2:C— CI 

492.  Of  higher  molecular  glycols  only  octylene  glycol,  prepared  from 
fche  dibromide  of  caprylene  (§  469),  is  sufficiently  known  to  be  worth 
mention.  It  is  a  colourless  liquid  miscible  with  alcohol  and  ether, 
insoluble  in  water,  of  "932  sp.  gr.,  and  boiling  at  235°-240°. 


HALOID  HYDRATES.  307 

Haloid  Hydrates  of  the  Glycol  Radicals. 

493.  On  passing  hydrochloric  gas  into  an  define  glycol,  one  of 
the  hydrogen  groups  is  first  replaced  by  chlorine  : 

CnH2n(OH)2  +  HC1  =  CnH2n  |  gjg.  +  H20. 

The  corresponding  replacement  of  the  second  hydroxyl  group  occurs 
with  far  greater  difficulty,  but,  as  previously  mentioned  (§  484),  can 
be  effected  by  phosphoric  chloride.  Hydriodic  acids  react  more 
vigorously,  forming  the  diiodide  from  the  glycol. 

Other  methods  of  preparing  the  hydrate  haloids  depend  on  the 
direct  union  of  the  halogen  hydro-acids  to  the  acids  of  the  glycol 
radicals,  and  on  the  power  of  the  defines  of  iiniting  directly  with 
hypochlorous  acid  : 

CnH2n  +  C10H  =  CnH2n(OH)Cl. 

494.  By  action  of  alkaline  solutions  the  haloid  hydrates  are  not 
reconverted  into  glycols,  but  into  the  anhydrous  oxides  of  the  glycol 
radicals  : 

CnH2n  |  ^H  +  KOH  =  KC1  +  H20  +  CnH2n  :0. 

These  anhydrous  oxides  unite  very  readily  with  halogen  hydro-acids, 
and  are  thereby  reconverted  into  haloid  hydrates  : 

CnH2n :  0  +  HBr  =  CnH2n  {  ^ 

To  obtain  the  glycols  from  these  latter,  they  must  first  be  con- 
verted into  hydrate  acetates  by  heating  with  potassic  acetate  : 

CnH2n  |  gg-  +  KO.C2H30  =  KC1  +  CnH2n  j  q^2^0 

and  afterwards  saponified. 

By  treatment  with  sodium  amalgam  and  water  the  hydrate 
haloids  yield  the  monovalent  alcohols  : 

CnH2nC1.0H  +  Na2  +  H20  =  NaCl  +  NaOH  +  CnH2n+1.OH. 

495.  The  ethylene  hydrate  haloids  are  the  best  known.

In  employing  the  latter  method  chlorine  gas  is  passed  into  ice-cold

hexene  glycol  of  the  formula  CH3.CH(OH).CH2.CH2.CH(OH).CH3. 
To  prepare  it  diallyl  is  heated  for  several  hours  with  concentrated 
hydriodic  acid,  whereby  it  unites  with  two  molecules  of  HI,  and  is 
converted  into  diallyl  dihydroiodide,  C6H12I2  : 

CH2:CH.OH2.CH2.CH:CH2+2HI  =  CH3.CHI.CH2.CH2.CHI.CH3. 

This  reacts  with  argentic  acetate  even  in  the  cold,  forming  the  corre- 
sponding diacetate,  which  boils  at  225°-230°,  and  on  saponification  with 
alkali  yields  diallyl  dihydrate  as  a  colourless  thick  syrup,  which  has 
at  0°  sp.  gr.  -9638,  boils  between  212°  and  215°,  and  mixes  with 
water,  alcohol,  and  ether.  By  heating  with  concentrated  hydrochloric 
acid  it  yields  its  dichloride,  the  so-called  diallyl  dihydrochloride  : 

CH3.CHC1.CH2.CH2.CHC1.CH3, 

which  is  also  obtained  by  the  direct  union  of  diallyl  with  hydrochloric 
acid  as  an  oil  boiling  between  170°  and  180°. 

On  oxidation  diallyl  dihydrate  yields  only  acetic  and  carbonic  acids. 

3.  Pinacone,  (CH3)2 :  C(OH).C(OH) :  (CH3)2,  is  the  double  tertiary 
alcohol  of  the  formula  C6H12(OH)2.  It  is  obtained,  together  with  iso- 
propylic  alcohol,  by  the  action  of  nascent  hydrogen  upon  acetone,  and 
is  formed  especially  when  the  acetone  is  employed  in  considerable

HALOID  HYDKATES.  307 

Haloid  Hydrates  of  the  Glycol  Radicals. 

493.  On  passing  hydrochloric  gas  into  an  define  glycol,  one  of 
the  hydrogen  groups  is  first  replaced  by  chlorine  : 

CnH2n(OH)2  +  HC1  =  CnH2n  |  ^H  +  H20. 

The  corresponding  replacement  of  the  second  hydroxyl  group  occurs 
with  far  greater  difficulty,  but,  as  previously  mentioned  (§  484),  can 
be  effected  by  phosphoric  chloride.  Hydriodic  acids  react  more 
vigorously,  forming  the  diiodide  from  the  glycol. 

Other  methods  of  preparing  the  hydrate  haloids  depend  on  the 
direct  union  of  the  halogen  hydro-acids  to  the  acids  of  the  glycol 
radicals,  and  on  the  power  of  the  olefines  of  uniting  directly  with 
hypochlorous  acid  : 

CnH2n  +  C10H  =  CnH2n(OH)Cl. 

494.  By  action  of  alkaline  solutions  the  haloid  hydrates  are  not 
reconverted  into  glycols,  but  into  the  anhydrous  oxides  of  the  glycol 
radicals  : 

CnH2n  |  ^H  +  KOH  =  KC1  +  H20  +  CnH2n:0. 

These  anhydrous  oxides  unite  very  readily  with  halogen  hydro-acids, 
and  are  thereby  reconverted  into  haloid  hydrates  :

To  obtain  the  glycols  from  these  latter,  they  must  first  be  con-

and  afterwards  saponified. 

By  treatment  with  sodium  amalgam  and  water  the  hydrate

liquid  is  then  neutralised  with  sodic  hydrate  and  submitted  to  dis-

chloro-hydrate  is  then  removed  from  the  distillate  by  shaking  with

CH2.O.N02 

Ethylene  dinitrate,    ,  ,  is  easily  obtained   by    pouring 

CH2.O.N02 
one  part  of  ethylene  glycol  into  an  ice-cold  mixture  of  two  and  a  half 
parts  of  concentrated  nitric  acid  and  five  parts  of  sulphuric  acid. 
Addition  of  water  precipitates  the  nitrate  as  a  heavy  oil  of  unpleasant 
sweet  taste ;  this  is  then  washed  with  sodic  hydrate  and  dried  by 
calcic  chloride.  On  heating  it  burns  with  strong  detonation  and 
luminous  flame.  Potassic  hydrate  readily  saponifies  it,  yielding 
glycol  and  potassic  nitrate. 

Ethylene  hydrate  sulphate,  HO.CH2.CH2.O.S02.OH,  is  formed, 
similarly  to  the  monalkyl  sulphates,  on  gentle  heating  of  ethylene 
glycol  and  concentrated  sulphuric  acid.  The  product  is  diluted  with 
water,  saturated  with  baric  carbonate,  and  the  filtered  solution 
evaporated  to  crystallisation.  The  salt,  (HO.CH2.CH2.O.S02.0)2Ba, 
so  obtained  gives,  on  boiling  with  baric  hydrate,  a  precipitate  of 
baric  sulphate,  ethylene  glycol  remaining  in  solution.

two  or  also  with  only  one  SH  group,  though  self-evidently  in  the 
last  case  saturation  must  be  completed  by  other  elements. 

These  bodies  can  be  prepared,  similarly  to  the  mercaptans  of  the 
alkyls  (§  237),  by  heating  the  respective  haloids  with  potassic  sulph- 
hydrate.  The  hydrogen  atom  in  union  with  sulphur  is  readily  re- 
placed by  heavy  metals.  Oxidising  agents  convert  them  into  ethy- 
lene sulphonic  acids,  the  group  SH  being  oxidised  to  S02.OH.

pose the  ethionic  acid.  The  solution  contains,  together  with  some 
methionic  acid  (§  419),  isethionic  acid  and  sulphuric  acid.  The 
latter  is  removed  on  saturating  with  baric  carbonate.  The  liquid 
filtered  at  the  boiling  point  first  yields,  on  cooling,  crystals 
of  baric  methionate,  and  later,  on  evaporation,  baric  isethionate, 
(HO.CH2.CH2.S02.0)2Ba.  If  the  solution  of  the  latter  be  precipi 
tated  by  sufficient  sulphuric  acid,  and  the  filtrate  evaporated,  isethio- 
nic acid  is  obtained  in  strongly  acid  deliquescent  needle*. 

The  isethionates,  which  can  be  prepared  from  the  baric  salt  by 
addition  of  the  respective  metallic  sulphates,  are  readily  soluble  in 
water,  less  in  alcohol,  crystallise  well,  and  in  most  cases  can  be 
heated  to  350°  without  decomposition.

amines,  the  reactions  being  violent :

They  are,  therefore,  half  alcohols  and  half  animes. 

In  order  to  separate  the  compounds  simultaneously  formed,  the 
varying  solubility  of  their  hydrochlorides  and  platino-chlorides  is 
made  use  of.  The  mixture,  after  addition  of  hydrochloric  acid,  is  eva- 
porated as  far  as  possible  to  dryness,  whereby  triethylene  hydrate 
amnionic  chloride,  N(C2H4.OH)3.H01,  partly  crystallises  out  in 
prisms,  whilst  diethylene  hydrate  and  monethylene  hydrate  amnionic 
chlorides  cannot  be  obtained  in  the  solid  state.  The  first  is  insoluble 
in  absolute  alcohol,  which  dissolves  both  the  others;  the  alcoholic 
solution  is  then  mixed  with  platinic  chloride.  The  double  salt  of 
diethylene  hydrate  amnionic  chloride,  [N(C2H4.OH)2H2Cl]2PtCl4, 
crystallising  in  prisms,  first  separates,  whilst  that  of  ethylene  hydrate 
amnionic  chloride,  [N(C2H4.OH)H3Cl]2PtCl4,  is  precipitated  later  on 
addition  of  ether.  The  platino-chlorides  are  separated,  dissolved  in 
water,  and  the  platinum  precipitated  by  hydric  sulphide.  On  evapora- 
tion the  hydrochlorides  are  obtained,  which  by  treatment  with  moist 
argentic  oxide  yield  the  free  bases.  The  latter  are  strongly  alkaline 
syrups,  which  dissolve  in  alcohol.

This  strongly  alkaline  ammonium  base  was  first  found  in  the  bile, 
later  prepared  under  the  name  neurine  from  the  brain,  and  also  occurs 
widely  diffused  in  organic  nature  as  '  sincaline!  Neurine  does  not 
occur  as  such  in  the  organism,  but  in  combination  forming  lecithine,  a 
fatty  substance,  which  yields  neurine  as  a  product  of  its  resolution 
into  simpler  bodies. 

In  order  to  prepare  choline,  ox  brain  is  generally  employed.  This 
is  finely  divided,  and  extracted  first  by  frequent  shaking  with  ether 
and  then  with  warm  alcohol.  The  ether  and  alcohol  are  then  eva- 
porated off,  and  the  residue  boiled  for  about  an  hour  with  excess  of 
solution  of  baric  hydrate.  Excess  of  baric  hydrate  is  then  removed 
by  passing  carbonic  anhydride,  the  liquid  boiled,  filtered,  and  the  clear 
aqueous  liquid  evaporated  to  a  syrup  on  the  water  bath.  This  is  ex 
tracted  with  absolute  alcohol,  the  filtered  solution  treated  with  slight 
excess  of  hydrochloric  acid  and  precipitated  with  platinic  chloride. 
The  clear  yellow  precipitate  of  platino-chloride  is  then  dissolved  in 
water,  freed  from  platinum  by  hydric  sulphide,  and  finally  crystalline 
choline  hydrochloride,  X(CH3)3(C2H4.0H).C1,  obtained  by  evaporation 
in  a  dry  vacuum.  This,  on  treatment  with  moist  argentic  oxide,  yields 
an  aqueous  solution  of  free  neurine  : 

N(CH3)3(C2H4.0H)C1  +  AgOH  =  AgCl  +  N(CH3)3(C2H4.OH)OH, 

which,  on  complete  evaporation,  forms  a  caustic,  alkaline,  difficultly 
soluble  svrup,  which  absorbs  water  and  carbonic  anhydride  from  the 
air.  The  platino-chloride,  [N(CH3)3(C2H4.OH)Cl]2PtCl4,  crystallises 
from  its  aqueous  solution  in  beautiful  reddish  yellow  tables.  Accord- 
ing to  some  authors,  the  base  obtained  from  nervous  tis.-ue  is  not 
choline,  but  trimztftyl '  vinylammonic  hydrate,  which  they  then  term 
ivuriM.  But,  as  hydrochloric  acid  is  employed  in  the  preparation,  it 
may  readily  have  occurred  that  trimethyl-ethylene  chloride  amnionic 
chloride  may  have  been  formed,  which  would  yield  the  vinyl  base 
when  treated  with  argentic  oxide. 

Choline  is  obtained  synthetically  by  the  action  of  ethylene  hydrate 
chloride  or  of  ethylene  oxide  and  water  on  trimethylamine :

Nitryl  Compounds  of  the  Olefines. 

529.  Compounds  of  the  glycol  radicals  with  nitryl,  (N02),  have 
only  as  yet  been  obtained  from  the  olefines  by  action  of  concentrated 
nitric  acid  or  by  direct  union  with  nitric  peroxide. 

Ethylene  dinitryl,  C2H4N204,  is  most  readily  obtained  when  dry 
ethylene  gas  is  passed  into  anhydrous  ether,  to  which,  at  the  same 
time,  liquid  nitric  peroxide  is  added  drop  by  drop : 
C2H4  +  N204  =  C2H4(N02)2. 


PHOSPHORUS  AND  ARSENIC    COMPOUNDS.  325 

Colourless  prisms  or  tables  of  ethylene  dinitryl  separate,  which  melt  at 
37-5°,  and  volatilise  at  slightly  higher  temperature  (with  especial 
readiness  in  an  atmosphere  of  ethylene  gas). 

Isoamylene  dinitryl,  C5H10(NO2)2,  is  obtained  by  passing  nitric 
peroxide  vapour  into  isoamylene,  or  isoamylene  vapour  into  red  fuming 
nitric  acid.  It  crystallises  in  rectangular  tables,  which  decompose  at 
95°,  but  sublime  slowly  below  this  temperature. 

Phosphorus  and  Arsenic  Compounds  of  Ethylene. 

530.  Triethyi  phosphine  and  triethyl  arsine  behave  towards  ethy- 
lene haloids  in  similar  manner  to  the  trialkylamines  (§  522). 

1.  If  triethyl-phosphine  be  left  for  a  long  time  with  ethylene 
dibromide  at  ordinary  temperatures,  it  yields  mainly 

Triethyl-ethylene  bromo-phosphonic  bromide  : 

C8H19PBr2  =  P(C2H5)3(CH2.CH2Br)Br, 

crystallising  from  water  and  alcohol  n  rhombic  dodecahedrons.  On 
addition  of  argentic  nitrate  half  the  bromine  is  precipitated,  whilst  the 
nitrate,  P(C2H5)3(C2H4Br)O.N02,  remains  in  solution.  The  latter  is 
converted  by  hydrochloric  acid  into  the  chloride,  P(C2H5)3(C2H4Br)Cl, 
which  gives  with  platinic  chloride  a  difficultly  soluble  double  salt, 
crystallising  in  long  prisms. 

If  the  original  bromide  be  heated,  either  alone  or  with  argentic 
salts,  it  loses  hydrobromic  acid  from  the  ethylene  bromide  group,  and 
yields  derivatives  of  triethyl-vinyl  phosphonium  \  on  heating  to  240°, 
e.g.,  a  residue  of  triethyl-vinyl  phosphonic  bromide,  P(C2H5)3(C2H3)Br, 
remains. 

If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  first  bromide  be  heated  in  dilute  solution 
with  argentic  oxide,  both  bromine  atoms  are  replaced  by  hydroxyl, 
and  the  strongly  alkaline  base  triethyl-ethylene  hydrate  phosphonic  hy- 
drate, P(C2H5)3(CH2.CH2.OH)OH,  is  obtained. 

2.  An  excess  of  triethyl-phosphine  is  converted  by  ethylene  di- 
bromide into 

CH2.P(02H5)3Br 
Hexethyl- ethylene  diphosphonic  dibromide,  |  .    This 

CH2.P(C2H5)3Br 

crystallises  in  colourless  needles  readily  soluble  in  alcohol  and  water. 
By  moist  argentic  oxide  it  is  converted  into 

CH2.P(C2H5)3OH 
Hexethyl-ethylene  diphosphonic  dihydrate,    j  ,   a 

CH2.P(C2H3)3OH 

strongly  caustic,  deliquescent  mass.  Triethyl-ethylene  bromide 
phosphonic  bromide  also  gives  analogous  derivatives  with  trialkyl 
phosphines  :

Metallic  Compounds  of  Ethylene. 

533.  Glycol  derivatives  corresponding  to  the  large  group  of 
metallic  compounds  of  the  monad  alcohol  radicals  are  not  known. 
Their  preparation  has  in  part  been  attempted  without  result.  Only 
ethylene  forms  some  derivatives  in  which  it  is  at  least  in  part  united 
to  metals,  especially  platinum  and  iron. 

Ethylene  platinum  Chloride,  C2H4PtCl2,  is  formed  by  heating  a 
solution  of  platinic  chloride  with  alcohol,  or  by  passing  ethylene  gas 
into  a  hydrochloric  acid  solution  of  platinous  chloride  :

It  is  a  clear  yellow  mass,  whose  aqueous  solution  yields  compounds 
with  ammonic  and  potassic  chlorides,  crystallising  in  rhombic  prisms. 


METALLIC   COMPOUNDS.  327 

The  latter,  C2H4PtCl2,KCl,H20,  yields  on  heating  ethylene  gas,  whilst 
potassic  platinous  chloride  remains.  Propylene  and  isoamylene  also 
yield  similar  compounds  j  C3H6PtCl2,KCl,rI20  crystallises  in  yellow 
tables;  C5H10PtCl2,KCl,H2O,  in  golden  yellow  scales  resembling 
plumbic  iodide. 

Ethylene  iron  chloride,  C2H4FeCl2,2H20.  This  body  is  obtained 
on  heating  a  solution  of  ferric  chloride  in  ether  to  140°-150°,  better  if 
some  phosphorus  dissolved  in  carbonic  disulphide  be  added,  the  heat 
of  the  water  bath  then  sufficing.  The  liquid  fills  with  hard,  nearly 
colourless  crystals  of  the  above  formula.  These  become  somewhat 
damp  in  the  air,  and  oxidise,  turning  yellow.  They  dissolve  readily 
in  water,  and  lose  their  water  of  crystallisation  at  100°.  Their  whole 
behaviour  characterises  them  as  a  ferrous  compound,  so  that  their

TRIPLE    SUBSTITUTION    PRODUCTS    OF    THE 
PARAFFINS. 

Derivatives  of  the  Trivalent  Radicals,  CnHan^. 

5154.  The  replacement  of  three  hydrogen  atoms  in  a  paraffin  by 
other  elements  or  compound  radicals  yields,  in  accordance  with  the 
chemical  position  of  the  replacement,  the  following  groups  of  com- 
pounds : — 

1 .  If  the  three  substitution  positions  are  on  a  single,  necessarily 
terminal  carbon  atom,  there  occur  derivatives  of  the  hydrocarbon 
radical :

The    first    member    of    the   series   is    the   mono-carbonide  formyl

2.  If  two  substitution  positions  occur  on  one,  the  third  on  a  second 
carbon  atom,  two  cases  may  occur. 

a.  The  double  replacement  occurs,  as  in  the  aldehydes,  on  a  ter- 
minal carbon  atom  :

The  compounds  of  this  class  are  those  of  the  mono-substituted  alde-

All  compounds  of  this  class  must  contain  more  than  two  carbon

3.  If,  finally,  all  these  substitution  positions  occur  on  three  different 
carbon  atoms,  there  result  derivatives  of  the  trivalent  alcohol  radicals, 
whose  first  member  is  the  tricarbonide  glyceryl  or  allyl :

535.  The  first  member  of  this  series,  strictly  speaking,  is  the  radical 
of  acetic  acid,  CH3.C  j  (acetyl),  but  that  of  formic  acid,  H.C  \  (formyl), 
shows  such  analogy  that  it  must  be  included  in  the  group.  Up  to  the 
tricarbon  radical  of  propionic  acid,  CH3.CH2.C  \ ,  no  isomerism  occurs,

Their  number  is  always  equal  to  the  number  of  primary  alcohols  of

536.  By  far  the  larger  number  of  the  acid  radical  derivatives  con- 
tain an  oxygen  atom  in  divalent  union,  oxidised  radicals,  CnH2n  +  i-CO, 
acidoxyls,  thereby  resulting,  whose  hydrates  are  the  monobasic  organic 
acids,  Cn'H2n'+1.CO.OH.  In  these  hydrates  not  only  the  halogen 
atom,  but  also  the  whole  hydroxyl  group  is  readily  replaced  by  other 
elements,  whilst  the  oxygen  atom  in  chad  union  is  only  eliminated 
or  replaced  with  difficulty. 

Halogen  and  Nitryl  Compounds. 

537.  The  number  of  known  halogen  compounds  of  the  acidyl 
residue  CnH2n  _  x  is  veiy  small,  consisting  of  the  trihaloids  of  formyl 
and  acetyl. 

The  trichlorides  and  tribromides  are  obtained  directly  by  the  action 
of  the  respective  halogens  upon  the  paraffins,  but  are  more  readily 
prepared  from  the  chlorides  and  bromides  of  the  respective  primary 
alcohols  and  the  dihaloids  of  the  aldehyde  radicals  :

Cn,H2n,+  1.CHCl2  +  Cl2  =  Cn.H2n,+  1.CCl3  +  HC1. 

They  can  be  partly  obtained  from  the  acidoxyl  chlorides, 
Cn'H2ir+  i.COCl,  by  heating  with  excess  of  phosphoric  chloride  : 

Cn,H2n,+  1.COCl  +  PC15  =  POCI3  +  Cn,H2n.+  1.CCl3. 

The  yield,  however,  is  but  small,  the  high  temperature  required  for 
the  reaction  leading  to  further  decompositions. 

Formyl  Compounds. 

538.  Formyl  trichloride,  or  chloroform,  CHC13,  trichlor  methane. 
Chloroform  is  obtained  by  the  direct  action  of  chlorine  gas  on  methane, 
methylic  chloride,  and  methene  dichloride,  and  further  by  the  dis- 
tillation of  wood  spirit,  alcohol,  acetone,  acetates,  and  several  other 
organic  bodies  with  chloride  of  lime,  also,  together  with  potassic  for- 
mate, by  heating  chloral  with  solution  of  potassic  hydrate  : 

CCI3.CHO  +  HOK  =  CC13H  +  CHO.OK. 

The  latter  method  has  been  employed  of  late  for  the  manufacture 
of  pure  chloroform  ;  in  large  quantity  it  is  still  obtained  from  alcohol. 
For  this  purpose  three  parts  of  alcohol,  100  parts  of  water,  and  fifty 
parts  of  chloride  of  lime  are  submitted  to  distillation.  In  the  receiver, 
which  must  be  kept  well  cooled,  two  layers  of  liquid  collect,  the  under 
consisting  mainly  of  chloroform.  This  is  shaken  with  water  and  then 
purified  by  distillation  over  concentrated  sulphuric  acid. 

Chloroform  is  a  colourless,  strongly  refractive  liquid,  not  miscible 
with  water,  of  sp.  gr.  1'52  at  0°,  boiling  point  61°,  and  of  vapour 
density  4"  199.  It  is  uninflammable  in  air,  has  an  agreeable  odour,  a 
sweet  taste,  and  on  long  inhaling  of  its  vapour  produces  loss  of  con- 
sciousness and  insensibility  to  pain.  It  is  therefore  employed  as  an 
anaesthetic  agent. 

Chloroform  is  further  employed  as  a  solvent  for  fats,  resins,  caout- 
chouc, <fec.  Sulphur,  phosphorus,  and  iodine  also  dissolve  in  it,  the 
latter  with  violet  colour. 

Ammonia  converts  chloroform  at  180°  into  ammonic  chloride  and 
cyanide : 

HCC13  +  5NH3  =  3NH4C1  +  (NH4)CN  ; 

by  addition  of  potassic  hydrate  ammonic  cyanide  is  obtained  at  con- 
siderably lower  temperatures  : 

HCCI3  +  2NH3  +  3KOH  =  3KC1  +  (NH4)CN  +  3H20. 

Alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  converts  it  into  potassic  chloride  and 
formate : 

HCC13  +  4HOK  =  3KC1  +  HCO.OK  +  2H20, 

or  in  presence  of  alkylamines  give^  the  alkyl  isocyanates  (§  278). 

The  chloroform  of  commerce,  especially  when  prepared  from 
alcohol,  is  frequently  contaminated  with  other  bodies,  such  as  alcohol, 
aldehyde,  ethylidene  dichloride,  &c,  and  then  readily  becomes  useless 
on  keeping.  Pure  chloroform  must  be  without  action  on  vegetable 
colours,  must  not  colour  a  mixture  of  sulphuric  and  chromic  acids 


IODOFORM.  NITROFORM.  331 

green,  must  not  turn  brown  with  sulphuric  acid  or  potassic  hydrate, 
and  must  not  suddenly  evolve  inflammable  gases  (monochlor  ethylene) 
when  heated  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate. 

By  the  action  of  chlorine  on  boiling  chloroform  in  sunlight 
Carbonic  tetrachloride,  or  tetrachlor  methane,  CC14,  is  obtained  as  a 
colourless  oil  of  ethereal  odour,  of  sp.gr.  T56  and  of  boiling  point  78°. 
The   same   compound   is   formed   by  passing  chlorine  into  a  heated 
mixture  of  carbonic  disulphide  and  antimonic  chloride  : 

CS2  +  6C1  =  S2C12  +  CC14. 

The  product  is  distilled,  and  that  portion  passing  over  below  100° 
treated  with  solution  of  potassic  hydrate  in  order  to  decompose  the 
sulphur  chloride. 

Potassic  hydrate  decomposes  an  alcoholic  solution  of  carbonic 
tetrachloride  into  potassic  chloride  and  carbonate  : 

CC14  +  6KOH  =  4KC1  +  K2C03  +  3H20; 

and  nascent  hydrogen  converts  it  into  chloroform,  methene  dichloride, 
methylic  chloride,  and  even  methane  : 

CC14  +  2H  =  CHC13  +  HC1,  <fec. 

Methane  is  also  obtained  when  the  vapour  of  tetrachlor  methane  mixed 
with  hydrogen  is  passed  through  red-hot  tubes  : 

CC14  +  4H2  =  CH4  +  4HC1. 

539.  Formyl  tribromide,  bromoform,  CH Br 3,  is  obtained,  similarly 
to  chloroform,  by  the  action  of  bromine  and  potassic  hydrate  upon 
methylic  and  ethylic  alcohols,  acetone,  ttc.  It  closely  resembles  chloro- 
form, but  has  a  higher  sp.  gr.  (2*9),  boils  between  150°  and  152°,  and 
solidifies  at  —  9°  to  a  colourless  crystalline  mass. 

On  heating  bromoform  or  carbonic  disulphide  with  bromine,  car- 
bonic tetrabromide,  CBr4,  is  obtained;  it  melts  at  92"5°,  is  insoluble 
in  water,  and  forms  tabular  crystals. 

540.  Formyl  triiodide,  or  iodoform,  CH3I,  is  obtained  by  heating 
methylic  and  ethylic  alcohols,  ether,  acetone,  sugar,  dextrine,  albumin- 
oids, <fec.,  with  potassic  hydrate  and  iodine.  It  separates  thereby  in 
yellow  leafy  crystals,  which  on  recrystallisation  from  ether  form  large, 
citron-yellow,  brilliant,  hexagonal  tables.  It  is  insoluble  in  water, 
but  readily  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether.  At  ordinary  temperatures 
it  evaporates  slowly  and  smells  like  saffron.  It  evaporates  readily 
and  unchanged  with  aqueous  vapour  and  melts  at  119°.  Its  reactions 
resemble  those  of  chloroform.  Its  convertibility  into  methene  com- 
pounds has  been  already  mentioned  (§  380). 

If  iodoform  be  distilled  with  plumbic,  mercuric,  or  zinic  chlorides, 
formyl  dichloroiodide,  or  dichloriodoform,  CHC12I,  passes  over  as  a 
yellow-coloured  oil,  boiling  at  131°.  Bromine  converts  iodoform  into 
formyl  dibromiodide,  or  dibromiodoform,  CHBr2I. 

541.  Nitroform,  or  trinitro-methane,  CH(N02)3,  is  formed  by 
the  action  of  the  most  concentrated  nitric  acid  upon  the  bile  acids, 
upon  cenanthol,  and  some  organic  bodies.  It  is  usually  prepared  from 
triaceto-nitrile  (see  later).  On  boiling  this  with  water  or  alcohol, 
carbonic  anhydride  is  evolved,  and  the  solution  evaporated  on  com- 


332  DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  ACID  RADICALS,   CnH2n_1. 

pletion  of  the  reaction  yields  yellow  crystals  of  a  saline  ammonium 
derivative  of  nitroform  : 

C(lSr02)3.CN  +  2H20  =  C(N02)3.NH4  +  C02. 

On  heating  this  latter  with  concentrated  sulphuric  acid,  nitroform 
separates  as  a  colourless  oil,  which  crystallises  on  cooling  : 

C(NH4)(N02)3  +  H2S04  =  (NH4)HS04  +  CH(N02)3. 

Trinitro-methane  crystallises  in  colourless  cubes,  which  melt  at  15°  to 
a  liquid  of  powerful  odour.  It  decomposes  slowly  at  100°,  on  quicker 
heating,  with  violent  explosion. 

Nitroform  has  the  properties  of  a  powerful  acid,  combines  with 
ammonia,  forming  C(NH4)(N02)3,  and  yields  yellow  crystallisable 
salts  with  the  alkalies  : 

CH(N02)3  +  KOH  =  CK(N02)3  +  H20. 

A  mixture  of  concentrated  nitric  and  sulphuric  acids  converts  it  into 
Tetranitro-methane : 

CH(N02)3  +  HO.N02  +  H2S04  =  H4S05  +  C(N02)4, 

a  colourless  uninflammable  oil,  boiling  at  126°,  which  solidifies  in  the 
cold  to  colourless  crystals,  melting  at  about  13°. 

542.  Nitro-chloroform,  or  chloro-picrin,  CC13(N02),  is  formed  by 
the  distillation  of  methylic  or  ethylic  alcohol  with  sodic  chloride, 
nitric  acid,  and  sulphuric  acid.  It  is  formed  from  many  chlorinated 
organic  bodies  by  heating  with  concentrated  nitric  acid  : 

CCl3.CHO  +  HO.N02  =  CC13(N02)  +  H20  +  C02. 

Chloral. 

By  heating  chloroform  with  concentrated  nitric  and  sulphuric  acids, 
but  little  chloro-picrin  is  formed  together  with  many  gaseous  pro- 
ducts : 

CHC13  +  HON02  +  H2S04  =  H4S05  +  C(N02)C13. 

It  is  most  readily  prepared  by  mixing  one  part  of  a  solution  of  trinitro- 
phenol  (picric  acid),  saturated  at  30°,  with  ten  parts  of  bleaching 
powder  rubbed  up  with  water  to  a  thick  paste,  when,  without  appli- 
cation of  heat,  chloro-picrin  distils  as  a  colourless,  uninflammable  oil, 
of  sp.  gr.  1*66,  boiling  at  112°-113°.  The  vapour  attacks  the  mucous 
membrane  violently.  Treated  with  iron  filings  and  acetic  acid,  it 
yields  methylamine  : 

2CC13(N02)  +  12Fe  +  18HO.C2H30  =  2CH3.NH2  +  4H20 
+  3FeCl2  +  9Fe(O.C2H30)2. 

With  sodic  ethylate  it  gives  ethylic  ortho-carbonate  (§  227),  and  by 
heating  with  alcoholic  ammonia,  guanidine  (§  127): 

C(N02)C13  +  7NH3  =  C(NH)(NH2)2  +  3NH4C1  +  2H20  +  N2. 

Dinitrodichloro-methane,  C(N02)2C12,  is  formed  by  distilling 
naphthaline  chloride  with  nitric  acid,  as  a  colourless  oil,  distillable

Nitro-bromoform,  CBr3(N02),  is  obtained,  like  chloro-picrin,  by 
heating  picric  acid  with  lime  paste  and  bromine.     It  is  an  oil,  crystal-

chloro-picrin.  It  cannot  be  distilled  under  ordinary  pressure  without 
decomposition,  but  distils  unchanged  in  vacuo. 

Acetylic  Trichloride. 

543.  Acetylic  trichloride,  or  trichlor  ethane,  CH3.CC13,  is  formed, 
together  with  ethylidene  dichloride  and  higher  substitution  products, 
when  ethylic  chloride  vapour  is  mixed  with  chlorine  in  sunlight.  The 
reaction  is  generally  conducted  in  a  balloon,  as  in  the  preparation  of 
ethylidene  dichloride  (fig.  21,  §  473).  Another  still  better  method 
consists  in  passing  chlorine  on  to  the  surface  of  ethylidene  dichloride 
contained  in  a  glass  balloon  exposed  to  sunshine.  The  balloon  is  at 
starting  heated  on  a  water  bath  until  the  ethylidene  dichloride  begins 
to  boil.     If  the  chlorine  be  added  quickly,  and  the  process  : 

CH3.CHC12  +  Cl2  =  HC1  +  CH3.CCI3, 

is  lively,  the  liquid  continues  to  boil  of  itself.  The  action  is  interrupted 
as  soon  as  the  temperature  of  the  boiling  liquid  reaches  70°.  But 
small  quantities  of  chlorine-richer  products  are  then  formed  ;  there  is, 
however,  still  some  unaltered  ethylidene  dichloride.  Acetylic  trichloride 
is  obtained  pure  by  fractional  distillation. 

It  is  a  colourless  liquid,  of  chloroform-like  odour,  not  miscible 
with  water,  boils  at  73°-75°,  and  is  converted  into  potassic  acetate  by 
heating  with  aqueous  or  aqueo-alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  : 

CH3.CCI3  +  4HOK  =  3KC1  +  CH3.CO.OK  +  2H20. 

Ethereal    Derivatives    of   Acidyls, 
Cn.H2n.+1.C;  (O.CnH2n  +  i)3- 

544.  One  molecule  of  an  acidyl  trihaloid  so  reacts  with  three  mole- 
cules of  a  sodic  alkylate  that  in  great  part  the  three  halogen  atoms 
are  replaced  by  oxyalkyl  groups,  and  the  ethereal  derivatives  of  the 
acidyl  radicals  obtained.  Boiling  solutions  of  alkaline  hydrates  con- 
vert these  compounds  into  alcohols  and  salts  of  the  monobasic  organic 
acids  : 

Cn'Han,+  1.C;  (O.CnH2n  +  1)3  +  HOK  +  H20  =  Cn.H2n.+  1.CO.OK 
+  3CnH2n+1.OH. 

So  far  only  the  following  compounds  have  been  obtained  : — 

Formylrtriethyl  ether,  or  ethylic  orthoformate,  H.C  •  (O.C2II5)3,  is 
obtained  by  heating  chloroform  with  an  alcoholic  solution  of  sodic 
ethylate  : 

H.CCI3  +  3NaO.C2Hft  =  3NaCl  +  H.C(O.C2H5)3, 

as  a  liquid  boiling  at  146°  and  insoluble  in  water.  It  yields  potassic 
formate  when  heated  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate. 

Ac.tyl-triethyl  ether,  or  ethylic  ortho-acetate,  CH3.C  ■  (OC2H5)3,  is 
formed  by  heating  acetylic  trichloride  with  sodic  ethylate  free  from 
alcohol  in  presence  of  ethylic  ether  at  100°-120°  : 

CH3.CC13  +  3NaO.C2H5  =  3NaCl  +  CH3.C(O.C2H5)3. 


334  DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  ACID  RADICALS,   C^n^. 

At  the  same  time  a  peculiar  compound  is  formed  according  to  the 
equation  : 

CH3.CCI3  +  2£TaO.C2H5  =  2NaCl  +  HO.C2H5  +  CH2  :CC1(0.C2H5). 

This  boils  at  122°,  and  cannot  be  completely  separated  from  the  acetyl- 
triethyl  ether  by  fractional  distillation.  The  latter  boils  at  about  142°, 
and  on  heating  to  120°  with  water  decomposes  into  acetic  acid  and 
alcohol  : 

CH3.C(O.C2H5)3  +  2H20  =  CH3.CO.OH  +  3HO.C2H5. 

Acido-nitriles,  or  Alkyl  Cyanides,  Cn,H2n,+  1.C  .:N. 

545.  The  three  bonds  of  the  acid  radical  can  be  united  to  a  single 
nitrogen  atom.  There  thereby  result  compounds  of  the  true  cyanogen 
group,  — CEEN,  with  the  alcohol  radical  of  next  lowest  carbon  con- 
tents, the  true  alkyl  cyanides,  acidyl  nitriles,  or  acido-nitriles,  which 
are  isomeric  with  the  alkyl  isocyanides  or  alkyl  carb-ammonium  com- 
pounds (§§  278  and  279). 

As  alkyl  cyanides  these  compounds  are  obtained  with  carbon- 
nucleus  synthesis  when  alcoholic  solutions  of  the  alkyl  haloids,  best 
the  iodides,  are  heated  with  potassic  cyanide  or  potassic  mercuric 
cyanide  :

or  when  an  intimate  mixture  of  a  potassic  alkyl  sulphate  and  potassic 
cyanide  is  submitted  to  dry  distillation : 

(CnH2n+1)KS04  +  KCN  =  K2S04  +  CnH2n  +  1.CN. 

In  the  latter  method  some  isocyanide,  (CnH2n+1).N  ■  C,  also  distils 
over.  In  order  to  destroy  this  the  distillate  is  shaken  with  water 
containing  hydrochloric  acid  until  the  unpleasant  odour  of  the  iso- 
cyanide has  disappeared ;  the  excess  of  acid  is  neutralised  by  addition 
of  dried  soda,  and  the  cyanide  obtained  pure  on  distillation. 

These  compounds  are  also  formed  by  the  action  of  cyanogen 
chloride  on  the  zinc  dialkyls  : 

2NCC1  +  Zn(CnHan+1)2  =  ZnCl2  +  2N:C.CnH2n  +  1. 

As  acido-nitriles  these  compounds  are  obtained  by  distillation  of 
the  acid  amides  with  phosphoric  anhydride  :

546.  As  triad  nitrogen  compounds  the  nitriles  (like  prussic  acid) 
unite  directly  with  a  molecule  of  a  halogen  hydro-acid.  The  com- 
pounds so  formed  decompose  with  water  into  an  ammonic  salt  and 
free  organic  acid  : 

Cn-H2n,+  ,.0  i  :NT<c!  +  2H20  =  NH4C1  +  Cn,H2n,+  j.CO.OH. 


NITRILES.  335 

The  cyanides  undergo  the  same  change  when  boiled  with  a  strong 
mineral  acid.  Alkalies  act  on  them  in  a  similar  way,  giving  free 
ammonia  and  the  potassic  salt  of  a  monobasic  acid  of  like  carbon 
contents  : 

Cn,H2n,+  1.CN  +  HOK  +  H20  =  Cn,H2n,+  1.CO.OK  +  NH3. 

Nascent  hydrogen  converts  them  into  the  alkylamines  (§  266). 

547.  Formo-nitrile,  HCN,  has  already  been  described  as  hydro- 
cyanic acids  amongst  the  cyanogen  compounds  (§  74). 

Aceto-nitrile,  or  methylic  cyanide,  CH3.CN",  is  obtained  either  from 
methylic  iodide  and  potassic  cyanide,  or  best  from  acetamide  by  dis- 
tillation with  phosphoric  anhydride.  It  is  a  colourless,  agreeable- 
smelling  liquid,  which  boils  at  82°,  mixes  with  water  in  every  pro- 
portion, and  burns  with  a  violet-mantled  flame. 

It  combines  with  a  molecule  of  bromine,  on  heating  to  100°,  to  a 
body,  CH3.CNBr2,  crystallising  in  rhombic  prisms,  melting  and 
subliming  at  65°,  and  probably  of  the  constitution  CH2Br.CNHBr. 

The  bodies  CH3.CN.HBr  and  CH3.CNHI,  obtained  directly 
with  considerable  evolution  of  heat,  are  solid  crystalline  masses. 

Aceto-nitrile  also  unites  with  phosphorous  chloride,  CH3.CN.PC13, 
and  with  many  metallic  haloids  forming  crystalline  compounds,  such 
as  CH3.CN,SbCl5,  (CH3.CN)2SnCl4,  &c.  These  volatilise  on  heating 
and  condense  unchanged,  but  are  decomposed  by  water. 

548.  Propio-nitrile,  or  ethylic  cyanide,  C2H5.CN,  is  prepared  from 
ethylic  iodide,  or  ethylic  potassic  sulphate  and  potassic  cyanide,  also 
from  propionamide  and  phosphoric  anhydride.  It  is  a  colourless 
liquid  of  agreeable  odour,  not  miscible  with  water  in  every  propor- 
tion, which  boils  at  98°  and  has  sp.  gr.  '787.  It  yields  similar  com- 
pounds to  aceto-nitrile  with  bromine,  hydro-acids,  and  metallic 
chlorides. 

If  propio-nitrile  be  allowed  to  drop  on  metallic  potassium,  a  violent 
reaction  occurs,  in  which  potassic  cyanide  and  butane  are  formed : 

2C2H5.CN  +  K2  =  2KCN  +  C4H10, 

but  at  the  same  time  a  part  polymerises  to 

Cyanethine,  C9H15N3.  This  latter  is  a  white,  odourless  body, 
crystallising  in  leafy  crystals,  which  melt  at  190°  and  boil  at  290° 
with  partial  decomposition.  It  is  little  soluble  in  cold  water,  is  a 
strong  base,  and  yields  crystalline  salts  with  one  equivalent  of  acid, 
e.g.  C9H15N3,HN03.  Its  constitution  is  not  yet  certain,  but  from 
its  formation  it  would  appear  to  be  triethylic  tricyanide  (§  72) :

It  is  an  oil  of  peculiar  aromatic  odour,  boiling  at  107°-108°. 

550.  Valero-nitriles,  or  butylic  cyanides,  C4H9.CN.  Four  of  these

1.  Normal  valero-nitrile,  or  butylic  cyanide  : 

CH3.CH2.CH2.CH2.CN, 

is  prepared  from  normal  butylic  haloids  and  potassic  cyanide.  It 
boils  at  140-5°  and  has  at  0°  sp.  gr.  -8164. 

2.  Isovalero-nitrile,  or  isobutylic  cyanide,  is  prepared  from  iso- 
butylic  iodide  and  potassic  cyanide,  or  by  heating  isovaleric  acid  with 
potassic  sulpho-cyanate,  as  a  colourless  oil  of  bitter  almond  odour,  of 
sp.  gr.  -8227  at  0°,  and  boiling  at  126°-128°. 

3.  Trimethyl  aceto-nitrile,  or  trimethyl  carbin-cyanide  : 

CH3Nv

is  obtained  readily  by  the  action  of  pure  trimethyl  carbin-iodide  on 
potassic  mercuric  cyanide.  Some  isocyanide,  (CH3)3C.N=EC,  is 
always  formed  at  the  same  time,  but  is  readily  decomposed  by  hydro- 
chloric acid.  Trimethyl  aceto-nitrile  is  a  colourless  oil,  boiling  at  105°- 
106° ;  on  cooling  it  solidifies  to  a  crystalline  mass,  melting  at  16°.

has  sp.  gr.  -8187  at  14°. 

Cetylic  cyanide,  or  margaro-nitrile,  C16H31.CN,  is  prepared  by  the

On  distillation  the  salt  remains  in  white  needles,  which  can  be  re-

By  action  of  various  chemical  bodies  on  the  acids  the  acidoxyls 
behave  in  many  ways  like  the  alcohol  radicals.  The  hydroxyl  group 
is  replaced  by  halogen  when  they  are  treated  with  phosphoric  haloids,

and  the  diacidoxyl  sulphides  or  sulph-anhydrides  : 

Cn'H2n'+  1.CO.S.CO.Cn"H2n"+  \, 

are  obtained. 

The  aldehydes  (§  383),  CnH2n+ ^CO.H,  may  be  considered  as  the 
hydrides  of  the  acidoxyls,  standing  to  the  acids  in  the  same  relations 
as  those  of  the  paraffins  to  the  alcohols  of  the  series  CnH2n+1.OH. 
The  ketones  may  be  looked  on — in  agreement  with  several  of  their 
methods  of  formation  (§  436) — as  compounds  of  the  acidoxyls  with 
alcohol  radicals  : 

CH3.CO.CH3,  acetone  =  acetyl-methyl. 

As  the  acids  occur  frequently  in  nature  in  the  free  state  or  in 
form  of  their  metallic  or  ethereal  salts — in  the  latter  case  mostly  as 
salts  of  the  trihydric  alcohol  glycerine,  forming  the  chief  constituents 
of  animal  and  vegetable  fats — it  is  advisable  to  consider  them  before 
all  other  acidoxyl  compounds,  which  are  generally  prepared  from 
them. 

The  Monobasic  Fatty  Acids,  CnH2n02. 
Acidoxyl  Hydrates,  CnH^^O.OH  or  Cn-H2n,+  1. CO.OH. 

556.  The  homologous  series  of  fatty  acids  contains  members  with 
from  one  to  thirty  carbon  atoms. 

In  the  case  of  the  three  first  members,  as  in  that  of  the  primary 
alcohols  of  like  carbon  contents,  no  isomers  exist,  but  the  formula 
C4H7O.OH  corresponds  to  two  isomeric  acids,  which  are  obtained  by 
oxidation  of  the  two  primary  butylic  alcohols  (§  169).  With  increase 
in  the  carbon  contents  the  number  of  possible  isomers  increases  in 
rapid  progression. 

In  general  the  number  of  possible  acids  of  any  given  carbon  con- 
tents is  the  same  as  that  of  the  primary  alcohols,  with  like  number  of 
carbon  atoms,  as  only  primary  alcohols  can  be  converted  into  acids 
by  oxidation  without  alteration  of  the  carbon  nucleus  :

I  +  20  =  H20  +      I 

CH2.OH  CO.OH 

Further,  as  the  number  of  primary  alcohols  of  equal  number  of 
carbon  atoms,  n,  is  as  great  as  that  of  all — primary,  secondary,  and 
tertiary — alcohols  of  the  next  lowest  number  of  carbon  atoms,  n  —  1, 
the  number  of  possible  isomeric  acids  with  n  carbon  atoms  must  also 
be  the  same,  as  every  fatty  acid  is  the  compound  of  the  next  lowest 
alkyl,  Cn_1H2(n_1)  +  1  or  Cn.H2n>+ ,,  if  n_i=n>,  with  the  carboxyl 
hydrate  group,  CO.OH. 

Above  C18  many  members  entirely  lack  representatives;  the 
number  of  known  members  of  the  series  is,  however,  larger  than  in

With  increasing  carbon  contents  the  solubility  of  the  fatty  acids 
rapidly  diminishes,  and  the  melting  and  boiling  points  rise,  with  the 
modifications  already  mentioned  (§§  54-57).  Acids  containing  more 
than  ten  carbon  atoms  in  the  nucleus  can  no  longer  be  volatilised

volatilisation  is  higher,  and,  though  not  yet  determined,  certainly 
above  a  nucleus  of  eighteen  carbon  atoms  (comp.  §  594).

Preparation  of  Fatty  Acids. 

558.  The  fatty  acids  can  be  obtained  without  essential  alteration 
of  the  carbon  nucleus  of  the  bodies  they  are  prepared  from,  and 
especially  without  alteration  of  the  number  of  carbon  atoms — 

1.  From  the  primary  alcohols,  CnH2n  +  1.OH,  their  ethers,  and 
other  oxy  compounds  of  the  alkyls,  by  oxidation  with  ozone  or  oxidis- 
ing agents  or  by  fused  potassic  hydrate  (§§  160,  1,  and  556). 

2.  From  the  aldehydes,  CnH2nO,  which  are  themselves  obtained 
from  the  primary  alcohols  by  less  active  oxidation  :

PKKPARATION   OF   THE  FATTY   ACIDS.  341 

The  oxidising  agent  employed  for  the  alcohols  is  a  mixture  of 
potassic  bichromate  ami  sulphuric  acid,  the  reaction  generally  starting 
without  external  application  of  heat  : 

3Cn,H2n,+  pCHj-OH  +  2K2Cr207  +  8H2S04  =  2K2Cr2(S04)4 
+  11H20  +  3Cn,H2n,+4.CO.OH 

3.  The  acido-nitriles  (§  546)  are  converted  into  the  free  fatty  acids 
by  heating  with  aqueous  hydrochloric  or  sulphuric  acids  : 

C„JI2n,+  1.CN  +  HC1  +  2HOH  =  NH4C1  +  CnH2n,+  1.CO.OH; 

and  on  boiling  with  solution  of  potassic  hydrate  they  yield  ammonia 
and  the  potassic  salt  of  the  fatty  acid  : 

(VH2n,+  1.CN  +  H20  +  HOK  =  M3  +  CnH2n  +  1.CO.OK. 

559.  The  fatty  acids  can  be  obtained,  with  increase  of  the  carbon 
nucleus,  by  several  methods  from  the  alcohols  of  next  lower  number 
of  carbon  atoms.     Of  these  methods  there  may  be  mentioned — 

1.  From  the  alcohols,  by  means  of  their  haloids  or  hydric  sul- 
phates, the  alkyl  cyanides  or  acido-nitriles  are  prepared,  and  these 
then  transformed  as  above. 

2.  Mixtures  of  sodium  alky  Is  with  zinc  dialkyls  (§  371)  absorb 
dry  carbonic  anhydride,  which  unites  with  the  sodium  compound, 
forming  a  sodium  salt  of  the  alkyl  carbonic  acid  :

3.  Alcoholic  solutions  of  potassic  alkylates  (§  197)  slowly  absorb 
dry  carbon  monoxide  gas  on  warming,  and  yield,  though  with  diffi- 
culty, the  potassic  salts  of  the  alkyl  carbonic  acids : 

CnH2n+1  ^nti2n+l 

I  +  CO  =  i 

OK  CO.OK 

A  better  result  is  obtained  by  the  use  of  dry  sodic  alkylates  and 
higher  temperatures  (190°-210°),  but  the  reaction  appears  to  be  con- 
fined to  the  lower  members  of  the  series,  taking  an  entirely  different 
course  with  sodic  isoamylate. 

4.  A  method  of  very  general  application  in  the  synthesis  of  fatty 
acids  starts  from  the  product  of  the  action  of  sodium  upon  ethylic 
acetate  (see  this).  The  ethylic  aceto-acetate,  separable  therefrom, 
dissolves  an  atom  of  sodium  with  evolution  of  hydrogen,  and  yields 
pure  ethylic  sodaceto-acetate,  CH3.CO.CHNa.CO.O.C2H5,  in  which, 
by  action  of  alkyl  haloids,  the  sodium  atom  can  be  replaced  by  an 
alkyl  group.     The  ethylic  alkyl  aceto-acetates  : 

CH3.CO  lCH.CO.O.C2H5, 

v^nxl-2n+  1  J 

so  obtained  (which,  by  boiling  with  alkalies,  yield  ketones  [§  436,  2]), 
on  heating  alone,  or  better  with  ethylic  sodaceto-acetate  or  sodic 
ethylate,    eliminate    CH2.CO     (of  which    several    groups    coalesce

to  form  complicated  molecules,  e.g.  dehydracetic  acid)  and  give  the 
ethylic  salt  of  a  fatty  acid  :

from  which  the  synthetically  formed  fatty  acid  is  obtained  on  saponi- 
fication. 

The  ethylic  alkyl  aceto-acetates  can  further  exchange  an  atom  of 
hydrogen  for  sodium.    The  ethylic  alkyl  sodaceto-acetates  : 

CH3.CO    Wa>c0.0.C2H5,

thus  formed,  yield,  on  heating  with  alkyl  iodides,  sodic  iodide  and  an

560.  Fatty  acids  are  obtained  with  splitting,  i.e.  diminution  of 
the  carbon  nucleus  by  numerous  decompositions  of  carbon-richer  com- 
pounds. As  already  mentioned,  the  secondary  alcohols  and  their 
first  oxidation  products,  the  ketones,  yield  by  the  action  of  powerful 
oxidising  agents  (chromic  and  sulphuric  acids  on  heating)  always  at 
least  two  molecules  of  acid,  the  sum  of  whose  carbon  atoms  is  the 
same  as  the  number  of  carbon  atoms  in  the  parent  body  (§  437). 
Tertiary  alcohols  on  oxidation  are  generally  decomposed  into  three  or 
more  acid  molecules. 

As  general  methods  there  may  be  mentioned  the  splitting  up  of 
the  acids  of  the  lactic  series  by  heating  with  sulphuric  acid  or  oxida- 
tion, or  that  of  the  acids  of  the  acrylic  series  by  fusion  with  potassic 
hydrate. 

561.  Very  important  methods  of  obtaining  fatty  acids  start  from 
their  naturally  occurring  alcoholic  salts,  especially  from  the  vegetable 
and  animal  fats.  These,  on  heating  with  aqueous  or  alcoholic  solutions 
of  strong  basic  hydrates,  yield  the  respective  alcohols  together  with  a 
metallic  salt  of  the  fatty  acid  :

The  alkali  salts  of  monobasic  fatty  acids  of  high  molecular  weight, 

which  dissolve  unchanged  in  alcohol  and  little  water,  but  are  partially 


PREPARATION  OF  THE  FATTY  ACIDS.  343 

decomposed  by  much  water  into  free  alkali  and  fatty  acid  (which 
latter  causes  the  liquid  to  appear  turbid,  and  to  froth  strongly  on 
shaking),  are  termed  soaps,  and  from  this  the  process  of  decomposi- 
tion of  all  alcoholic  salts  by  alkalies  has  been  termed  '  saponification! 
The /ate  are  organic  salts  of  the  trihydric  alcohol  glycerine,  and 
yield  therefore,  on  saponification,  glycerine  and  three  molecules  of  the 
alkali  salt  of  an  organic  acid  :

I  I 

CH2.O.CO.CnH2n  + ,  CH2.OH 

Fat.  Glycerine.  Soap. 

Most  of  the  natural  fats  contain  the  glycerine  salts  of  several 
fatty  acids,  most  also  of  acids  of  the  oleic  series,  CnH2n_3O.OH, 
and  therefore  yield  on  saponification  a  mixture  of  potassic  salts,  from 
which  mineral  acids  set  free  a  mixture  of  acids.  The  separation  of 
the  single  acids  is  in  such  cases  attended  with  extraordinary  difficul- 
ties, and  is  partly  impossible  even. 

If  together  with  non-volatile  acids  of  high  molecular  weight 
also  acids  of  lower  molecular  weight,  which  can  be  volatilised  un- 
changed, occur,  the  two  groups  can  be  separated  by  distillation  with 
water  vapour.  The  distillate  then  contains  the  volatile  acids,  either 
dissolved  in  the  water  or  floating  as  an  oily  layer  on  its  surface.  In 
order  to  separate  them  further,  as  a  rule  they  are  converted  into  baric 
salts  by  boiling  with  solution  of  baric  hydrate,  and  these — utilising 
the  different  solubility  of  the  respective  salts — separated  from  one 
another  by  crystallisation,  each  one  being  purified  by  repeated  re- 
cry  stallisation. 

562.  If  only  two  volatile  acids  have  to  be  separated  from  one 
another,  this  can  be  effected  either  by  fractional  distillation,  or  the 
method  of  partial  saturation  with  following  distillation  may  be  used. 
One  half  of  the  acid  mixture  is  neutralised  with  alkali,  the  other  half 
then  added,  and  the  whole  aqueous  solution  submitted  to  distillation 
as  long  as  any  liquid  of  acid  reaction  passes  over.  The  distillate  then 
contains  mainly  the  acid  of  lower  boiling  point,  with  a  small  quantity 
of  the  less  volatile  acid,  the  residue  mainly  of  a  salt  of  the  latter.  By 
renewed  partial  saturation  and  distillation,  and  if  needful  frequent 
repetition  of  the  process  on  the  distillate,  the  non- volatile  acid  is  at 
last  obtained  alone  in  aqueous  solution,  but  evidently  with  great 
loss  in  the  process.  From  the  residue  of  the  first  distillation,  con- 
taining a  little  of  the  salt  of  the  more  volatile  and  much  of  the  salt 
of  the  less  volatile  acid,  the  latter  is  obtained  pure  by  decomposing 
the  salts  with  sulphuric  acid,  distilling,  half  saturating  the  distillate, 
and  again  distilling.  The  residual  salt  is  again  subjected  to  a  similar 
process,  until  at  last  the  less  volatile  acid  salt  is  left  in  a  state  of 
purity. 

563.  From  mixtures  of  non-volatile  acids  the  admixed  members 
of  the  oleic  series  must  first  be  removed.  This  is  effected  by  pre- 
cipitating the  solution  of  the  alkali  salts  by  plumbic  acetate,  and  so 
converting  them  into  the  insoluble  lead  salts  (lead  plaster) ;  this 
latter  is  then  dried  and  extracted  with  ether  as  long  as  any  lead  salts 


344  DERIVATIVES  OF  THE   ACID   RADICALS,   CnH^. 

of  oleic  acids  are  removed.  By  evaporating  the  ether  from  this 
solution  the  lead  salts  of  the  oleic  acids  are  obtained,  from  which  the 
latter  can  be  separated. 

The  portion  insoluble  in  ether  consists  of  the  lead  salts  of  the 
acids  of  the  fatty  series  rich  in  carbon,  which  can  be  liberated  by 
decomposition  with  mineral  acids,  especially  hydrochloric  acid. 

The  preparation  of  the  pure  acids  is  attended  with  great  difficul- 
ties and  loss,  as  with  not  too  great  difference  in  composition  there  is 
but  little  difference  in  properties.  If  the  mixture  contains  but  two 
members  of  the  series  (e.g.  palmitic  and  stearic  acids),  the  partial 
separation  succeeds  only  by  the  method  of  partial  precipitation.  The 
mixture  is  dissolved  in  alcohol,  and  alcoholic  solution  of  magnesic 
acetate  added  with  constant  stirring  in  such  quantity  that  only  about 
one-seventh  of  the  fatty  acids  shall  be  precipitated  as  magnesic  salt, 
and  the  precipitate  a  then  separated  from  the  solution  b  of  the 
greatest  part  of  the  acid  mixture  by  filtration,  a  consists  mainly 
of  the  magnesic  salt  of  the  acid  richer  in  carbon  (stearic  acid),  but  is 
still  contaminated  by  the  acid  poorer  in  carbon.  It  is  therefore 
decomposed  by  hydrochloric  acid,  the  free  fatty  acid  dissolved  again 
in  alcohol,  and  one-seventh  precipitated  by  magnesic  acetate.  This 
precipitate,  which  contains  only  -^  of  the  quantity  of  the  original 
mixture  of  acids,  consists  nearly  entirely  of  the  salt  of  the  acid  richer 
in  carbon,  but  as  a  rule  requires  further  treatment  in  a  similar 
manner,  in  order  to  obtain  it  in  a  state  of  chemical  purity.  This 
point  is  settled  by  means  of  the  melting  point. 

The  filtrate  b  from  the  first  precipitation  is  now  partly  precipi- 
tated by  slow  addition  of  magnesic  acetate,  whereby  the  later  precipi- 
tates, and  still  more  the  solution,  become  richer  and  richer  in  the 
acid,  poorer  in  carbon  (palmitic  acid),  until  at  last — the  successive 
additions  of  magnesic  salt  being  always  smaller — a  solutionis  obtained 
which  contains  the  latter  acid  only. 

564.  That  the  fatty  acids  can  be  converted  into  members  of  the 
foregoing  series  has  been  already  mentioned  at  the  respective  places; 
it  will  therefore  suffice  to  merely  recapitulate. 

Conversion  of  fatty  acids  into  paraffins — 

1.  Without  increase  and  with  diminution  of  the  carbon  nucleus 

(§  1*9)- 

2.  With  formation  of  larger  carbon  nuclei  by  electrolysis  of  the 

fatty  alkaline  salts  (§  150). 

Conversion  into  aldehydes  (§  386),  and  through  these  into  the  cor- 
responding primary  alcohols  (§  388). 

Conversion  into  ketones  richer  in  carbon  by  dry  distillation  of  the 
salts  (§  435),  and  through  the  ketones  into  secondary  alcohols  (§  434). 

Conversion  into  tertiary  alcohols  by  means  of  the  acid  chlorides 

565.  By  oxidation  of  acids  richer  in  carbon,  by  distillation  with 
manganic  dioxide  and  sulphuric  acid,  there  are  formed,  together  with 
carbonic  anhydride  and  water,  salts  of  the  unchanged  acids  with 
alcohols  of  less  carbon  contents.  Butyric  acid,  for  instance,  yields 
propylic  butyrate  : 

CH3.CH2.CH2.CO.OH  +  HO.CO.CH2.CH2.CH3  +  0 
=  CH3.CH2.CH2.CO.O.CH2.CH2.CH3  +  C02  +  OH2. 


FORMIC  ACID.  345 

566.  If  pure  fatty  acids,  soluble  in  water,  be  brought  into  contact 
with  water,  there  occurs — frequently  with  considerable  evolution  of 
heat — a  diminution  of  the  total  volume,  which  appears  to  be  greatest 
when  one  molecule  of  acid  is  mixed  with  one  molecule  of  water.  The 
product  thereby  formed  is  the  acidyl  trihydrate  : 

:0  f0H 

Cn.H2n,  +  1.C  nTx  +  H20  =  Cn-H2n,+  1C<  OH 

corresponding  to  the  acidyl  ethers  (§  544).  These  compounds,  simi- 
larly to  the  dihydrates  of  the  aldehyde  radicals  (§  383),  are  but  little 
stable,  and  on  distillation  partly  decompose  into  their  components. 
If  brought  together  with  bases  they  yield  the  salts  of  the  monobasic 
fatty  acids  : 

Cn.H2n.+  1.C(OH)8  +  KOH  =  Cn.H2n.+1.CO.OK  +  2H20, 

which  generally  are  left  anhydrous  on  drying  at  100°. 

The  anhydrous  fatty  acids  are  attacked  by  chlorine  and  bromine, 
especially  on  heating  and  exposure  to  sunlight,  with  formation  of  halo- 
gen substitution  acids.  The  first  replacement  by  a  halogen  atom 
occurs  in  general  in  the  a  position,  i.e.  on  that  carbon  atom  which  is 
united  ta  carboxyl  hydrate  : 

CH3.CH2.CO.OH  +  Cl2  =  HC1  +  CH3.CHCl.CO.OH 

a-Chlor-propionic  acid. 
CH3.CH2.CH2.CO.OH  +  Br2  =  HBr  +  CH3.CH2.CHBr.CO.OH 

a-Brom-butyric  acid. 
(CH3)2.CH.CO.OH  +  Br2  =  HBr  +  (CH3)2:CBr.CO.OH 

o-Brom-isobutyric  acid. 

In  these  substitution  bodies,  by  boiling  with  alkalies,  the  halogen 
atom  can  be  replaced  by  hydroxyl,  so  yielding  the  a-oxyacids  of  the 
lactic  series. 

Formic  Acid,  CH202. 

567.  Formic  acid,  formoxyl  hydrate,  HCO.OH,  occurs  ready- 
formed  in  ants,  stinging  nettles,  pine  needles,  &c,  from  which  it  can  be 
separated  by  distillation  with  water.  Although  it  is  the  first  member 
of  the  series  of  fatty  acids,  it  differs  in  one  essential  from  all  others, 
inasmuch  as  in  it  the  carboxyl-hydrate  group  is  united  not  with  an 
alcohol  radical,  but  with  hydrogen.     As  hydro-carbonic  acid,  or  com-

it  is  the  half-aldehyde  of  carbonic  acid,  and  is  converted  into  the  latter 
by  the  action  of  oxidising  agents  : 

H.CO.OH  +  0  =  HO.CO.OH  =  H20  +  C02. 


346  DERIVATIVES   OF  THE  ACID  RADICALS,   CJ&a^. 

In  agreement  with  this  view  it  can  be  prepared  from  carbonic 
anhydride  by  the  action  of  nascent  hydrogen  in  the  presence  of  alkaline 
hydrates.  Potassium  is  placed  in  a  dry  basin  floating  on  luke-warm 
water,  covered  with  a  bell  filled  with  carbonic  anhydride,  and  left  to 
itself  for  24  hours,  when  the  metal  is  found  to  be  converted  into  a 
mixture  of  potassic  carbonate  : 

K2  +  C02  +  H20  =  K2C03  +  2H, 

and  potassic  formate  : 

K2  +  2C02  +  2H  =  2H.CO.OK. 

Some  formate  is  also  formed  in  a  similar  reaction  in  the  decomposition 
of  sodium  amalgam  by  a  concentrated  aqueous  solution  of  amnionic 
carbonate  : 

CO(ONH4)2  +  2Na  =  H.CO.ONa  +  NaOH  +  2NH3, 

and  by  boiling  a  mixture  of  powdered  zinc  and  zincic  carbonate  with 
solution  of  potassic  hydrate  : 

ZnC03  +  Zn  +  5KOH  =  2Zn(OK)2  +  HCO.OK  +  2H20. 

Carbonic  oxide  is  slowly  absorbed  at  100°  by  the  most  concentrated 
solution  of  potassic  hydrate,  with  formation  of  potassic  formate  : 

CO  +  HOK  =  HCO.OK. 

It  is  formed  from  hydrocyanic  acid,  formo-nitrile,  by  decomposition 
with  water,  usually  assisted  by  the  presence  of  mineral  acids  (§76) 
or  alkalies  (§  79),  and  from  methylic  alcohol  by  ozone  or  heated  soda 
lime  (§  165). 

The  formyl  trihaloids  (chloroform,  &c.)  and  formyl  triethylate 
yield  formate  on  heating  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  (§§  538 
and  544). 

Formic  acid  is  of  frequent  occurrence  as  an  oxidation  product  of 
other  organic  bodies  of  higher  molecular  weight,  as  ketones  containing 
methyl,  many  acids  of  the  lactic  series,  malic,  tartaric,  and  citric  acids, 
the  sugars  and  their  congeners.  Formerly  it  was  generally  prepared 
by  the  distillation  of  sugar  or  starch  with  sulphuric  acid  and  manganic 
dioxide  or  potassic  chromate. 

It  is  now  usually  prepared  from  oxalic  acid.  This  on  heating 
alone  yields  some  formic  acid  :

A  very  good  yield  is  obtained  when  crystallised  oxalic  acid  is  added  to 
glycerine,  rendered  as  free  as  possible  from  water,  and  heated  to 
l60°-110°.  Evolution  of  carbonic  anhydride  commences,  and  at  the 
same  time  very  dilute  formic  acid  distils.  The  greater  part  reacts 
with  the  glycerine,  forming  monoformin,  or  glycerine  monoformate  : 

C3H5(OH)3  +  [C202(OH)2,2H20]  =  C3H5(OH)2(O.CHO)  +  C02 

+  3H20. 

As  soon  as  the  evolution  of  carbonic  anhydride  ceases,  and  without 
alteration  of  the  temperature,  a  new  quantity  of  oxalic  acid  is  added, 


FORMIC  ACID.  347 

whose  water  of  crystallisation  is  partly  evolved  and  partly  resolves 
the  nionoformin  into  glycerine  and  formic  acid  : 

C3F5(OH)2(O.CHO)  +  H20  =  C8H5(OH)3  +  HO.CHO. 

The  dried  oxalic  acid  converts  anew  unaltered  glycerine  into  the  mono- 
formate  until  the  liquid  becomes  rich  in  this  latter;  the  formation 
exceeds  the  decomposition,  but  the  amount  of  the  latter  continually 
increases,  so  that  formic  acid  of  increasing  concentration  distils  over. 
At  last,  with  continued  addition  of  crystallised  oxalic  acid,  the  forma- 
tion and  decomposition  of  the  monoformin  reach  an  equal  amount, 
and  a  distillate  passes  over  containing  56  %  of  formic  acid  and  44  % 
of  water. 

By  careful  heating  of  glycerine  with  anhydrous  oxalic  acid,  a 
solution  of  formic  acid  of  70  %  may  be  obtained  (formyl  trihydrate). 

All  the  methods  described,  as  also  distillation  of  formates  with 
dilute  sulphuric  acid,  yield  aqueous  formic  acid.  In  order  to  obtain  it 
anhydrous,  the  dry  lead  salt  is  decomposed  by  dry  sulphuretted  hy- 
drogen at  a  temperature  not  exceeding  100°,  when  anhydrous  formic 
acid  distils : 

Pb(O.CHO),  +  H2S  =  PbS  +  2HO.CHO, 
which  is  freed  from  any  absorbed  sulphuretted  hydrogen  by  repeated 
rectification  over  plumbic  formate.  A  70  %  formic  acid  solution  can 
also  be  deprived  of  its  water  by  addition  of  dried  oxalic  acid,  with 
gentle  heating.  On  cooling,  crystallised  oxalic  acid  separates,  and  the 
decanted  liquid  yields  anhydrous  formic  acid  on  distillation. 

568.  Pure  formic  acid  is  a  colourless,  mobile  liquid,  which  solidi- 
fies to  a  crystalline  mass  below  0°,  melts  at  8*5°,  and  boils  at  99°.  Its 
sp.  gr.  is  1*233.  It  has  a  penetrating  acid  odour,  and  raises  blisters  on 
the  skin.  It  unites  with  a  molecule  of  water  (719  pts.  CH2.02  and 
28' 1  H20)  to  form  formyl  trihydrate  : 

HCO.OH  +  H20  =  HC(OH)3, 

a  liquid  which  does  not  solidify  at  —15°  and  which  boils  at  106°. 

Concentrated  sulphuric  acid  decomposes  formic  acid,  with  brisk 
evolution  of  carbonic  oxide  : 

H.CO.OH  +  H2S04  =  CO  +  H4S05. 

Chlorine  and  oxidising  agents  decompose  it  with  formation  of  car- 
bonic anhydride  : 

H.CO.OH  +  Cl2  =  C02  +  2HC1 
H.CO.OH  +  0    =  C02  +  H20. 
The  oxides  of  the  noble  metals  are  thereby  reduced  to  metal : 
CH202  +  HgO   =  C02  +  H20  +  Hg 
CH202  +  Ag20  =  C02  +  H20  +  Ag2. 

569.  Formates  are  all  soluble  in  water,  and  generally  crystallise 
well.  They  are  obtained  by  the  solution  of  metallic  oxides,  hydrates, 
or  carbonates  in  aqueous  formic  acid. 

Amnionic  formate,  (NH4)O.CHO,  crystallises  in  very  readily 
soluble  rectangular  prisms.  On  heating  to  180°  it  decomposes  into 
water  and  hydrocyanic  acid  (comp.  §  76)  : 

H.CO.O.NH4  =  2H20  +  HCN. 


<S48  DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  ACID  RADICALS,   0^..^ 

Plumbic  formate,  Pb(O.CHO)2,  forms  characteristic  long,  brilliant 
needles,'  rather  difficultly  soluble. 

Cupric  formate,  Cu(O.CHO)2,4H20,  forms  large  blue,  trans- 
parent crystals. 

On  shaking  aqueous  formic  acid  with  mercuric  oxide,  the  latter 
dissolves  in  large  quantity  to  mercuric  formate.  The  clear  solution 
now  begins  to  cloud,  more  quickly  on  warming,  evolves  carbonic 
anhydride,  and  deposits  difficultly  soluble,  silky  crystals  of  the  mer- 
curous  salt :

which  soon  further  decompose  into  formic  acid,  carbonic  anhydride, 
and  mercury :

If  argentic  nitrate  be  mixed  with  a  not  too  dilute  solution  of  an 
alkaline  formate,  white  crystals  of  argentic  formate  precipitate,  which 
very  soon  blacken  and  decompose  : 

2AgO.CHO  =  Ag2  +  HO.CHO  +  C02. 

Acetic  Acid,  C2H402. 

570.  Acetic  acid,  acetyl  hydrate,  HO.C2H30,  or  methyl-carbonic 
acid,  CH3.CO.OH,  is  the  oldest  known  acid.  It  occurs  frequently  in 
small  quantities,  in  form  of  salts,  in  vegetable  and  animal  fluids,  and 
is  obtained  in  the  decay  of  many  organic  bodies.  It  occurs  largely  as 
an  oxidation  product  of  organic  bodies,  whether  the  oxidation  be 
effected  in  the  wet  way  (e.g.  from  lactic  acid)  or  by  fusion  with  alka- 
line hydrates  (e.g.  malic  acid).  It  is  also  formed  by  the  dry  distillation 
of  complicated  compounds,  such  as  wood,  starch,  &c. 

Sodium  methyl  is  converted  by  absorption  of  carbonic  anhydride 
into  sodic  acetate : 

CH3.Na  +  C02  =  CH3.CO.ONa. 

Aceto-nitrile,  or  methylic  cyanide,  yields  the  same  salt  on  boiling 
with  sodic  hydrate  solution  : 

CH3.CN  +  H20  +  HONa  =  CH3.CO.ONa  +  2STH3, 

or  free  acetic  acid  when  heated  with  hydrochloric  acid  : 

CH3.CN  +  2H20  -f  HC1  =  NH4C1  +  CH3.CO.OH. 

Technically,  acetic  acid  is  prepared  from  ethylic  alcohol,  or  from 
the  products  of  the  dry  distillation  of  wood. 

Dilute  alcoholic  liquids,  especially  such  as  contain  other  animal  or 
vegetable  bodies  capable  of  decomposition,  and  mineral  salts  (beer, 
light  wines),  as  also  impure  sugar  solutions  (juice  of  fruits,  wort, 
honey-water),  become  acid  on  standing  in  the  air,  especially  at  tem- 
peratures between  20°  and  40°,  acetic  acid  being  formed  (vinegar). 


ACETIC   ACID. 


349 


The  cause  of  this  change  is  always  an  organised  ferment,  which 
has  the  power  of  absorbing  the  atmospheric  oxygen  and  carrying  it  to 
oxidised  bodies.  As  this  ferment  is  contained  in  large  quantity  in 
crude  vinegar,  some  of  this  is  always  added  to  the  alcoholic  or  sachar- 
rine  liquid,  in  order  to  start  the  fermentation  more  quickly. 

Platinum  black  acts  similarly  to  this  organised  ferment,  and  in 
presence  of  air  converts  concentrated  alcohol  into  pretty  concentrated 
acetic  acid,  heat  being  evolved. 

571.  Aqueous  acetic  acid  is  generally  prepared  on  the  large  scale 
by  the  process  known  as  '  quick  vinegar  process.' 


Fig.  2: 


The  vessels'  employed,  termed  '  graduators  '  (fig.  23),  are  made  of 
oak,  and  are  provided  with  false  perforated  discs,  one  near  the  bottom 
of  the  vessel  and  again  near  the  top.  The  space  between  these  is 
filled  with  shavings,  whilst  the  perforations  in  the  upper  disc  are  loosely 
filled  with  pieces  of  string.  The  shavings  are  first  moistened  with 
vinegar,  in  order  to  sow  the  ferment ;  there  is  then  poured  on  the 
upper  disc  a  dilute  brandy  (of  10-12  %  alcohol),  which  slowly  passes 
through  the  capillaries  of  the  strings  on  to  the  shavings,  and  flowing 
over  these  exposes  a  very  considerable  surface  to  the  air.  Care  must 
then  be  taken  that  a  stream  of  air  sufficient  for  the  oxidation  of  the 
alcohol  shall  pass  through  the  interior  of  the  vessel.  This  is  effected 
by  holes  a  in  the  sides  of  the  vessel,  whilst  the  warm  residual  air 


350  DERIVATIVES   OF  THE  ACID  RADICALS,   dH^. 

(nitrogen)  escapes  through  the  upper  openings  d  and  e.  Dilute 
vinegar  collects  at  the  bottom  of  the  flask,  and  is  drawn  off  by  a  tap. 
The  product  contains,  as  a  rule,  unaltered  alcohol,  for  whose  complete 
conversion  the  liquid  is  passed  once  or  twice  more  through  the  ap- 
paratus. 

The  regulation  of  the  amount  of  air  is  of  great  importance.  If 
there  be  not  enough,  much  aldehyde  volatilises,  whilst,  if  the  air 
stream  be  too  quick,  the  temperature  in  the  interior  of  the  apparatus 
never  reaches  the  necessary  height. 

A  large  portion  of  the  acetic  acid  employed  for  industrial  purposes 
is  obtained  from  the  aqueous  products  of  the  distillation  of  wood 
(comp.  §  165).  From  this,  by  saturation  with  lime,  calcic  acetate  is 
prepared,  which  remains  behind  in  solution  on  the  distillation  of  the 
methyl-alcohol,  acetone,  &c.  The  cleared  liquid  is  mixed  with  so 
much  solution  of  sodic  sulphate  as  is  necessary  for  the  precipitation 
of  the  calcium  as  sulphate.  The  clear  solution  of  sodic  acetate  is  then 
evaporated,  and  the  dry  salt  heated  for  a  long  time  to  250°.  Other 
products  of  dry  distillation  still  admixed  are  thus  either  volatilised  or 
carbonised.  The  salt,  after  cooling,  is  then  dissolved  in  water,  and 
the  clear  solution  distilled  with  slight  excess  of  sulphuric  acid. 

By  both  of  these  methods  aqueous  acetic  acid  is  obtained,  which 
can  only  be  concentrated  to  a  certain  degree  by  fractional  distillation. 

572.  In  order  to  prepare  acetic  acid  free  from  water,  dried  acetates 
have  to  be  employed. 

Alkaline  acetates,  freed  from  their  water  of  crystallisation  by  fusion, 
are  mixed  with  exactly  sufficient  sulphuric  acid,  or  better  with  fused 
hydric  sodic  sulphate,  and  distilled : 

2CH3.CO.ONa  +  H2S04  =  2CH3.CO.OH  +  Na2S04 
CH3.CO.ONa  +  NaHS04  =  CH3.CO.OH  +  Na2S04. 

The  anhydrous  lead  salt  also  yields  anhydrous  acetic  acid  when 
treated  by  the  last  method. 

573.  Anhydrous  acetic  acid,  glacial  acetic  acid,  is  in  the  cold  a 
white  mass  of  leafy  crystals,  which  at  +17°  melts  to  a  colourless, 
mobile  liquid,  having  a  strong  acid  smell  and  taste,  and  which  blisters 
the  skin.  Its  sp.  gr.  is  1*063  at  18°,  its  boiling  point  118°,  and  its 
vapour  density  2*09. 

On  adding  some  water  to  acetic  acid,  heat  is  evolved,  and  the 
specific  gravity  is  increased,  until  by  addition  of  one  molecule  of  H20 
it  reaches  the  maximum  1-079.  There  is  thus  formed  acetyl  trihy- 
drate : 

CH3.CO.OH  +  H20  =  CH3.C(OH)3, 

as  a  liquid  which  does  not  crystallise,  and  on  heating  to  123°  boils 
with  partial  dissociation  into  its  components.  If  this  be  diluted  with 
water  the  density  diminishes,  so  that  an  acid  which  contains  about 
50  %  H20  and  50  %  C2H302  (or  65  %  CH3.C(OH)3  and  35  %  H20) 
has  the  same  density  as  the  anhydrous  acid. 

Pure  acetic  acid,  and  also  its  aqueous  solution,  are  very  stable 
towards  oxidising  agents,  being  only  attacked  with  difficulty  by  even 
potassic  permanganate.  Its  vapour,  when  heated  in  air,  burns  with  a 
slightly  luminous  flame.    When  passed  through  red-hot  tubes,  the 


ACETATES.  351 

vapour  decomposes  into  numerous  products,  amongst  which  acetone 
and  marsh  gas  occur  largely  : 

CH3.CO.OH  =  C02  +  CH4 
2CH3.CO.OH  =  C02  +  OH2  +  CH3.CO.CH3. 

574.  Acetates. — The  neutral  metallic  salts  of  acetic  acid,  which  are 
readily  obtained  by  saturation  of  acetic  acid  with  the  basic  hydrates, 
oxides,  or  carbonates,  are  without  exception  soluble  in  water,  though 
not  very  readily  in  some  cases ;  the  alkaline  salts  are  the  most  soluble. 
These  melt  on  heating  and  decompose  at  above  300°  into  acetone  and 
an  alkaline  carbonate  : 

2CH3.CO.OK  =  CO(OK)2  +  CH3.CO.CH3. 

The  salts  of  polyvalent  heavy  metals  decompose  ac  lower  tem- 
peratures, and.  especially  if  not  quite  free  from  water  of  crystallisation, 
give  off  glacial  acetic  acid,  and  leave  a  difficultly  soluble  or  insoluble 
basic  salt,  which  decomposes  at  higher  temperatures  into  metallic 
oxide,  carbonic  anhydride,  and  acetone. 

575.  Potassic  acetate,  C2H3K02  =  CH3.CO.OK,  is  a  white  de- 
liquescent salt,  which  is  readily  soluble  in  absolute  alcohol,  and  on 
heating  fuses  to  a  thick  liquid,  which  solidifies  on  cooling  to  a  leafy 
crystalline  mass.  On  dissolving  in  concentrated  acetic  acid,  and  eva- 
porating the  excess,  there  crystallises  out  a  salt,  C2H302K,C2H402, 
in  nacreous  leaves  or  needles,  which  melt  at  148°  and  at  200°  split 
up  into  glacial  acetic  acid,  which  distils,  and  normal  potassic  acetate, 
This  potassic  diacetate  is  probably  constituted  as  in  the  following 
formula,  similarly  to  the  polymeric  aldehydes  (§  385)  : 


CH3.C=0      0=C.CH3        CH3.C<°>C.CH, 

I         +  I  =  1^     I         '

Sodic  acetate,  C2H3Na02,  crystallises  from  aqueous  solutions  in 
large  rhombic  prisms,  C2H3Na02,3H20,  which  dissolve  in  2*8  parts  of 
cold  and  more  readily  in  hot  water.  They  suffer  aqueous  fusion  at 
100°,  and  lose  their  water  of  crystallisation  at  somewhat  higher  tem- 
perature. The  dry  salt  fuses  and  behaves  quite  similarly  to  the 
potassic  salt. 

Amnionic  acetate,  C2H3(NH4)02,  is  prepared  directly  from  glacial 
acetic  acid  and  ammonia.  It  resembles  the  potassic  salt,  but  decom- 
poses on  heating  into  water  and  acetamide.  Its  solution  loses 
ammonia  on  heating  and  becomes  acid. 

The  salts  of  barium,  strontium,  calcium,  magnesium,  zinc,  &c,  are 
soluble,  and  in  part  crystallise  well. 

576.  Lead  Salts. — Normal  plumbic  acetate,  plumbic  diacetate, 
(CH3.CO.O)2Pb,3H20,  known  in  commerce  as  sugar  of  lead,  is 
obtained  by  dissolving  litharge  (PbO)  in  distilled  vinegar,  and 
crystallises  in  tetragonal  prisms  of  first  sweet,  but  later  nauseous 
metallic  taste.  It  dissolves  in  1±  part  of  water  and  eight  parts  of 
alcohol.  The  crystals  effloresce  in  dry  air.  They  fuse  in  their  water 
of  crystallisation  at  75°  and  lose  the  same  quickly  at  100°.  The  then 
solid  mass  fuses  again  at  higher  temperatures,  loses  ^  of  its  acid  in 
the  form  of  carbonic  anhydride  and  acetone,  and  solidifies  suddenly  to 


352  DERIVATIVES   OE   THE  ACID   RADICALS,   CnHan-i. 

a  greyish  white  mass  of  basic  salt,  which  decomposes  at  higher  tem- 
peratures into  plumbic  oxide,  carbonic  anhydride,  and  acetone. 

Basic  salts  are  also  prepared  by  digesting  plumbic  diacetate  with 
plumbic  oxide. 

Plumbic  monacetate  : 

2HO.Pb.O.C2H30,H20,  or  C2H3O.O.Pb.O.Pb.O.C2H30,2H20, 

is  formed  by  boiling  a  solution  of  1  part  of  sugar  of  lead  with  6  parts 
of  plumbic  oxide,  and  separates  in  crystals  on  addition  of  alcohol  to 
the  filtered  solution. 

If  a  solution  of  plumbic  diacetate  be  boiled  with  excess  of  plumbic 
oxide,  triplumbic  acetate  is  formed  : 

pb.O.C2H30      2ph0  _  pb.O.Pb.O.C2H30 
r  .O.C2H30  +  ZrbV  -  ^b.O.Pb.O.C2H30 

as  a  salt  readily  soluble  in  water,  of  strongly  alkaline  reaction,  wnich 
on  addition  of  alcohol  is  precipitated  in  fine  transparent  needles. 

Still  more  basic  salts  are  obtained  as  white  precipitates  when 
plumbic  acetate  is  decomposed  by  a  large  excess  of  ammonia,  e.g. 
hexplumbic  acetate : 

HO.Pb.O.Pb.O.Pb.O.C2H30,H20. 

All  the  basic  acetates  are  decomposed  by  carbonic  anhydride  into 
basic  carbonate  (white  lead)  and  normal  salt,  and  this  latter  also  in 
dilute  aqueous  solution  is  partly  decomposed  by  carbonic  anhydride 
into  carbonate  and  free  acetic  acid. 

577.  Copper  Salts. — In  addition  to  the  normal  salt  numerous  basic 
salts  are  known. 

Cupric  diacetate,  termed  distilled  verdigris,  obtained  by  dissolving 
cupric  oxide  in  acetic  acid,  crystallises  below  -f  8°  in  large  blue  prisms 
of  the  formula  Cu(O.CO.CH3)2,5H20,  above,  this  temperature  in  dark 
green  rhombic  prisms,  Cu(O.C2H30)2,H20.  It  is  moderately  soluble 
in  water ;  the  dilute  aqueous  solution  partly  decomposes  even  in  the 
cold,  but  more  readily  on  boiling,  into  free  acetic  acid  and  difficultly 
soluble  basic  salt.  Ordinary  verdigris  is  a  mixture  of  different  basic 
salts.  It  is  prepared  on  the  large  scale  by  exposing  plates  of  copper 
to  the  air  for  some  time  in  contact  with  acetic  acid  or  the  marc  of 
grapes. 

On  heating  a  mixture  of  equal  molecules  of  cupric  diacetate 
and  lime  with  water,  and  then  adding  acetic  acid  until  all  is  dis- 
solved, there  separates  on  evaporation  a  double  salt  of  the  formula 
Ca(O.C2H30)2,Cu(O.C2H30)2,8H20  in  deep  blue  octagonal  prisms  of 
the  quadratic  system. 

By  mixing  boiling  solutions  of  cupric  diacetate  and  arsenious  acid 
a  precipitate  is  formed  which,  after  remaining  some  time  under  the 
liquid,  changes  into  a  beautiful  green  powder  of  Schweinfurth  green. 
This  is  a  cupric  arseno-acetate  of  the  formula  Cu2(O.AsO)3(C2H30.>). 

578.  Argentic  acetate,  Ag.O.C2H30,  is  obtained  on  mixing  argentic 
nitrate  with  a  strong  solution  of  an  alkaline  acetate,  as  a  spongy  crys- 
talline precipitate,  which  dissolves  to  a  greater  extent  in  hot  water 
and  separates  again  on  cooling  in  colourless  nacreous  plates  and 
flexible  needles. 

579.  Iron  Salts. — Ferrous  diacetate,  Fe(C2H302)2,  prepared  by 


PEOPIONIC  ACID.  353 

dissolving  iron  in  acetic  acid,  crystallises  in  green  prisms,  which  dis- 
solve readily  and  are  quickly  oxidised  in  air.  Several  ferric  salts 
are  known.  By  dissolving  freshly  precipitated  ferric  hydrate  in  acetic 
acid,  a  deep  brown  red  solution  of  normal  J  err  ic  acetate  : 

Fe2(O.C2H30)6, 

is  obtained,  which — evaporated  at  a  low  temperature — yields  a  black- 
brown  syrup,  also  soluble  in  alcohol.  On  boiling  the  dilute  aqueous 
solution  all  the  iron  is  precipitated  in  the  form  of  an  amorphous  basic 
salt,  whilst  acetic  acid  is  set  free. 

580.  Aluminium  Salts. — Normal  aluminic  acetate,  Al2(O.C2H30)6, 
is  obtained  in  aqueous  solution  by  double  decomposition  of  aluminic 
sulphate  and  plumbic  acetate.  It  behaves  similarly  to  the  solution  of 
the  corresponding  ferric  salt,  e.g.  on  boiling  precipitates  all  its  alumi- 
nium as  a  strongly  basic  amorphous  salt. 

Propionic  Acid,  C3H602. 

581.  Propionyl  hydrate,  HO.C3H50,  or  ethyl  carbonic  acid, 
HO.CO.C2H5  =  HO.CO.CH2.CH3.  Propionic  acid  was  first  ob- 
tained by  oxidation  of  metacetone  with  chromic  and  sulphuric  acids, 
and  was  therefore  termed  metacetonic  acid.  It  is  formed  in  small 
quantity  in  the  dry  distillation  of  wood,  in  the  decomposition  of  sugar 
with  concentrated  potassic  hydrate,  the  action  of  carbonic  oxide 
upon  sodic  ethylate : 

CO  +  NaOC2H5  =  NaO.CO.C2H5, 

&c.  A  better  yield  is  obtained  from  carbonic  anhydride  and  sodium 
ethyl : 

C02  +  Na.C2H5  =  NaO.CO.C2K5, 

but  it  is  most  conveniently  prepared  by  decomposition  of  aceto-nitrile 
by  alkalies  or  strong  acids  in  concentrated  aqueous  solutions  : 

C2H5.C]Sr  +  H2S04  +  2H20  =  NH4.HS04  +  C2H5.CO.OH. 

It  is  further  obtained  by  reduction  of  fermentation  lactic  acid  by 
heating  with  concentrated  hydriodic  acid  :

also  from  aceto-methacetic  acid  (§  559,  4). 

Other  methods  of  formation,  as  from  /3-iodo-propionic  acid,  &c, 
will  be  mentioned  later. 

Propionic  acid  is  a  liquid  resembling  acetic  acid,  of  sp.  gr.  '991  at 
25°  and  boiling  at  140'5°.  It  mixes  in  every  proportion  with  water, 
but  is  separated  as  an  oily  layer  on  saturating  the  solution  with  calcic 
chloride. 

The  normal  propionates  are  all  soluble  in  water,  in  part  even 
more  readily  than  the  corresponding  acetates.  The  baric  salt, 
Ba(O.C3H50)2,H20,  crystallises  in  rhombic  prisms.     Normal  plum-

bic  propionate  does  not  crystallise,  or  only  with  the  greatest  difficulty ; 
the  silver  salt,  AgO.CO.C2H5,  crystallises  from  saturated  solutions  in 
tufts  of  colourless  needles,  which  require  120  times  their  weight  of 
water  at  18°  for  solution  and  blacken  at  100°.

are  known. 

1.  Normal  butyric  acid,  or  fermentation  butyric  acid: 

CH3.CH2.CH2.CO.OH, 

occurs  as  fat  (glyceric  salt)  in  butter,  as  hexylic  salt  in  the  oil  of 
Heracleum  giganteum  (§  171),  as  octylic  salt  in  the  seeds  of  Pastinaca 
sativa.  It  occurs  also  in  the  free  state  or  in  the  form  of  salts  in 
many  animal  liquids,  e.g.  in  sweat  and  muscle  juice,  and  as  a  product 
of  the  putrefaction  and  oxidation  of  many  albuminoids  and  of  gelatine. 
It  is  prepared  by  the  oxidation  of  normal  primary  butylic  alcohol,  by 
boiling  normal  propylic  cyanide  with  potassic  hydrate,  and  by  the 
decomposition  of  ethylic  aceto- ethyl  acetate. 

It  is  obtained  readily  and  in  large  quantity  by  a  peculiar  fermen- 
tation of  sugar.  A  solution,  prepared  at  the  boiling  temperature, 
and  afterwards  cooled,  of  three  kilograms  of  cane  sugar  and  fifteen 
grams  tartaric  acid  in  fifteen  kilograms  of  water  is,  after  standing  for 
several  days,  mixed  with  120  grams  of  putrefying  cheese  in  four 
kilograms  of  sour  milk ;  one  and  a  half  kilogram  of  powdered  chalk 
is  added,  and  the  mixture  then  allowed  to  stand  and  kept  at  a 
temperature  of  30°-35°.  After  about  a  week  or  a  week  and  a  half 
the  mixture  forms  a  crystalline  paste  of  calcic  lactate,  which  slowly 
becomes  again  liquid,  carbonic  anhydride  and  hydrogen  being  evolved 
and  calcic  butyrate  formed  : 

2(C3H503)2Ca  +  H20  =  (C4H702)2Ca  +  CaC03  +  3C02  +  H2. 

Calcic  lactate.  Calcic  butyrate. 

On  addition  of  sodic  carbonate  all  the  calcium  is  precipitated  as 
carbonate,  whilst  sodic  butyrate  remains  in  solution.  This  is  filtered, 
evaporated  considerably,  and  carefully  decomposed  by  a  slight  excess 
of  sulphuric  acid,  whereby  the  crude  butyric  acid  collects  as  an  oily 
layer  on  the  surface.  This  is  removed,  dried  by  means  of  calcic 
chloride,  and  purified  by  fractional  distillation.  As  in  the  fermenta- 
tion, together  with  much  acetic  acid,  some  caproic  acid  and  also  higher 
homologues  are  formed,  the  butyric  acid,  if  required  chemically  pure, 
must  be  submitted  to  further  treatment.  That  portion  of  the  crude 
acid  distilling  between  155°  and  165°  is  converted  into  the  calcic  salt 


BUTYEIC  ACIDS.  355 

by  saturation  with  thin  milk  of  lime,  and  the  filtered  solution  evapo- 
rated by  boiling.  Calcic  butyrate  then  separates  on  the  surface  as  a 
leafy  crystalline  scum;  this  is  skimmed  off,  collected  on  a  filter, 
washed  with  boiling  water,  and  then  pressed.  The  pure  calcic 
butyrate  so  obtained  is  then  converted  into  the  sodic  salt,  this  de- 
composed by  concentrated  sulphuric  acid,  and  the  oily  acid  which 
separates  rectified. 

Pure  butyric  acid  is  a  colourless  liquid  of  unpleasant,  penetrating, 
rancid  odour,  and  solidifies  in  the  cold  to  a  crystalline  mass  of 
nacreous  lustre.  It  melts  at  about  0°  and  boils  at  163° ;  its  sp.  gr.  is 
•958  at  14°.  It  mixes  in  every  proportion  with  water,  but  is  sepa- 
rated from  this  solution  by  saturation  with  readily  soluble  salts,  such 
as  calcic  chloride,  as  an  oil  containing  water,  probably  butyric  tri- 
hydrate,  C3H7.C(OH)3.  It  is  only  attacked  with  difficulty  by  oxidis- 
ing agents,  chromic  and  sulphuric  acids  first  oxidising  it  at  about 
200°  to  acetic  and  carbonic  acids  : 

CH3.CH2.CH2.CO.OH  +  2K2Cr207  +  8H2S04  =  CH3CO.OH 
+  2C02  +  10H2O  +  2K2Cr2(S04)4. 

By  more  gentle  oxidation  propylic  butyrate,  propionic  acid,  &c,  are 
formed  (§  565). 

Butyrates. — The  butyrates  are  soluble  in  water  and  alcohol,  are 
crystallisable,  and  smell  of  butyric  acid  when  moist.  Even  those 
readily  soluble  are  only  slowly  moistened  when  thrown  on  cold  water, 
and  exhibit  a  rotary  movement  during  solution. 

Calcic  butyrate,  Ca(O.CO.CH2.CH.2.CH3)2,H20,  is  dissolved  by 
three  and  a  half  times  its  weight  of  water  at  14°,  but  very  difficultly 
at  70°,  so  that  a  cold  saturated  solution,  when  heated  to  this  tem- 
perature, separates  nearly  all  its  salt  in  brilliant  leafy  crystals,  which 
disappear  again  on  cooling. 

Baric  butyrate,  Ba(O.C4H70)2,  crystallises  in  readily  soluble 
nacreous  plates. 

Argentic  butyrate,  AgO.C4H70,  is  precipitated  on  mixing  not  too 
dilute  solutions  of  other  butyrates  with  argentic  nitrate,  in  colourless 
scales,  which  require  more  than  400  parts  of  water  at  14°  for 
solution. 

On  mixing  solutions  of  butyrate  and  acetate  of  the  same  metal 
and  evaporating,  crystalline  compounds  are  frequently  obtained,  con- 
taining both  bodies  in  equal  molecules.  These  butyrato-acetates 
(which  are  polymeric  with  the  propionates)  appear  to  have  a  similar 
constitution  to  the  diacetates  (§  575)  :

2.  Isobutyric  acid,  ~tt3^>CH.CO.OH,  occurs  in  St.  John's  bread 

(the  fruit  of  Ceratonia  siliqua),  and  is  formed  from  isobutylic  alcohol 
or  isobutyric  aldehyde  on  oxidation,  also  from  isopropylic  cyanide  by 
boiling  with  acids  or  alkalies.  It  is  separated  as  an  oil  by  addition  of 
concentrated  sulphuric  acid  to  its  salts.     Its  sp.  gr.  is  "9503  at  20°.

It  boils  at  154°  and  requires  five  times  its  weight  of  water  at  20°  for 
solution.  It  is  readily  oxidised  by  chromic  and  sulphuric  acids  to 
acetic  acid  and  carbonic  anhydride. 

Calcic  isobutyrate,  Ca[O.CO.CH :  (CH3)2]2,5H20,  crystallises  in 
long  prisms,  which  dissolve  much  more  readily  in  hot  than  in  cold 
water. 

Argentic  isobutyrate,  AgO.CO.CH  :  (CH3)2,  crystallises  in  plates, 
which  require  110  parts  of  water  at  16°  for  solution.

have  been  prepared. 

1.  Normal  valeric  acid  is  formed  by  the  oxidation  of  normal  primary 
amylic  alcohol  and  by  boiling  normal  butylic  cyanide  with  alkalies. 
It  is  liquid,  smells  like  butyric  acid,  has  sp.  gr.  -9577  at  0°,  and  does 
not  solidify  at  —16°.  It  boils  at  184°-185°,  and  dissolves  in  twenty- 
eight  times  its  weight  of  water  at  16°. 

Baric  valerate,  Ba(O.CO.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH3)2,  crystallises  in 
plates,  which  dissolve  in  six  times  their  weight  of  water  at  10°. 

Calcic  valerate,  Ca(O.CO.C4H9)2,H20,  crystallises  in  fatty  leafy 
crystals,  dissolves  in  twelve  parts  of  water  at  20°,  and,  like  calcic 
but)  rate,  separates  in  great  part  on  heating  the  solution  to  70°. 

PIT 

2.  Isovaleric  acid,    pTT3^>CH.CH2.CO.OH,  occurs  in  the  roots  of 

Valeriana  and  Angelica  officinalis  (in  the  latter  together  with  angelic 
acid)  and  in  the  berries  and  bark  of  Viburnum  Opulis.  It  is  ob- 
tained from  these  parts  of  the  plants  by  fine  division  and  distillation 
with  water.  It  occurs  as  fat  in  the  tears  of  Delphinus  globiceps.  It 
is  formed  by  the  oxidation  of  fats  of  higher  homologous  acids  and  by 


VALERIC  ACIDS.  357 

the  putrefaction  of  albuminoids ;  e.g.  it  occurs  largely  in  rotten  cheese. 
It  is  obtained  synthetically  by  boiling  isobutylic  cyanide  with  alkalies 
and  by  oxidation  of  isoamylic  alcohol. 

This  succeeds  best  when  five  parts  of  potassic  dichromate  are 
placed  with  four  parts  of  water  in  a  retort  turned  upwards  and  pro- 
vided with  an  inverted  condenser,  and  a  mixture  of  one  part  of  fer- 
mentation amy  lie  alcohol  and  four  parts  of  sulphuric  acid  then  added. 
The  reaction  soon  starts  of  itself  with  lively  ebullition.  Later  it  is 
heated  to  boiling  until  no  oily  streaks  of  isoamylic  aldehyde  can  be  ob- 
served in  the  neck  of  the  retort  or  the  condenser.  The  retort  is  then 
turned  downwards,  and  the  valeric  acid,  together  with  water,  distilled 
over.  The  distiUate  is  saturated  with  sodic  hydrate,  the  oily  isoamylic 
isovalerate  which  separates  removed,  the  salt  solution  evaporated  to 
dryness  and  treated  with  four-fifths  of  its  weight  of  sulphuric  acid 
that  has  previously  been  diluted  with  half  the  quantity  of  water. 
The  oily  valeric  acid  is  then  separated,  dried  with  calcic  chloride,  and 
purified  by  distillation. 

Isovaleric  acid  is  a  thin,  colourless  oil  of  unpleasant  valerian-like 
odour.  It  has  sp.  gr.  "947  at  0°  ;  it  boils  at  175°.  The  anhydrous 
acid,  on  shaking  with  water,  takes  up  a  molecule  of  the  latter  : 

(CH3)2CH.CH2.CO.OH  +  OH2  =  (CH3)2CH.CH2.C(OH)3, 

yielding  isovaleryl  trihydrate,  which  is  not  completely  decomposed  on 
distillation  and  dissolves  in  thirty  parts  of  water. 

The  metallic  isovalerates  have  a  fatty  feeling,  smell  of  valeric  acid 
when  damp,  are  mostly  readily  soluble  in  water,  and  in  part  crystal- 
lise therefrom  with  difficulty. 

Baric  isovalerate,  Ba[O.CO.CH2.CH(CH3)2]2,H20,  forms  thin 
prisms  or  plates,  which  dissolve  in  two  parts  of  cold  water,  but  in  their 
own  weight  of  water  at  22°. 

Zincic  isovalerate,  Zn(O.C5H90)2,  forms  nacreous  scales,  which 
are  more  soluble  in  alcohol  than  in  water.     The  salt  is  officinal. 

Argentic  isovalerate,  AgO.C5H90,  crystallises  in  brilliant  leafy 
plates,  which  require  450  parts  of  water  for  solution. 

3.  Eth-meth-acetic  acid,  CH(CH3)(C2H5).CO.OH,  has  been  pre- 
pared synthetically  by  distilling  ethylic  eth-meth-aceto-acetate  with 
sodic  ethylate  and  saponification  of  the  ethylic  eth-meth-acetate 
so  formed.  The  same  acid  appears  to  be  formed  by  oxidation  of 
optically  active  fermentation  amylic  alcohol  (§  170)  with  potassic 
dichromate  and  sulphuric  acid.  Obtained  by  this  latter  method,  it 
rotates  the  plane  of  polarisation  strongly  to  the  right,  whilst  that 
prepared  synthetically  appears  to  be  optically  inactive.  Otherwise 
the  acids  from  both  sources  agree  in  properties.  Eth-meth-acetic 
acid  is  a  thin  liquid  of  boiling  point  173°.  The  argentic  salt  crystal- 
lises from  hot  water  in  feathery  needles ;  the  baric  salt  refuses  to 
crystallise,  leaving  a  gum-like  mass  on  evaporation. 

4.  Trimeth-acetic  acid,  pseudo-valeric  acid,  or  pinalic  acid, 
(CH3)3  j  COO. OH,  is  obtained  by  heating  trimethyl-carbin-cyanide 
with  alkalies,  or  better  with  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid,  to  100°, 
and  by  oxidation  of  pinacoline  (§  504,  3)  with  chromic  and  dilute 
sulphuric  acids.  The  crude  acid  is  converted  into  the  potassic  salt, 
this  evaporated  to  dryness,   and  decomposed   with   sulphuric  acid.

Triiueth-acetic  acid  then  separates  as  an  oil,  which  crystallises  on 
cooling. 

Trinietli-acetic  acid  forms  leafy  crystals,  melting  at  34°-35,  and 
boils  at  161°.  It  requires  forty  times  its  weight  of  water  for  solution. 
Its  baric  salt,  Ba[O.CO.C  j  (CH3)3]2,5H20,  and  calcic  salt  : 

Ca(O.C5H90)2,4H20, 

crystallise  in  silky  needles,  which  are  readily  soluble. 

Caproic  Acids,  or  Amyl  Carbonic  Acids,  C6H1202. 

584.  Of  the  eight  possible  isomeric  amyl  carbonic  acids  only  the 
following  have  vet  been  prepared : — 

1.  Normal  caproic  acid,  CH3.OHrC5H^CH2.CB[?.CO.OH,  occurs 

in  nature  partly  in  the  free  state  (in  sweat  and  in  the  blood  of 
Satyrinm  hircinnm),  partly  in  several  fats  as  glyceric  salts  (in  butter 
and  cocoa-nut  oil),  and  is  formed  from  albuminoids  and  acids  richer  in 
carbon  by  oxidation.  It  is  obtained  from  normal  primary  hexylic 
alcohol  by  chromic  and  sulphuric  acids,  and  from  normal  primary 
amylic  iodide  by  conversion  into  the  cyanide  and  decomposition  of 
this  latter  by  alkalies.  It  is  formed  also  in  pretty  considerable  quan- 
tity in  the  butyric  fermentation  of  sugar.  In  order  to  purify  it  the 
calcic  or  baric  salt  is  prepared,  reerystallised,  and  the  caproic  acid 
separated  by  addition  of  the  hydrochloric  acid. 

Caproic  acid  is  an  oily  liquid  of  faint,  unpleasant  odour,  not  mis- 
cible  with  water,  having  at  0°  sp.  gr.  '945.  On  strong  cooling  it 
solidifies  to  a  crystalline  mass,  which  melts  at  —2°.     It  boils  at  205°. 

Calcic  caproale.  Ca^O.CO.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH3)2,H20,  crystal- 
lises in  plates,  which  dissolve  in  36-37  parts  of  water  at  19°. 

Baric  caproate,  Ba(O.C6HnO)2,  requires  about  twelve  times  its 
weight  of  water  at  20°  for  solution. 

Argentic  caproate  is  nearly  insoluble  in  water. 

2.  Isocaproic  acid,  .-,tt3^CH.CH2.CH2.CO.OH,  or  isoamyl  car- 
bonic acid,  is  obtained  from  isoamylic  cyanide  by  decomposition  with 
alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  and  by  saponification  of  ethylic  aceto-iso- 
butvl  acetate.  It  is  an  oil  resembling  the  normal  acid,  of  sp.  gr. 
•931.  and  boiling  at  199^-200°. 

-.caproate,  Ca[O.CO.CH2.CH2.CH  :  (CH3)2],,3H20,  crys- 
tallises in  plates,  and  requires  nine  parte  of  water  at  18-5°  for 
solution. 

3.  If  the  secondary  isoamylic  iodide  be  heated  in  alcoholic  solution 
with  potassic  cyanide,  the  resulting  cyanide  decomposed  by  alkali, 
and  the  alkaline  salt  treated  with  acid,  methyl-i-soprcpyl  acetic  acid, 

p     3^>CH.CH<V^  ^tt.  is  obtained  in  the  free  state  as  an  oil  of 

fearful  odour,  which  has  been  little  investigated.  Its  calcic  salt  is 
difficultly  soluble  in  hot  water  and  crystallises  in  scales. 

PIT    PIT 

4.  Dieth-acetic  acid,  (,H3"p-rr2^>CH.CO.OH,  is  obtained  by  sa- 
ponification of  its  ethylic  salt,  which  latter  is  a  product  of  the  split- 
ting up  of  aceto-diethyl  acetate.  The  free  acid  is  an  oil  j  the  baric 
salt.    Ba[O.CO.CH(C2H5)2]2,   is   crystalline  and  readily  soluble   in 


FATTY  ACIDS.  359 

water.  The  argentic  salt,  AgO.CO.CH(C2H5)2,  is  also  soluble,  and 
crystallises  in  asbestos-like,  silky  needles. 

5.  Dimeth-eth-acetic  acid,  C(CH3)2(C2H5).CO.QH,  is  obtained 
by  heating  dimethyl-ethyl  car  bin-cyanide  with  strong  hydrochloric 
acid  at  100°.  It  is  a  colourless  liquid,  insoluble  in  water,  boiling 
at  187°. 

Baric  dimeth-eth-acetate,  (C5H11CO.O)2Ba,5H20,  crystallises  in 
large  transparent  plates.  The  zincic  salt  forms  transparent  prisms, 
and  the  silver  salt  fine  silky  needles. 

Heptylic  Acids,  or  Hexyl  Carbonic  Acids,  C7H1402. 

585.  Only  two  of  the  numerous  possible  hexyl  carbonic  acids  have 
been  accurately  investigated. 

Normal  heptylic  acid,  or  oznanthylic  acid : 

GH3.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH2.CH2.CO.OJEl, 

is  obtained  from  normal  primary  hexylic  iodide  by  conversion  into 
normal  primary  hexylic  cyanide  by  treatment  with  potassic  cyanide 
and  decomposition  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate,  and  also  by  the 
oxidation  of  normal  primary  heptylic  alcohol.  It  is  prepared  most 
readily  by  the  oxidation  of  its  aldehyde,  cenanthol  (§  400).  It  forms 
a  colourless  oil  of  faint  odour  and  of  sp.  gr.  '9345  at  0°,  solidifying 
in  the  cold  to  a  crystalline  mass,  melting  at  — 10-5°  and  boiling  at 
223°-224°. 

The  calcic  salt,  Ca(O.C7H130)2,H20,  crystallises  in  tufts  of 
needles,  which  dissolve  in  106  parts  of  water  at  8°. 

Isoenanthylic  arid,  probably  (CH3)2 :  CH.CH2.CH2.CH2.CO.OH, 
is  prepared  by  oxidation  of  isoenanthylic  alcohol.  It  is  a  colourless, 
oily  liquid  of  peculiar  and  disagreeable  odour;  it  boils  at  210°-213°. 

Another  isoenanthylic  acid,  boiling  at  220°,  is  obtained  by  heating 
a  mixture  of  sodic  ethylate  and  isovalerate  in  carbonic  oxide. 

Acids  Richer  in  Carbon. 

586.  In  most  cases  only  one  representative  of  each  higher  mem- 
ber of  the  series  is  known,  although  the  number  of  possible  isomers 
increases  enormously  with  each  additional  carbon  atom.  With  few 
exceptions  they  are  prepared  from  the  fats,  and  those  so  obtained 
appear  to  be  normal  acids,  CH3(CH2)nCO.OH,  as  on  oxidation  with 
chromic  and  sulphuric  acids  they  yield  normal  acids  poorer  in  carbon. 
They  are  insoluble  in  water,  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether,  and  are 
crystallisable.  Their  alkali  salts  are  true  soaps,  i.e.  dissolve  in  little 
water  to  a  clear  solution,  but  are  partially  decomposed  by  much 
water,  with  clouding  and  liberation  of  some  alkali,  to  liquids  which 
froth  strongly  on  shaking.  The  other  metallic  salts  are  most  diffi- 
cultly soluble  or  insoluble  in  water,  but  mostly  soluble  in  alcohol. 

587.  Octylic  or  caprylic  acid,  C8H1602  =  C7H15.CO.OH,  the  car- 
bonic acid  of  normal  primary  heptyl,  is  prepared  by  oxidation  of 
normal  primary  octylic  alcohol  (§  173),  and  occurs  in  wine  fusel  oils, 
as  a  fat  in  butter,  in  cocoa-nut  oil,  and  in  other  vegetable  fats. 

Caprylic  acid  crystallises  in  fine  needles  or  plates,  which  melt 
between  16°  and  17°  and  smell  like  sweat.     It  boils  at  232°-234°. 


360  DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  ACID  RADICALS,   CnE2n_1. 

Its  baric  salt  requires  fifty  parts  of  cold,  and  more  than  100  parts  of 
hot,  water  for  solution. 

An  iso-octylic  acid,  C(CH3)3.CH2.CH(CH3).CO.OH,  is  prepared 
by  oxidation  of  diisobutylene  ;  it  is  an  oily  liquid,  boiling,  apparently 
with  some  decomposition,  at  205°-218°. 

588.  Nonylic  acid,  or pelargonic  acid,  C9HI802  =  C8H17.CO.OH, 
occurs  in  the  essential  oil  of  Pelargonium  roseum,  and  is  obtained  by 
oxidation  of  methyl-nonyl  ketone,  the  essential  oil  of  Ruta  graveolens 
(§  455),  with  nitric  acid,  and  also  by  acting  on  ethylic  heptyl  aceto- 
acetate  with  solid  potassic  hydrate  and  acidulation  of  the  resulting 
salt.     It  is  solid  below  12°  and  boils  at  253°-254°. 

M ethyl-he  xy  I  acetic  acid,  C6H15.CH(CH3).CO.OH,  is  prepared 
from  the  cyanide  derived  from  methyl-hexyl  carbinol.  It  is  a  colour- 
less oil,  boiling  at  245°. 

589.  Capric  acid,  C10H20O2  =  C9H19.CO.OH,  occurs  as  glyceric 
salt  in  butter,  in  cocoa-nut  oil,  and  all  fats  which  contain  caproic  or 
caprylic  acids.  It  is  solid  and  crystalline,  melts  at  30°,  boils  at  270°, 
and  has  a  faint,  goat-like  odour.  The  baric  salt  is  scarcely  soluble 
even  in  hot  water. 

590.  Undecylic  acid,  CHH2202  =  C10II2i.CO.OH,  obtained  by 
the  oxidation  of  methyl-undecyl  ketone  (§  455a),  melts  at  28*5°  and 
boils  at  212°-213°  under  a  pressure  of  100  mm. 

591.  Laurie  acid,  C12H2402  =  C13H23CO.OH,  obtained  from  the 
fat  of  pichurium  beans,  the  fruit  of  Laurus  nobilis,  butter,  cocoa-nut 
oil,  &c,  crystallises  in  spear-like,  silky  needles,  which  melt  at  43'6° 
and  have  sp.  gr.  *883.  It  boils  at  225*5°  under  a  pressure  of  100 
mm.,  but  is  partially  decomposed  on  distillation  at  ordinary  pressures. 

592.  Tridecylic  acid,  C13H2602  =  C12H25.CO.OH,  obtained  by 
oxidation  of  methyl-tridecyl  ketone  (§  4556),  melts  at  45°  and  solidi- 
fies a  little  below  this  to  scaly  crystals.  It  boils  at  236°  under  a 
pressure  of  1 00  mm. 

593.  Myristicacid,  C14H2802  =  C13H27.CO.OH,  forms  a  glyceric 
salt,  the  chief  constituent  of  muscat  butter  (the  fat  of  the  fruit  of 
Myristica  moschata),  but  is  also  prepared  from  spermaceti,  cocoa-nut 
oil,  and  other  fats.  It  crystallises  from  alcohol  in  silky  needles, 
which  melt  at  54°.     Under  a  pressure  of  100  mm.  it  boils  at  248°. 

594.  Pentadecylic  acid,  C15H30O2  =  C14H29.CO.OH,  prepared 
by  the  oxidation  of  m  ethyl-pen  tadecyl  ketone  (§  455c),  forms  nacre- 
ous scales,  which  melt  at  51°  and  boil  at  257°  under  a  pressure  of 
100  mm. 

595.  Palmitic  acid,  C16H3202  =  C15H31.CO.OH,  occurs  as  a  gly- 
ceric salt  in  nearly  all  animal  and  vegetable  fats.  In  the  solid 
animal  fats  it  occurs  mostly  with  stearic  and  oleic  acids,  in  olive  oil  . 
with  little  but  the  latter.  It  is  obtained  from  its  mixture  with 
stearic  acid  (stearine  candles'  material)  by  the  method  of  fractional 
precipitation  (§  563),  and  more  readily  from  olive  oil.  This  is  saponi- 
fied by  boiling  with  sodic  hydrate,  when  the  thick  solution  contains 
glycerine  and  the  soda  soaps  of  oleic  and  palmitic  acids.  These  are 
precipitated  on  saturating  the  water  with  common  salt,  separated 
from  the  salt  solution,  dissolved  in  pure  water,  and  precipitated  by 
addition  of  plumbic  acetate  as  plumbic  oleate  and  palmitate  (lead 
plaster).     From  this  mixture  the  plumbic  oleate  is  completely  removed 


FATTY  ACIDS.  361 

by  extraction  with  ether,  and  the  residual  plumbic  palmitate  decom- 
posed by  alcoholic  hydrochloric  acid.  The  alcoholic  liquid,  filtered 
from  plumbic  chloride,  yields,  when  precipitated  with  water,  nearly 
pure  palmitic  acid,  which  must  be  recrystallised  several  times  from 
alcohol. 

Palmitic  acid  is  also  obtained  by  heating  cetylic  alcohol  with  solid 
alkalies : 

C15H31.CH2.OH  +  HOK  =  2H2  +  C15H31.CO.OK, 

and  from  oleic  acid  by  heating  with  potassic  hydrate. 

Palmitic  acid  crystallises  in  needles,  which  melt  at  62°  and  re- 
solidify in  leafy  crystals  on  cooling ;  it  boils  at  268*5°  under  a  pres- 
sure of  100  mm. 

The  alkaline  salts  are  soluble  in  alcohol  and  little  water,  and  are 
true  soaps ;  all  other  metals  yield  insoluble  soaps  with  palmitic  acid. 

An  isomeric  acid,  diJteptyl  acetic  acid,  CH(C7H,5)2.CO.OH,  is 
prepared  by  action  of  ethylic  dihcptyl  aceto-acetate  on  solid  potassic 
hydrate.  It  forms  a  paraffin-like  mass,  melting  at  26°-  27°  and  boil- 
ing at  240°-250°  under  80-90  mm.  pressure. 

596.  Margaric  acid,  cetyl  carbonic  acid  : 

C17H34O2  =  C15H31.CH2.CO.OH, 

is  obtained  from  cetylic  cyanide  by  boiling  with  potassic  hydrate 
solution,  and  also  by  oxidation  of  methyl-heptadecyl  ketone  (§  455c). 
It  resembles  palmitic  acid,  melts  at  59'9°,  and  boils  at  277°  under  a 
pressure  of  100  mm. 

597.  Stearic  ac?<7,  C18H3602,  or  C17H35.CO.OH,  occurs  especially 
in  the  solid  animal  fats,  and,  mixed  with  palmitic  acid,  forms  the 
material  used  for  making  stearine  candle*.  To  prepare  this  latter, 
solid  animal  fats  are  heated  with  water,  to  which  a  very  small  quan- 
tity of  sulphuric  acid  has  been  added,  for  some  time  to  200°. 
According  to  the  equation  : 

CBH6(O.Cn-E2a_lO)3  +  3H20  =  C3H5(OH)3  +  3HO.CnH2n_10, 

the  fats  are  decomposed  into  glycerine,  which  remains  dissolved  in 
the  excess  of  water,  and  a  mixture  of  stearic,  palmitic,  and  oleic  acid-. 
which  float  on  the  surface  of  the  liquid.  This  is  removed  after  solidi- 
fication, and  strongly  compressed  by  hydraulic  presses,  first  at  ordi- 
nary temperature,  later  at  30°-40°,  in  order  to  remove  the  liquid 
oleic  acid.  The  mixture  of  solid  acids  melts  at  a  lower  temperature 
than  palmitic  acid,  and,  after  addition  of  some  wax  or  paraffin  to 
hinder  crystallisation,  is  employed  for  stearine  candles. 

Pure  stearic  acid,  which  can  be  prepared  from  this  mixture  by  the 
method  of  fractional  precipitation,  melts  at  69*2°,  solidifies  in  scaly 
crystals,  and  is  obtained  from  alcoholic  solutions  in  brilliant  plates. 

At  ordinary  pressure  stearic  acid  only  distils  with  decomposition  : 
at  a  pressure  of  100  mm.  it  distils  unaltered  at  287°,  and  also  passes 
over  at  250°-350°  in  a  current  of  super-heated  steam. 

A  fused  and  resolidified  mixture  of  equal  molecules  of  stearic  and 
palmitic  acid,  which  contains  the  elements  in  the  same  proportion  as 
margaric  acid  : 

"^18^36^2  +  C16H3202  =  C34H6804  =  2C17H3402, 


362  DERIVATIVES   OF  THE  ACID  RADICALS,   CnH2n_x. 

was  taken  for  margaric  acid  before  the  method  of  fractional  precipi- 
tation was  known.  It  melts  at  about  60°  and  solidifies  to  a  needle- 
formed  crystalline  mass.  A  mixture  of  two  parts  palmitic  acid  and 
one  part  stearic  acid  fuses  at  55°. 

598.  Arachidic  acid,  C20H40O2,  is  found  in  the  fat  of  earth  nut 
(Arachis  hypogaea),  in  butter,  and  some  other  fats.  It  crystallises  in 
brilliant  plates,  which  melt  at  75°. 

599.  Behenic  acid,  C22H4402,  prepared  from  oil  of  ben,  the  fat  of 
the  fruit  of  Moving a-nux  Behen,  melts  at  76°. 

600.  Hyaenic  acid,  C25H50O2,  is  separated  from  the  fat  of  the 
glandular  pouches  of  Hyaena  striata  as  an  acid  melting  at  77°. 

601.  Cerotic  acid,  C27H5402,  forms  the  chief  constituent  of  bees'- 
wax,  and  is  extracted  therefrom  by  boiling  with  ether,  whilst  mellis- 
sylic  palmitate  remains  undissolved.  On  cooling  the  hot  filtered 
liquid,  crude  cerotic  acid  separates,  and  is  collected  on  a  filter  and 
pressed.  It  is  then  dissolved  in  hot  alcohol,  precipitated  with  plumbic 
acetate,  and  the  crude  plumbic  cerotate  so  obtained  purified  by  treat- 
ment with  alcohol  and  ether.  It  is  decomposed  by  hot  acetic  acid, 
and  the  separated  cerotic  acid  recrystallised  from  alcohol. 

It  is  also  obtained  by  the  saponification  of  Chinese  wax  (cerylic 
cerotate),  and  by  oxidation  of  cerylic  alcohol  by  fusing  with  potassic 
hydrate. 

Cerotic  acid  crystallises  from  alcohol  in  small  grains,  which  melt 
at  79°. 

602.  Mellissic  acid,  C30H60O2,  is  prepared  by  oxidation  of  mellis- 
sylic  alcohol  with  fused  alkalies  : 

C29H59.CH2.OH  +  HOK  =  2H2  +  C29H59.CO.OK. 

It  is  an  indistinctly  crystalline,  wax-like  substance,  melting  at  91°. 

Halogen  Compounds  of  the  Acidoxyls. 

603.  The  organic  salts  are  not  altered  by  the  halogen  hydro-acids 
even  in  the  absence  of  water ;  in  the  latter  case,  however,  if  phosphoric 
anhydride  be  also  present,  reaction  occurs.  A  mixture  of  glacial  acetic 
acid  and  phosphoric  anhydride  yields  acetyl  chloride  when  heated 
with  dry  hydrochloric  acid  gas  : 

CH3.CO.OH  +  P205  +  HC1  =  2HP03  +  CH3.CO.Cl. 

The  acid  chlorides  are  obtained  more  readily  by  the  action  of  the 
halogen  compounds  of  phosphorus  on  the  acids  or  their  anhydrides. 

Phosphoric  chloride  or  bromide  react  with  one  molecule  of  the 
acid,  yielding  phosphoric  oxy-haloid,  acid  oxy-baloid,  and  halogen  hydro- 
acid,  the  reaction  starting  at  the  ordinary  temperature  and  evolving 
much  heat  : 

CnH2n+1.CO.OH  +  PC15  =POCl3  +  CnH2n  +  1.CO.Cl  +  HC1. 

For  this  purpose  phosphoric  chloride  is  placed  in  a  retort,  whose 
neck  is  turned  up  and  attached  to  an  inverted  condenser ;  the  acid  is 
then  allowed  to  flow  in  slowly  through  a  funnel  tube  provided  with  a 
stop  cock,  and  passed  through  the  tubulus  of  the  retort.  After 
completion  of  the  reaction  the  liquid  products  are  separated  by  frac- 
tional distillation. 


ACIDOXYL  HALOIDS.  363 

On  bringing  together  one  molecule  of  a  phosphoric  oxy-trihaloid  and 
two  molecules  of  a  dried  alkali  salt  of  an  organic  acid,  an  energetic 
reaction  ensues,  in  which  acidoxyl  haloid,  metallic  haloid,  and  meta- 
phosphate  are  formed : 

POCI3  +  2NaO.CO.Cn,H2n,+  1  =  NaO.P02  +  NaCl 
+  2Cl.CO.Cn,H2n,+  1. 

The  reactions  between  phosphorus  trihaloids  and  acids,  which  can 
also  be  employed,  require  to  be  assisted  by  heat,  but,  from  the  non- 
formation  of  any  volatile  phosphorus  compound,  yield  the  pure 
acidoxyl  haloid  on  careful  distillation. 

Acidoxyl  iodides  cannot  be  prepared  from  the  acids  themselves, 
as  these,  on  treatment  with  phosphorus  iodide,  yield  iodine,  and  are 
further  decomposed ;  but  by  treatment  of  the  acid  anhydrides  with 
phosphorus  triiodide,  the  acidoxyl  iodides  are  formed,  e.g. 

3(CH3.CO)20  +  2PI3  =  P203  +  6CH3.CO.I, 

the  phosphorus  trioxide  then  acting  further  on  a  portion  of  the  an- 
hydride. 

Instead  of  employing  the  haloid  compounds  of  phosphorus,  the 
dried  acids  or  anhydrides  may  be  mixed  with  amorphous  phosphorus 
and  then  treated  with  the  halogen. 

604.  The  acidoxyl  haloids  are  mostly  heavy  liquids  which  fume  in 
the  air.  When  added  to  water,  they  generally  sink  in  oily  globules, 
but  soon  decompose  with  it  into  halogen  hydro-acid  and  fatty  acid, 
the  reaction  being  generally  violent : 

CnH2n+1.CO.Cl  +  H20  =  CnH.2n+1.CO.OH  +  HC1. 
CH3.CO.I  +  H20  =  CH3.CO.OH  +  HI. 

The  halogen  is  much  less  firmly  united  to  carbon  in  these  com- 
pounds than  in  the  alkyl  haloids,  which  do  not  contain  oxygen  united 
to  the  same  carbon  atom.  In  this  respect  the  halogen  compounds  of 
oxygenated  organic  radicals  behave  like  those  of  the  inorganic  acid 
radicals. 

The  reaction  of  the  acid  haloids  upon  alcohols  is  similar  to  that 
with  water,  as  the  alcoholic  salt  of  the  acid  and  halogen  hydro-acid 
are  formed  with  much  evolution  of  heat ;  or,  if  excess  of  alcohol  be 
present,  the  latter  forms  with  it  alkyl  haloid  and  water.  The  first 
reaction  occurs  according  to  the  equation  : 

CnH2n+1.OH+  Cl.CO.Cn-H2ir+1  =HC1  +  CnH2n+1.O.CO.Cn<H2n,+1. 

605.  Formyl  haloids  are  not  known.  If,  for  instance,  phosphoric 
pentachloride  reacts  on  pure  formic  acid,  carbonic  oxide  is  evolved  : 

H.CO.OH  +  PC15  =  POCl3  +  HC1  +  HCO.C1  =  P0013 
+  2HC1  +  CO. 

606.  Acetyl  Haloids. — Acetic  chloride,  or  chlor-acetyl,  CH3.CO.Cl, 
is  a  colourless  liquid  of  penetrating  odour,  fuming  in  the  air,  has 
sp.  gr.  1*125,  and  boils  at  55°.  It  first  sinks  in  water,  but  soon  de- 
composes with  violence  into  acetic  and  hydrochloric  acids.  Acetic 
bromide,  or  brom-acetyl,  CH3.CO.Br,  resembles  the  chloride,  but  boils 
at  81°.     Acetic  iodidef  or  iodo-acetyl,  CH3.CO.I,  is  a  liquid  boiling  at 


364  DERIVATIVES   OE  THE   ACID   RADICALS,   C^^,. 

108°;  it  is  always  coloured  brown  by  free  iodine,  and  decomposes  on 
exposure  to  light  with  separation  of  iodine  and  further  changes  of  the 
organic  residue. 

607.  Propionic  chloride,  or  chlor-propionyl,  CH3.CH2.C0.C1, 
boils  at  80°,  propionic  bromide  at  96°-98°,  and  propionic  iodide, 
CH3.CH2.CO.I,  at  127°-128°.     All  three  fume  on  exposure  to  air. 

Butyric  chloride,  or  chlor-butyryl,  CH3.CH2.CH2.C0.C1,  boils  at 
101° ;  isobutyric  chloride,  (CH3)2CH.C0.C1,  at  92°. 

Isovaleric  chloride,  or  chlor-isovaleryl,  boils  at  115°,  and  has  sp.  gr. 
1-005  at  6°. 

Ethereal  Salts. 

608.  Methods  of  Preparation. — On  mixing  a  fatty  acid  with 
alcohol,  only  a  feeble  and  incomplete  reaction  occurs  ;  on  heating  the 
mixture  to  higher  temperatures  it  occurs  to  a  greater  degree,  so  that 
considerable  quantities  of  the  salt,  together  with  water,  are  formed,  but 
even  then  considerable  quantities  of  the  ingredients  remain  unaltered. 
The  process  is  represented  by  the  following  equation  : 

aCnH2n+1.OH  +  aHO.CO.Cn,H2n,+  1  =  6H20 

+  5CnH2n+l.O.CO.Cn,H2n.+  1 
+  (*  -  &)(CnH2n  +  1.OH  +  HO.CO.Cn,H2n,+  1). 

By  employment  of  an  excess  of  alcohol  an  increased  quantity  of 
acid,  by  an  excess  of  acid  a  larger  quantity  of  alcohol,  can  be  converted 
into  the  salt. 

The  yield  of  salt  is  increased  by  the  presence  of  bodies  which  can 
combine  with  the  resulting  water,  such  as  sulphuric  acid  or  hydrochloric 
acid  gas  ;  but  the  action  of  these  acids  does  not  cease  with  combination 
with  water,  but,  especially  with  sulphuric  acid,  they  take  part  in  the 
reaction,  combining  with  the  alcohol. 

In  preparing  ethereal  salts  which  volatilise  unchanged,  a  mixture 
of  alcohol  and  free  acids  or  their  salts  is  distilled  after  addition  of 
sulphuric  acid.  The  latter  partly  forms  with  the  alcohol  monalkyl 
sulphate,  which  at  higher  temperatures  reacts  with  organic  acids 
similarly  to  its  reaction  with  alcohol  and  water  (§  215) : 

(CnH2n  +  1)HS04  +  HO.CO.Cn,H2n,+  1  =  CnH2n+1.O.CO.Cn,H2n,+  1 

Ethereal  salt. 

+  H2S04. 

Volatile  ethereal  salts  are  also  similarly  obtained  by  the  dry  distilla- 
tion of  an  intimate  mixture  of  the  alkali  salts  of  fatty  acids  with 
potassic  alkyl  sulphates : 

CnH2n+lKS04  +  KO.CkHsn^O  =  K2S04 

+  CnH-jn^O.Cn'H^^O. 

The  alcohols  react  very  completely  with  acids  when  hydrochloric 
acid  gas  is  passed  to  saturation  into  a  mixture  of  the  two.  In  the 
main  the  hydrochloric  acid  acts  by  uniting  with  the  water,  but  also 
converts  a  portion  of  the  alcohol  into  alkyl  chloride,  of  which  a  certain 
quantity  acts  further  as  follows  : 

CnH2n  +  1.Cl  +HO.CO.Cn-H2n,+  l  =HC1  +  CnH2n+1.O.CO.CnH2n>1. 


ETHEREAL  SALTS.  365 

This  method  is  especially  applicable  when  an  insoluble  salt  of  high 
boiling  point  is  to  be  prepared  from,  an  alcohol  miscible  with  water. 
After  standing  for  several  days  the  excess  of  alcohol  is  in  great  part 
distilled  off,  and  the  residue  shaken  with  water.  This  removes  alcohol 
and  hydrochloric  acid,  whilst  the  ethereal  salt  separates  and  is  puri- 
fied either  by  distillation  or,  if  solid,  by  crystallisation. 

The  following  are  also  methods  of  general  application  : — 
An  alkyl  haloid  is  heated  with  the  potassic  or  argentic  salt  of  the 
acid  at  100°,  best  in  the  presence  of  some  alcohol  : 

CnH2n  +  1Cl  +  KO.Cn.Han._iO  =  KC1  +  CnH2n+1.O.Cn-H2n._10. 

CnH2n+1I  +  AgO.Cn.H2n._jO  =  Agl  +  CnH2n+1.O.Cn.H2n._10. 

The  acid  chlorides  react  with  great  energy  on  the  alcohols  yielding 
ethereal  salts : 

CnH2n+1.OH  +  Cl.CO.Cn,H2n.+  1  =CnH2n  +  1.O.CO.Cn-H2n.+  1+HCl. 

609.  Reactions  of  the  Ethereal  Salts. — If  not  of  very  high  molecular 
weight  they  are  mostly  liquids,  distinguished,  as  a  rule,  from  their 
constituent  acids  and  alcohols  by  their  agreeable  odours.  Many  of 
them  occur  naturally,  and  impart  to  fruit,  flowers,  &c,  their  character- 
istic odour. 

Solid  crystalline  ethereal  salts  of  high  molecular  weight  also  occur 
naturally,  forming  the  chief  constituents  of  the  various  kinds  of  wax. 

Treated  with  much  water,  and  especially  on  heating,  the  ethereal 
salts  are  reconverted  into  acid  and  alcohol : 

aGnH2n  +  1.O.Cn.H2n_iO  +&H20  =  cCnH2n  +  ^OH  +  cHO.Cn.H^^O 

+  (a-c)CnH2n  +  1O.Cn-H2n-_iO  +  (6-c)H20; 

the  reaction  being  effected  more  readily  and  completely  on  heating 
with  strong  bases : 

CnHan+ACnHan.iO  +  KOH  =  KO.Cn.Han.^0  +  CnH2n  +  1OH. 

As  already  mentioned,  this  process  is  termed  saponification. 

Ammonia,  even  in  the  presence  of  water,  converts  them  into 
alcohol  and  acid  amide  : 

CnH2n+1O.CO.Cn.H2n.+  1  +  NH3  =  CnH2n+1.OH 
+  NH2.CO.Cn.H2n'+1. 
Phosphoric  chloride   decomposes   the   ethereal    salts    into   alkyl 
chlorides  and  acid  chlorides  : 

CnH2n+1.O.Cn.H2n'-,0  +  PC15  =  POCI3  +  CnH2n+1Cl 
+  ClCn,H2n._10. 

By  action  of  bromine  and  chlorine,  substitution  products  are 
formed  (with  elimination  of  hydro-acids),  in  which  even  all  the  hy- 
drogen atoms  can  be  replaced  by  halogen.  For  this  complete  replace- 
ment the  assistance  of  light  and  heat  is  requisite. 

Ethereal  Salts  of  the  Mon-hydric  Alcohols. 

610.  A  very  large  number  of  cases  of  metamerism  occur  amongst 
the  salts  of  this  group,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  alcohols  and 
acids.     In  addition  to  this  they  are  further  metameric  with  the  mono- 


366  DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  ACID  RADICALS,   CnH^^. 

basic  acids,  the  general  formula  of  the  ethereal  salts  being  the  same  as 
that  of  the  fatty  acids,  CnH2n02  : 

Cn»H2n'+i«O.CO.C'n»H2n''+1  =  ^w  +  n"+i^-2\n'  +  n"+  l)02

In  comparison  with  the  metameric  acids  the  ethers  always  boil  at 
lower  temperatures  and  are  less  soluble  in  water.  These  liquids  mix 
with  alcohol  and  ether  in  every  proportion. 

611.  Methylic  formate,  CH3.O.CHO,  metameric  with  acetic  acid, 
is  best  obtained  by  distillation  of  sodic  formate  with  potassic  methyl 
sulphate.     It  is  a  mobile,  colourless  liquid,  boiling  at  36°. 

612.  C3H602.  Ethylic  formate,  C2H5O.CHO,  is  obtained  by  dis- 
tillation of  seven  parts  of  dried  sodic  formate  with  six  parts  of  90  % 
alcohol  and  ten  parts  of  sulphuric  acid,  or  better  by  heating  glycerine 
with  oxalic  acid  and  alcohol  in  a  vessel  provided  with  an  inverted 
condenser  (comp.  §  567).  It  boils  at  55°  and  dissolves  in  ten  times 
its  weight  of  water. 

Methylic  acetate,  CH3.O.CO.CH3,  occurs  ready  formed  in  crude 
wood  spirit.  It  boils  at  56°  and  has  sp.  gr.  -956  at  0°.  The  first 
chlor  substitution  product  is  metheneaceto-chloride,  Cl.CH2.O.CO.CH3, 
an  oil  boiling  at  115°-116°,  which  on  heating  with  water  is  converted 
into  acetic  and  hydrochloric  acids  and  methylic  aldehyde. 

613.  C4H802.  Propylic  formate,  CH3.CH2.CH2.O.CO.H,  boils  at 
82-5°-83°. 

Ethylic  acetate,  CH3.CH2.O.CO.CH3,  is  best  prepared  by  distilling 
ten  parts  of  sodic  acetate  with  a  mixture  of  fifteen  parts  of  sulphuric 
acid  and  six  parts  of  alcohol.  In  order  to  remove  any  alcohol  from 
the  distillate,  it  is  shaken  several  times  with  small  quantities  of  a 
saturated  solution  of  common  salt,  and  the  acetate  then  separated  and 
dried  by  distillation  over  calcic  chloride. 

Pure  ethylic  acetate  is  a  clear  thin  liquid  of  refreshing  odour, 
boiling  at  72°-74°  and  dissolving  in  about  eleven  times  its  weight  of 
water,  the  latter  soon  partially  decomposing  it  into  acid  and  alcohol. 
It  has  sp.  gr.  '9068  at  15°. 

On  adding  sodium  to  perfectly  pure  ethylic  acetate  it  dissolves 
with  heating  and  evolution  of  but  little  gas  to  a  mixture  of  sodic 
ethylate  and  ethylic  aceto-sod -acetate  (see  ketonic  acids). 

Methylic  propionate  is  not  known.

C10H20O2.  Hexylic  butyrate,  C6H13O.C4H70,  and  octylic  acetate, 
C8H17O.C2H30,  form  together  that  part  of  the  oil  of  Heracleum

619.  The  ethylic  salts  of  the  acids  richer  in  carbon  are  all  prepared 
by  saturation  of  their  alcoholic  solutions  with  hydrochloric  acid ;  they 
are  crystallisable,  wax-like,  brilliant,  colourless  masses. 

Ethylicpalmitate,C255.O.Cl6K3lO, melts  at  24*2° ;  ethylic  stearate,

620.  The  highest  members  of  this  series  form  the  chief  constituents 
of  vegetable  and  animal  wax. 

Cetylic  palmitate,  C16H33.O.C16H310.  Spermaceti  coDsists  in 
great  part  of  this  substance.  It  is  obtained  by  crystallisation  and 
pressing  from  the  oil  occurring  in  the  bones  of  the  skull  of  certain 
species  of  whales  (Physeter  macrocephalus  and  Delphinus),  and  forms 
a  colourless  mass  of  leafy  crystals  of  waxy  lustre.  In  the  pure  state 
it  melts  at  49°. 

Bees'-wax  is  a  mixture  of  several  bodies,  which  are  partially 
soluble  (chiefly  cerotic  acid),  partially  insoluble  in  boiling  alcohol. 
The  chief  ingredient  of  this  latter  portion  is  mellissylic  palmitate, 
C30H61.O.C16H31O  (comp.  §  179). 

Chinese  wax,  a  body  of  leafy  crystalline  fracture,  consists  of  cerylic 
cerotate,  C27H55.O.C27H530. 

A  variety  of  wax  is  obtained  by  extracting  meadow  hay  with  hot 
alcohol ;  it  consists  of  mellissylic  mellissate  : 

C6oH12002  =  C30H61O.C30H59O. 

Wax-like  substances  are  widely  diffused  in  plants — e.g.  on  the  sur- 
face of  green  leaves,  stalks,  and  many  fruits  (pears,  apples,  cherries, 
&c.)     These  still  require  investigation. 


ETHEREAL  SALTS.  369 

Salts  of  the  Fatty  Acids  with  the  Diad  Radicals,  CnH2n. 

621.  Alkylidene  Salts. — The  more  important  of  these  compounds 
have  already  been  mentioned,  more  especially  the  formation  and  pro- 
perties of  methene  diacetate,  CH2  :(O.C2H30)2  (§389);  ethylidene 
diacetate,  CH3.CH :  (O.C2H30)2,  boiling  point  169°  (§  393) ;  and  ethy- 
Udene  aceto-chloride,  CH3.CHC1.0.C2H30,  boiling  at  120°-124°. 

622.  The  salts  of  the  olefines  have  already  been  mentioned  as  in- 
termediate products  between  the  olefine  haloids  and  the  glycols.  In 
their  formation  and  decomposition  they  resemble  the  salts  of  the 
alkyls,  but  from  the  diad  nature  of  their  radicals  exhibit  some  modi- 
fication, especially  in  the  methods  of  preparation. 

On  heating  a  glycol  with  a  fatty  acid,  a  basic  salt  is  first 
obtained  : 

CnH2n(OH).O.Cn,H2n_10, 

for  whose  conversion  into  the  neutral  salt  a  considerably  higher  tem- 
perature and  excess  of  acid  is  requisite. 

In  the  reaction  between  olefine  dihaloids  and  salts  of  the  fatty 
acids,  normal  ethereal  salts  only  are  formed,  when  the  free  acid  itself 
is  also  present.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  alcohol  be  employed  as  a  sol- 
vent, only  basic  salts  of  the  olefine  and  alkyl  salts  are  formed  (§  483). 

On  adding  acidoxyl  chlorides  to  the  glycols,  an  energetic  reaction 
ensues,  whose  chief  product  is  an  olefine  chloro  salt : 

CH2.OH  CH2.O.C2H30 

+  Cl.CO.CH3  =  I  +  H20 

CH2.OH  CH2.C1 

The  same  product  is  also  formed  in  considerable  quantity  when  hy- 
drochloric acid  gas  is  passed  into  a  mixture  of  a  glycol  with  an  excess 
of  an  organic  acid  : 

CH2.OH  CH2.O.C2H30 

+  2HO.C2H30  +  2HC1  =  |  +  H20 

CH2.OH  CH3.CI 

+  HO.C2H30  +  HC1. 

Acid  anhydrides  yield  either  basic  or  normal  salts  with  the  glycols, 
according  to  the  proportions  of  the  ingredients  employed  : 

CnH2n(OH)2  +  (Cn-H2n^_10)20  =  CnH2n(OH).O.Cn.H2n,_10 
+  HO.CVH^O 
CnH2n(OH)2  +  2(Cn,H2n,_10)20  =  CnH2n(O.Cn-H2n_10)2 
+  2HO.Cn,H2n,_10. 

Whilst  the  ethers  or  dialkyl  oxides  scarcely  react  with  organic  acids, 
the  olefine  oxides  readily  combine  with  them,  forming  basic  salts  : 

CH2V  CH2.O.C2H30 

I        >0  +  HO.C2H30  =  I 
CH/  CH2.OH 

and  with  equal  readiness  with  the  anhydrides  forming  the  normal  salts  : 

CH2V  CH2.O.C2H30 

I       >0  +  0(C2H30)2=  I 
CH/  CH2.O.C2H30

623.  The  acetates  are  best  known  of  these  compounds.  A  short 
notice  of  the  characteristics  of  some  few  members  will  suffice. 

Ethylene  hydrate  acetate  is  a  liquid  miscible  with  water,  boiling  at 
182°.  Ethylene  diacetate  requires  seven  times  its  weight  of  water  for 
solution,  and  boils  at  186°.  Ethylene  aceto-chloride  is  readily  pre- 
pared by  action  of  hydrochloric  acid  gas  on  the  basic  acetate  : 

CH2.O.C2H30  CH2.O.C2H30 

|  +  HOI  =   |  +  H20 

CH2.OH  CH2.C1 

and  by  heating  ethylene  hydrate  chloride  with  acetic  anhydride  to 

110°: 

CH2.OH  CH2.O.C2H30 

|  .+  0.(C2H30)2  =  |  +  HO.C2H30 

CH2.C1  CH2.C1 

it  is  isomeric  with  ethylidene  aceto-chloride,  and  bt>ilsat  195°. 

The  basic  salt  yields  with  hydrobromic  acid  gas  ethylene  bromo- 
acetate,  Br.CH2.CH2.O.C.2H30,  and  with  hydriodic  acid  ethylene  ace- 
to-iodide,  which  cannot  be  distilled  without  decomposition,  and  which 
is  readily  converted  into  ethylic  acetate  by  excess  of  hydriodic  acid  : 

I.CH2.CH2.O.C2H30  -f-  HI  =  I2  +  CH3.CH2  O.C2H30. 

The  three  haloid  acetates  of  ethylene  are  liquids  which  sink  in  water, 
and  on  saponification  yield  ethylene  oxide  : 

CH2.O.C2H30  KO.C2H30  CH2. 

I  +  2KOH  =  +  H20  +  |        >0 

CH2.C1  KC1  CH/ 

The  following  basic  ethylene  salts  are  also  known  : — Ethylene 
hydrate  butyrate,  C2H4(OH).O.C4H70,  boiling  point  220°  ;  the  iso- 
valerate,  C2H4(OH).O.C5H90,  boiling  point  about  240°.  The  neutral 
butyrate,  C2H4(O.C4H70)2,  boiling  at  240°  ;  the  neutral  isovalerate, 
boiling  at  255°.  Double  salts  are  also  known,  such  as  ethylene  aceto- 
butyrate,  C2H4(O.C2H30)(O.C4H70),  boiling  at  208°-215°,  and  the 
aceto-isovalerate,  C2H4(O.C2H3O)(O.0,^H9O),  boiling  point  about  230°. 
All  the  above  neutral  salts  are  oily  liquids.  Ethylene  distearate, 
C2H4(O.C18H350)2,  is  solid  and  crvstallises  in  plates  which  melt 
at  76°. 

Acetates   of  the  polyethylenic  glycols  (§  506)  are  also  known. 
Of  the  salts  of  higher  members  of  the  series  there  may  be  mentioned — 
Propylene  diacetate,  OH3.CH(O.C2H30).CH2.(O.C2H30),  boils  at 
186°  ;  the  isomeric  trimethene  diacetate  : 

C2H3O.O.CH2.CH2.CH2.O.C2H30, 

boils  at  203°-205°.     Butylene  diacetate  boils  at  200° ;  isoamylene  di- 
acetate, at  above  200°. 

Anhydrides  of  the  Fatty  Acids. 

624.  If  two  oxygenated  acid  radicals  are  combined  together  by 
means  of  an  oxygen  atom,  the  anhydrides  of  monobasic  acids  result  : 

Cn'H2n,+  1.COv>Q 
Cn.<H2ir+1.CO^ 


ANHYDEIDES.  371 

whose  general  molecular  formula  is  CnH2n_203.  Their  preparation 
is  not  effected  directly  from  the  acids,  like  the  ethers  from  the  alcohols, 
but  is  accomplished  readily  by  the  reaction  of  the  acid  haloids  on  an- 
hydrous salt  of  the  acids,  the  sodium  salts  being  generally  taken. 
The  reaction  is  accompanied  by  considerable  evolution  of  heat  and 
separation  of  sodic  chloride.  If  both  the  salt  and  acid  haloid  em- 
ployed contain  the  same  acid  radical,  the  so-called  simple  anhydrides 
are  formed : 

Cn,H2n,+  1.CO.Cl  +  NaO.CO.Cn,H2n,+  1  =  NaCl 
+  Cn,H2n,  +  1.CO.O.CO.Cn,H2n,  +  1, 

whilst  if  derivatives  of  different  acids  be  used,  mixed  anhydrides  are 
obtained  : 

Cn'H2n,+  1.COCl  +  NaO.CO.Cn,H2n~+1  =  NaCl 
+  Cn,H2n,+  1.CO.O.CO.Cn~H2ir  +  v 

If  the  resulting  anhydride  can  be  volatilised  unchanged,  it  is  separated 
from  the  sodic  chloride  by  distillation ;  in  other  cases  the  mixed  pro- 
duct is  extracted  with  ether,  which  dissolves  the  anhydride  only  and 
yields  it  again  on  evaporation. 

In  preparing  the  '  simple '  anhydrides  it  is  not  necessary  to  first 
prepare  the  acid  chloride,  as  the  formation  of  this  can  be  combined 
with  its  action  on  the  salt  into  a  single  operation  by  decomposing  four 
molecules  of  a  salt  with  one  molecule  of  phosphoric  oxy chloride 
(comp.  §  603)  : 

POClg  +  ANaO.CnHjn^O  =  NaOP02  +  3NaCl  +  2(CnH2n_10)20. 

625.  The  acid  anhydrides  are  very  unstable  compounds  in  the 
presence  of  water  or  alcohol.  At  first  they  do  not  mix  with  water, 
but  soon  decompose  with  it  into  free  acid  : 

(OnHan.iOJaO  +  OH2  =  2CnH2n_lO.OH; 

with  alcohols  they  yield  the  free  acid  and  ethereal  salt : 

(CnHjn^OJjO  +  CnH2n  +  1.OH  =  Cn.H2n.+  1.O.CBH21l_10 
+  CnH2n_1O.OH. 

They  are  still  more  readily  decomposed  by  basic  oxides. 

On  heating  with  chlorine  they  yield  acid  chlorides  and  chlor 
substituted  acids : 

CnH2n+1.CO.O.CO.CnH2n+1  +  Cl2  =  CnH2n+1.COCl 
+  CnH2nCl.CO.OH. 

626.  Baric  peroxide  converts  the  anhydrides  into  peroxides  of  the 
acid  radicals,  heat  being  evolved  :

627.  Acetic  anhydride,  diacetyl  oxide,  C4H603  =  (CH3.CO)20,  is 
obtained  when  one  part  of  phosphoric  oxychloride  is  allowed  to  slowly 
drop  on  three  parts  of  finely  powdered  anhydrous  sodic  acetate,  or 
when  equal  weights  of  acetic  chloride  and  sodic  acetate  are  similarly 
mixed.  The  reaction  is  conducted  in  a  tubulated  retort,  and  at  its 
completion  the  acetic  anhydride  distilled. 

It  is  a  colourless,  mobile  liquid,  of  1*073  sp.  gr.  at  20°,  138°  boiling 
point,  and  3  "47  vapour  density.  It  at  first  sinks  in  oily  globules  in 
pure  water,  but  soon  dissolves  with  evolution  of  heat  and  conversion 
into  acetic  acid.  On  heating  with  pOtassic  acetate  it  dissolves  two 
molecules  of  this  salt,  forming  a  crystalline  compound  corresponding 
to  potassic  diacetate  (§  575) :

If  chlorine  gas  be  passed  into  acetic  anhydride  contained  in  a  tubu- 
lated retort,  and  heated  to  100°,  chlor-acetyl  distils,  whilst  monochlor 
acetic  acid  remains  behind. 

628.  When  baric  peroxide  is  added  to  acetic  anhydride  mixed 
with  ether,  heat  is  evolved  and  baric  acetate  separates.  The  ethereal 
solution,  decanted  from  the  latter  and  evaporated,  yields  a  residue  of

great  violence.     It  decolorises  indigo  solution,  liberates  iodine  from 
potassic  iodide,  and  yields,  with  baric  hydrate,  baric  acetate  and  baric 
peroxide : 

(C2H30)202  +  2Ba(OH)2  =  Ba(O.C2H30)2  +  Ba03H2. 

629.  The  other  anhydrides  resemble  acetic  anhydride  so  closely 
that  a  very  short  description  will  suffice. 

Propionic  anhydride,  (CH3.CH2.CO)20,  boils  at  165°. 

Butyric  anhydride,  (CH3.CH2.CH2.CO)20,  boiling  point  about

Isovaleric  anhydride,  ([CH3]2 :  CH.CH2.CO)20,  boils  at  215°. 

Caprylic  anhydride,  (C7H15.CO)20,  solidifies  in  crystals  at  — 18°, 
is  liquid  at  0°,  and  boils  with  partial  decomposition  between  180°  and 
190°. 

Pelargonic  anhydride,  (C8H17.CO)20,  solidifies  at  0°,  melts  at

Myristic  anhydride,  (CnH23.CO)90,  is  a  fatty  mass  which  melts 
at  54°. 


ANHYDKIDES.  373 

630.  Some  compounds  may  be  mentioned  here  which  are  the 
mixed  anhydrides  of  fatty  and  inorganic  acids. 

Aceto-hypochlorous  anhydride,  chlorine  acetate,  CH3.CO.Cl,  formed 
on  strongly  cooling  acetic  anhydride  and  chlorine  monoxide  : 

(C2H30)20  +  C120  =  2C2H3O.O.Cl, 

as  a  colourless  liquid,  not  miscible  with  water,  which  on  heating  to  100° 
explodes  violently,  and  is  decomposed  by  water  into  acetic  and  hypo- 
chlorous  acids.  It  absorbs  ethylene  with  formation  of  ethylene  aceto- 
chloride  :

Aceto-iodous  anhydride,  or  iodine  triacetate,  I(O.CO.CH3)3,  is  ob- 
tained, by  passing  chlorine  monoxide  into  a  solution  of  iodine  in  acetic 
anhydride,  as  colourless  prisms,  which  explode  between  100°  and  140° 
and  deliquesce  in  moist  air.

2P(OH)3  +  2C1C2H30  =  2HC1  +  HO.C2H30  +  P2(C2H30)H305. 

It  yields  dibasic  salts  with  the  metals,  and  in  the  case  of  lead  a  tri- 
basic  salt.  On  oxidation  with  hydric  peroxide  (baric  peroxide  in 
presence  of  hydrochloric  acid)  it  yields  the  tribasic  aceto-pyrophos- 
phoric  acid : 

u<XPO(OH).O.C2H30 

Aceto-ortho-silicic  anhydride,  silicon  tetracetate,  Si(O.C2H30)2,  is 
obtained  on  heating  a  mixture  of  one  molecule  of  silicic  tetrachloride 
and  four  molecules  of  acetic  acid  (with  elimination  of  4HC1),  or  with 
four  molecules  of  acetic  anhydride  (together  with  4C1.C0.CH3).  On 
cooling  the  compound  crystallises  in  white  quadratic  prisms,  melting 
at  110°,  boiling  at  148°  under  a  pressure  of  6  mm.,  but  decomposing 
at  160°- 170°  into  silica  and  acetic  anhydrides  : 

Si(O.CO.CH3)4  =  Si02  +  20(CO.CH3)2. 

Thio- Acids,  their  Salts  and  Anhydrides. 

631.  On  adding  liquid  fatty  acids  to  phosphorus  tri-  or  penta- 
sulphide,  oxides  of  phosphorus  and  thio-acids  are  formed,  with  evolu- 
tion of  heat.     The  thio-acids  can  be  purified  by  distillation  : 

P2S5  +  5HO.CO.CnH2n+1  =  P205  +  5HS.CO.C„Han+1. 

In  similar  manner  the  anhydrides  and  phosphorus  sulphides  yield 
thio-anhydrides — diacidoxyl  sulphides  : 

P2S5  +  50(CO.CnH2n+1)2  =P205  +  5S(CO.CnH2n+1)2. 

Ethereal  thio-salts  are  prepared  from  metallic  mercaptides  and  acid 
chlorides  : 

CnH2n+  1SK  +  Cl.CO.Cn<H2]r+  j  =  KC1  +  CnH2n  +  i.S.CO.Cn/H2n,+  lt 


374  DERIVATIVES   OF  THE  ACID  RADICALS,   CJI^-i- 

or  from  alkyl  haloids  and  metallic  salts  of  thio-acids  : 

C„H2n+1I  +  NaS.CO.Cn-H2n,+  1  =  Nal  +  CnH2n+1.S.CO.Cn,H2n,  +  1. 

The  ethereal  oxy-salts  can  also  be  converted  into  thio- salts  by 
action  of  phosphorus  sulphides,  but  further  decompositions  readily 
ensue. 

Thio-anhydrides  are  slowly  converted  by  water  into  oxy-  and  thio- 
acids  : 
S(CO.CnH2n,+  1)2  +  H20  =  HO.CO.Cn,H2n.  +  1  +  HS.CO.Cn.H2n+1. 

632.  By  action  of  nitric  acid  the  sulphur  of  the  thio  compounds  is 
oxidised,  the  thio-acids  and  anhydrides  yielding  sulphuric  and  fatty 
acids: 

HS.CO.Cn,H2n,+  1  +  40  +  H20  =  H2S04  +  HO.CO.CnH2n.+  1 
S(CO.Cn,H2n,+  1)2  +  40  +  2H20  =*H2S04  +  2HO.CO.Cn.H2n.  +  1. 

The  ethereal  thio-salts  yield  the  respective  alkyl  sulphonic  acids  and 
fatty  acids : 

CnH2n+1.S.CO.CnH2n.+  1  +  30  +  H20  =  CnH2n  +  1.S02.OH 
+  HO.CO.Cn/E2n,+  1. 

633.  Thio  derivatives  of  formic  acid  have  not  yet  been  prepared 
in  the  pure  state.  By  the  decomposition  of  plumbic  formate  by 
hydric  sulphide  there  is  formed — especially  when  the  temperature  is 
high  (200°-300°) — a  crystalline  sulphuretted  product,  which  was 
formerly  taken  for  thio-formic  acid,  but  later  has  been  shown  not  to 
possess  a  definite  composition. 

634.  Acetoxyl  Derivatives. — Thiacetic  acid,  CH3.CO.SH,  is  formed, 
in  addition  to  the  above-mentioned  reactions,  by  the  action  of  acetic 
chloride  on  potassic  sulph-hydrate  ;  it  is  a  colourless  liquid,  soon  turns 
yellow,  and  has  an  odour  resembling  both  acetic  acid  and  hydric 
sulphide.  It  mixes  in  every  proportion  with  alcohol  and  ether,  but 
is  more  difficultly  soluble  in  water.  It  boils  at  93°,  has  at  10°  sp.  gr. 
1*074,  and  does  not  solidify  at  —17°.  Phosphoric  pentachloride 
reacts  on  it  as  on  acetic  acid. 

PCl5  +  HS.CO.CHg  =  PSCI3  +  HC1  +  Cl.CO.CH3. 

Its  salts  are  mostly  crystalline  and  readily  soluble.  Plumbic  thi- 
acetate,  Pb(S.CO.CH3)2,  forms  characteristic  colourless  needles,  which 
after  some  time  blacken,  with  formation  of  plumbic  sulphide  and 
probably  of  sulph  acetic  anhydride. 

Ethylic  thiacetate,  C2H5.S.CO.CH3,  is  an  oil  which  floats  on 
water  and  boils  at  117°. 

Thiacetic  anhydride,  diacetoxyl  sulphide,  is  a  yellowish  oil,  which 
boils  at  121°,  at  first  sinks  in  water,  and  then  slowly  dissolves  to 
acetic  and  thiacetic  acids. 

Diacetoxyl  disulphide,  S2(CO.CH3)2,  is  formed  according  to  the 
general  method  for  obtaining  disulphides  (§  242)  by  decomposing 
alkaline  thiacetates  with  iodine  :

ACIDOXYL  NITROGEN   COMPOUNDS.  375 

635.  Thiobutyric  acid,  CH3.CH2.CH2.CO.SH,  is  a  liquid  of 
nauseous  odour,  boils  at  130°,  and  is  nearly  insoluble  in  water. 

Nitrogen  Compounds  of  the  Acid  Oxyls. 

636.  Formation. — The  acid  oxyls  can  be  substituted  for  the 
hydrogen  of  ammonia  in  similar  manner  to  the  alcohol  radicals, 
whereby  first  amide  (NH2)  compounds,  the  acid  amides,  are  formed. 
They  are  obtained  by  action  of  the  acid  haloids  on  ammonia  : 

CnH2n+1.CO.Cl  +  2NH3  =  CnH2n+1.CO.NH2  +  NH4C1, 

and   can   be   separated   from   the   accompanying  amnionic  salts  by 
solution  in  anhydrous  alcohol  or  ether. 

They  are  prepared  more  conveniently  from  the  ethereal  salts  of 
the  fatty  acids,  which  by  long  standing,  or  more  quickly  by  heating 
with  ammonia  solution,  are  decomposed  into  alcohols  and  acid 
amides  : 

CnH2n  +  1.O.CO.Cn.H2n,+  1  +  NH3  =  CnH2n  +  1.OH 

+  NH2.CO.Cn/H2n,+  l 
CnH2n(O.CO.Cn,H2n.  +  1)2  +  2NH3  =  CnH2n(OH)2 
+  2NH2.CO.CnH2ir+1. 

Those  members  of  the  series  which  can  be  distilled  unchanged  are 
usually  prepared  by  dry  distillation  of  the  amnionic  salts  of  the  acids  : 

CnH2n,+  1.CO.O.NH4  =  H20  +  CnH2n  +1.CO.NH2, 

or,  what  comes  to  the  same  thing,  by  distillation  of  a  dry  mixture  of 
the  sodic  salt  of  the  fatty  acid  with  ammonic  chloride. 

The  anhydrides  are  decomposed  by  ammonia,  yielding  acid  amides 
and  ammonic  salts  : 

0(CO.Cn.H2n.  +  1)2  +  2NH3  =  NH4.O.CO.CnH2n.+  1 
+  NH2.CO.CnH2n  +  1. 

637.  Bi-  and  triacid  oxylamine  compounds  cannot  be  obtained  from 
the  acid  amides  by  a  repetition  of  their  method  of  formation,  these 
bodies  being  only  obtainable  indirectly,  as  by  heating  the  acid  nitriles 
with  the  acids  to  200°  :

638.  If,  instead  of  ammonia,  alkylamines  are  employed  in  the 
method  of  preparing  acid  amides,  there  are  obtained  alkyl  acidoxyl- 
amines;  e.g. 

C  H  O  IT 

N^H     °  +  C2H5.O.CO.CH3  =  C2H6.OH  +  N^CO.CH3 

Ethyl  acetainine.

639.  In  like  manner  to  their  action  on  ammonia,  the  acid  chlorides 
also  react  on  other  ammonia  derivatives  in  which  there  is  still  hy- 
drogen united  to  nitrogen.  The  acid-oxyl  group  can  thus  be  inserted 
in  urea,  sulph-urea,  isocyanides,  &c;  e.g. 

NH2.CO.NH2  +  Cl.CO.Cn,H2n-+1  =  HC1 
+  NH2.CO.NH(CO.Cn,H2n,+  1). 

Acid-oxyl  urea.

640.  Properties. — Whilst  the  alcohol  radicals  can  only  be  sepa- 
rated with  difficulty  from  the  nitrogen  united  to  them,  the  acid  oxyls 
are  readily  disunited  from  their  amide  compounds,  this  occurring  even 
by  heating  with  water,  which  unites  directly  with  the  monamides, 
forming  ammonic  salts  : 

CnH2n,+  1.CO.NH2  +  H20  =  Cn.H2n.+  1.CO.O.NH4; 

more  readily  by  means  of  alkalies  : 

Cn.H2n,+  1.CO.NH2  +  HOK  =  Cn,H2n.+  1CO.OK  +  NH3, 
or  by  acids  in  presence  of  water  : 
CnH2n+1.CO.NH2  +  H20  +  HC1  =  NH4C1  +  Cn,H2n,+  1.CO.OH. 

Nitrous  acid  readily  oxidises  them,  with  liberation  of  nitrogen  : 
C„<H2n,+  1.CO.NH2  +  HO.NO  =  H20  +  N2  +  Cn-H2n  +  1.CO.OH. 

The  formation  of  acid  nitriles  or  alkyl  cyanides  by  heating  the 
acid  amides  with  phosphoric  anhydride  has  been  already  mentioned 
(§  545).

ACIDOXYL  NITKOGEN   COMPOUNDS.  377 

It  is  a  colourless  liquid,  readily  soluble  in  water  and  alcohol,  which 
boils  at  192°-195°,  partially  decomposing  into  carbonic  oxide  and

CHO.NH2  =  CO  +  NH3. 

Phosphoric  anhydride  converts  it  into  prussic  acid  (formo-nitrile)  : 

CHO.NH2  +  P205  =  2HP03  +  CHN. 

Ethyl  form-amide,  N(C2H5)(CHO)H,  is  obtained  by  the  decom- 
position of  ethereal  formates  by  ethylamine,  as  also,  together  with 
chloroform,  by  distillation  of  a  mixture  of  chloral  and  ethylamine. 
It  is  a  liquid  which  boils  at  199°.

Alkalies  convert  it  into  an  alkaline  formate  and  ethylene  diamine,

Acetoxyl  Compounds. 

642.  Acetamide,  C2H5NO  =  CH3.CO.]SrH2,  is  obtained  by  heat- 
ing ethereal  acetates  with  ammonia  to  100°-120°,  by  the  dry  distilla- 
tion of  ammonic  acetate,  and  other  general  methods.  It  forms  long 
colourless  needles,  which  smell  like  the  excrements  of  mice,  melt  at 
78°-79°,  and  distil  at  222°.  It  is  readily  soluble  in  alcohol,  diffi- 
cultly in  ether.  It  yields  weak  compounds  with  acids  which  are  de- 
composed by  water.  On  passing  hydrochloric  acid  into  an  ethereal 
solution  of  acetamide,  lanceolate  crystals  separate  of  the  formula 
2C2H5N0,HC1,  or

which  on  heating  decomposes  partially  into  acetyl  diamine  hydro-

diacetoxylamine : 

(CH3.C0.NH2)2HC1  =  NH4C1  +  (CH3.CO)2NH. 

A  solution  of  acetamide  in  concentrated  nitric  acid  yields,  on 
evaporation  of  the  excess  of  acid,  leafy  crystals  of  acetamide  nitrate  : 

N(CO.OH3)H3.O.N02.

are  obtained. 

Ethyl  acetamide,  N(C2H5)(C2H30)H,  is  obtained  on  decomposing 
ethylic  acetate  with  ethylamine,  and  by  action  of  acetic  acid  on  ethylic 
isocyanate.     It  is  a  syrup  boiling  at  200°.

acid,  at  200°.  It  forms  colourless  crystals,  readily  soluble  in  water, 
melts  at  59°,  and  boils  at  210°-215°. 

Ethyl  diacetamide,  N(C2H5)(CO.CH3)2,  is  formed  on  bringing  to- 
gether ethylic  isocyanate  and  acetic  anhydride  : 

OC=N.C2H5  +  0(CO.CH3)2  =  C02  +  KC2H5.(CO.CH3)2. 

644.  Triacetamide,  or  triacetylamine,  N(CO.CH3)3,  is  formed  by 
heating  a  mixture  of  aceto-nitrile  with  acetic  anhydride  to  200°  : 

N :  C.CH3  +  0(CO.CH3)2  =  N(CO.CH3)3. 

It  forms  small  colourless  crystals,  melting  at  78°-79°. 

645.  Acetyl  urea,  NH2.CO.N(CO.CH3)H.  If  acetic  chloride  is 
poured  over  urea,  the  mass  becomes  heated,  with  evolution  of  hydro- 
chloric acid  and  formation  of  acetyl  urea.  The  same  compound  is 
also  formed,  together  with  acetic  acid,  by  the  action  of  acetic  anhydride 
on  urea. 

Acetyl  urea  crystallises  in  long  needles,  little  soluble  in  cold  water, 
melting  at  112°,  and  decomposing  at  higher  temperatures  in  cyanuric 
acid  and  acetamide,  similarly  to  the  conversion  of  urea  into  cyanuric 
acid  and  ammonia.  Acetyl  urea  does  not  yield  compounds  with 
acids. 

On  heating  carbonic  oxychloride  with  acetamide  to  50°,  diacetyl 
urea  is  formed  : 

COCl2  +  2N(C2H30)H2  =  2HC1  +  CO(N.C2H3O.H)2. 

The  hydrochloric  acid  so  formed  reacts  in  turn  on  the  acetamide,  so 
that  aceto-nitrile,  water,  acetic  acid,  and  amnionic  chloride  are  also 
formed.  Diacetyl  urea  crystallises  in  colourless  needles,  which  are 
difficultly  soluble  in  cold  water  and  can  be  sublimed  without  de- 
composition. 

Acetyl  sulph-urea,  NH2.CS.NH(C2H30),  is  readily  prepared  from 
sulph-urea  by  action  of  acetic  chloride  or  acetic  anhydride.  It  crystal- 
lises in  colourless  prisms,  which  melt  at  165°  and  dissolve  in  large 
quantity  in  water  and  alcohol. 

646.  Acetic  isocyanide,  cyanacetyl,  is  obtained  by  the  action  of 
acetic  chloride  on  argentic  cyanide  : 

CH3.CO.Cl  +  Ag.  N  j  C  =  AgCl  +  CH3.CO.N  j  C. 

It  is  a  liquid  boiling  at  93°,  which  is  decomposed  by  water  into  acetic 
and  hydrocyanic  acids,  and  by  warming  with  aqueous  acids  into  acetic 
and  formic  acids  and  amnionic  salts  : 

CH3.CO.N  j  C  +  3H20  +  HC1  =  CH3.CO.OH

and  on  long  standing,  or  by  contact  with  sodium,  is  converted  into  a 
crystalline  polymeric  compound,  melting  at  69°  and  boiling  at 
208°-209°. 

647.  Propionamide,  CH3.CH2.CO.NH2,  crystallises  in  colourless

Isovaleramide,  (CH3)2  :  CH.CH2.CO.NH2,  crystallises  in  leafy 
crystals. 

Amides  of  acids  richer  in  carbon  have  been  prepared  by  decom- 
position of  the  ethereal  salts  with  ammonia.  Their  melting  points 
are  as  follows:  cenanthamide,  C6H13.CO.NH2,  at  95°;  caprylamide, 
C7H15.CO.NH2,  at  110° ;  palmitamide,  C15H31.CO.KE2,  at  93'5°. 

Mixtures  of  several  amides  are  obtained  by  shaking  the  fats,  the 
glyceric  salts  of  fatty  acids,  with  aqueous  or  alcoholic  ammonia  :

649.  The  radical  C2H3  =  CH2  :  CH.  is  termed  vinyl. 

Vinylic  chloride,  monochlor  ethylene,  CH2  :  CHC1,  is  obtained  from 
ethylenic  dichloride  by  action  of  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  (§  473),  as 
also,  though  with  more  difficulty,  from  ethylidenic  chloride,  as  a 
colourless  gas  of  garlic  odour,  which  on  strong  cooling  is  condensed  to 
a  liquid  boiling  at  — 18°  :

Vinylic  iodide,  moniod-ethylene,  boils  at  55°  and  has  sp.  gr.  1*98 
(§475). 

All  three  vinylic  haloids  are  converted  into  acetylene  when  heated 
with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate. 

The  formation  and  properties  of  the  nitrogen  and  phosphorus 
bases  have  been  already  mentioned  (§  523). 

650.  Ethenyl  trihaloids  are  formed  from  the  vinyHc  haloids  by 
direct  combination  with  halogens. 

Ethenyl  trichloride,  chlor-ethylene  dichloride,  CH2C1.CHC12,  is  a 
colourless  oil  boiling  at  115°,  and  having  sp.  gr.  1*4223  at  0°. 

Ethenyl  tribromide,  bvom-ethylene  dibromide,  CH2Br.CHBr2, 
smells  like  chloroform,  and  does  not  mix  with  water;  it  boils  at 
186-5°  and  has  sp.  gr.  2'62  at  23°. 

Ethenyl  dichloride  ethylate,  CH2C1.CHC1.0.C2H5,  is  the  bichlor 
ether  obtained  by  the  direct  action  of  chlorine  on  ether  (§  207).  To 
prepare  it,  perfectly  pure  ether  is  placed  in  a  flask  cooled  with  ice, 
and  chlorine  passed  into  it.  When  the  liquid,  coloured  green  by 
chlorine,  is  only  slowly  decolorised,  it  is  distilled  from  the  water  bath, 
when  ether  distils  over.  The  brown  residue  is  then  submitted  to 
fractional  distillation,  that  passing  over  between  140°-147°  being 
bichlor  ether,  which  is  purified  by  renewed  fractionation. 

Bichlor  ether  is  a  colourless  liquid,  of  sp.  gr.  1'174  at  23°,  and 
boils  with  slight  decomposition  at  145°.  It  dissolves  slowly  in  water, 
yielding  hydrochloric  acid,  alcohol,  and  apparently  aldehyde-like 
bodies.  For  its  conversion  into  ethyl  chlor-ether  and  secondary  normal 
butylic  alcohol  see  §  169,  2. 

Ethenyl  chloride  diethylate,  CH2C1.CH(0.C2H5)2,  chlor-acetal,  is 
formed,  together  with  further  substitution  products,  by  the  action  of 
chlorine  on  80  %  alcohol : 

CH3.CH2.OH  +  2HO.C2H5  +  2C12  =CH2C1.CH(0C2H5)2 
+  H20  +  3HC1. 
It  is  also  formed  by  slowly  adding  sodium  ethylate  to  bichlor  ether  : 
CH2C1.CHC1(0.C2H5)  +  NaO.C2H5  =  NaCl  +  CH2C1.CH(0C2H5)2, 
and  rectifying  the  oil  separated  by  water.    It  boils  at  157°,  has  sp.  gr. 
about  1*02,  and  is  not  altered  by  potassic  hydrate. 

Ethenyl  bromide  diethylate,  CH2Br.CH(O.C2H5)2,  brom-acetal,  is 
formed  by  dropping  bromine  into  cooled  acetal.  It  is  a  heavy,  colour- 
less oil,  boiling  with  partial  decomposition  at  170°. 

651.  A  very  violent  reaction  occurs  between  bichlor  ether  and 
concentrated  solution  of  potassic  hydrate ;  an  oily  Hquid  separates, 
which  can  be  resolved  into  two  compounds  by  repeated  fractional 
distillation. 

Ethenyl  hydrate  ethylate  chloride,  or  fi-oxychlor  ether  : 

CH2(OH).CHC1.0.C2H5, 
boils  between  151°  and  155°. 


ETHENYL  COMPOUNDS.  381 

Ethenyl  chloride  ethylate  oxide,  [CH2C1.CH(0C2H5)]20,  boils  at 
163°-165°.  This  latter  body  results  from  the  decomposition  of  the 
substance  next  to  be  described. 

Ethenyl  chloride  ethylate  hydrate,  a-oxychlor  ether,  or  mono- 
chlor  aUehxjde  alcoholate,  CH2Cl.CH(OH)(O.C2H5),  is  obtained  by 
the  action  of  water  at  high  temperatures  on  bichlor  ether,  as  a  liquid 
boiling  at  between  95°-96°  : 

CH2C1.CHC1(0.C2H5)  +  HOH  =  HC1  +  CH2Cl.CH(OH)(O.C2H5). 

On  repeated  distillation  it  decomposes  slowly  into  ethenyl  chloride 
ethylate  oxide  and  water.  The  reaction  of  potassic  hydrate  on  bichlor 
ether  is  represented  by  the  equation  : 

aCH2Cl.CHCl(O.C2H5)  +  aKOH  =  aKCl 
+  6CH2(OH),CHCl.(OC2H5)  +  (a-6)CH2Cl.CH(OH)(O.C2H5). 

652.  J/onochlor  aldehyde,  or  ethenyl  chloride  oxide,  is  obtained  by 
gently  heating  chlor-acetal  or  ethenyl  chloride  ethylate  hydrate  with 
concentrated  sulphuric  acid  : 

CH2Cl.CH(OH)(O.C2H5)  +  H2S04  =  C2H5.HS04  +  H20 
+  CH2Cl.CHO ; 

it  is  also  obtained  from  vinylic  chloride  by  oxidation  with  hypo- 
chlorous  acid : 

CHC1 :  CH2  +  HOC1  =  CH2Cl.CHO  +  HC1. 

In  presence  of  water  monochlor  aldehyde  can  be  distilled  below 
100°,  probably  as  ethenyl  chloride  dihydrate,  CHCl.CH(OH)2. 

It  oxidises  in  the  air  and  reduces  argentic  oxide,  being  converted 
into  chloracetic  acid  :

653.  Oxyaldehyde,  or  ethenyl  hydrate  oxide,  CH2(OH).CHO,  has 
not  yet  been  obtained  in  a  state  of  purity,  but  is  formed  in  some 
quantity  when  bichlor  ether  is  heated  with  water,  or  /3-oxychlor  ether 
with  strong  sulphuric  acid  : 

CH2C1.CHC1.0.C2H5  +  2H20  =  CH2(OH).CHO  +  2HC1 

+  HO.C2H5 

CHo(OH).CHCl(O.C2H5)  +  H2S04  =  CH2(OH).CHO  +  HC1 

+  C2H5.HS04. 

On  shaking  the  brown  mass  obtained  in  the  latter  case  with  ether, 
and  evaporating  the  ethereal  solution,  there  is  obtained  a  syrup  of 
persistent  aldehyde-like  odour,  which  oxidises  to  glycollic  acid  on 
exposure  to  air,  or  more  quickly  by  treatment  with  argentic  oxide  :

Monobrom  propylene,  CH3.CBr :  CH2,  boils  at  57°-58°. 

659.  By  the  union  of  these  two  compounds  with  halogens  the 
trihaloids  of  the  radicals  are  obtained  as  liquids  insoluble  in  water. 

Chlor-propylene  dichloride,  CH3.CC12.CH2C1,  boils  at  123°;  it 
is  also  obtained  by  the  action  of  phosphoric  chloride  on  monochlor 
acetone : 

CH3.C0.CH2C1  +  PC15  =  CH3.CC12.CH2C1  -f  POCl3,

It  is  isomeric  with  propenyl  trichloride  (§  665). 

Brom-propylene  dibromide,  CH3.CBr2.CH2Br,  is  an  oil  of  powerful

compound  is  obtained  when  the  vapours  of  propylene  dibromide  and 
bromine  are  brought  together.

660.  Monosubstitution  Products  of  Acetone. — Monochlor  acetone, 
CH3.C0.CH2C1,  is  obtained  by  oxidation  of  monochlor  propylene  by 
an  aqueous  solution  of  hypochlorous  acid  : 

CH3.CCI  :CH2  +  H0C1  =  HC1  +  CH3.C0.CH2C1, 

by  oxidation  of  propylene  hydrate  chloride  (§  496),  and  by  the  action 
of  chlorine  on  acetone.  In  the  latter  case  well-cooled  acetone  is 
saturated  with  chlorine  and  the  monochlor  acetone  separated  by 
fractional  distillation.  It  is  a  colourless  liquid  which  attacks  the 
mucous  membrane  and  tear  glands,  is  insoluble  in  water,  boils  at  119°, 
and  has  sp.  gr.  1*17. 

Acetate  of  acetonalcohol,  CH3.CO.CH2.O.C2H3O,  is  obtained  by 
heating  monochlor  acetone  for  some  time  with  an  alcoholic  solution  of 
potassic  acetate,  as  a  liquid  of  refreshing  odour,  boiling  at  about  175°, 
and  having  sp.  gr.  1*053  at  11°.  It  is  soluble  in  water,  but  soon 
decomposes  therewith. 

661.  Monobrom  butylene,  CH3.CH2.CBr.CH2,  is  formed  from 
butylene  dibromide  by  action  of  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  as  a  colour-

Allyl  compounds  can  all  be  obtained  artificially  from  the  trivalent 
alcohol  glycerine. 

By  treating  glycerine  15  parts  with  10  parts  iodine  and  6  of 
amorphous  phosphorus,  and  heating,  allyl  iodide  is  obtained  and 
may  be  separated  from  the  isopropyl  iodide  formed  at  the  same  time

The  allyl  iodide  can  then,  similarly  to  the  alkyl  iodides,  be  converted 
into  the  salts  of  allyl,  and  these  again  by  saponification  into  allyl 
alcohol. 

By  slowly  heating  a  mixture  of  4  parts  glycerine  with  1  of  crys- 
tallised oxalic  acid,  with  addition  of  a  little  ammonic  chloride,  to 
between  220°  and  230°,  and  then  to  about  260°,  a  mixture  first  passes 
over  of  aqueous  formic  acid  and  allyl  alcohol,  and  above  195°  glycerine 
monoformate  principally  distils,  which  by  repeated  distillation  splits 
up  into  water,  carbonic  oxide,  and  allyl  alcohol : 

C3H5(OH)2O.CHO  =  C02  +  OH2  +  C3H5.OH. 

After  saturating  the  collected  distillates  with  K2C03  the  allyl 
alcohol  separates  on  the  surface,  and  is  further  purified  by  distillation 
first  over  solid  KHO  and  finally  over  BaO. 

The  general  behaviour  of  the  allyl  compounds  is  quite  analogous 
to  that  of  the  alkyl  derivatives.  The  most  important  difference  con- 
sists in  that  the  allyl  compounds,  as  primary  substitution  products  of 
propylene,  enter  into  direct  combination  with  the  halogens  and  hypo- 
chlorous  acid,  &c,  to  form  glycerine  compounds :

CH2:CH.CH2.OH  +  HC1  =  CH2:CH.CH2.C1  +  OH2, 

and  also  from  allyl  iodide  by  the  action  of  HgCl2 : 

2C3H5I  +  HgCl2  =  2C3H5C1  +  Hgl2. 

It  is  a  colourless  liquid,  of  disagreeable  smell,  boiling  at  46°,  in- 
soluble in  water,  and  having  at  0°  the  sp.  gr.  -954. 

Allyl  bromide,  C3H5Br,  resembles  the  chloride ;  it  boils  between 
70°-71°  ;  sp.  gr.  1-461  at  0°.  It  combines  with  HBr  to  trimethene

Allyl  iodide,  CH2:CH.CH2I,  is  an  oily  liquid  of  sp.  gr.  1*789  at 
16°,  smells  strongly  like  leeks,  and  boils  at  101°.  It  is  converted  by 
zinc  and  HC1  into  propylene  (§  658),  by  heating  with  HI  into  pro- 
pylene and  isopropyl  iodide  : 

CH2:CH.CH2I  +  HI  =  I2  +  CH2:CH.CH3 
CH2:CH.CH2I  +  2HI  =  I2  +  CH2.CHI.CH3.

which,  treated  with  HI,  yield  propylene  gas  : 

CH2:CH.CH2.HgI  +  HI  =  CH2:CH.CH3  +  Hgl2. 

665.  Allyl  alcohol,  CH2 :  CH.CH2.OH,  obtained  as  above  described, 
is  a  colourless  and  mobile  liquid  of  a  sharp  smell  and  sp.  gr.  at  0°  of 
•858.  It  boils  between  96°  and  97°,  and  crystallises  to  a  colourless 
mass  at  a  temperature  of  — 50°.  It  combines  directly  with  the  halo- 
gens to  glycerine  monohydro-dihaloids,  e.g. 

CH2C1.CHC1.CH2.0H. 

By  oxidising  agents  it  is  converted  first  into  acrolein  and  then  into 
formic  acid. 

Nascent  hydrogen  does  not  combine  with  it  at  the  ordinary  tem- 
perature, but  by  heating  with  potash  to  100°-105°  formic  acid, 
ethyl  alcohol,  primary  propyl  alcohol,  and  some  products  containing 
less  hydrogen,  which  have  not  been  much  investigated,  are  produced. 
Potassium  and  sodium  dissolve  in  allyl  alcohol  with  disengagement  of 
hydrogen  and  formation  of  bodies  analogous  to  the  alkylates  of  the 
alkalies : 

2CH2:CH.CH2.OH  +  Na2  =  H2  +  2CH2:CH.CH2.ONa. 

666.  Ether-like  compounds  of  allyl  are  obtained  by  the  reaction 
between  metallic  allylates  and  the  halogen  compounds  of  the  alcohol 
radical. 

Allyl  ether,  or  diallyl  oxide,  (CH2  :CH.CH2)20,  is  formed  accord- 
ing to  the  following  equation  : 

C3H5OK  +  C3H5I  =  KI  +  ^h;!>0' 

and  also  by  the  action  of  allyl  iodide  on  the  oxides  of  mercury  or 
silver : 

2C3H5I  +  Ag20  =  (C3H5)20  +  2AgI. 

It  is  a  colourless  liquid,  insoluble  in  water,  boiling  at  82°.  A  small 
quantity  appears  to  occur  naturally  in  oil  of  garlic. 

Allyl-methyl  ether,  CH2:CH.CH2.O.CH3,  from  sodic  methylate

AUyl-ethyl  ether,  CH2:CH.CH2.O.CH2.CH3,  obtained  in  a  similar 
manner,  boils  at  64°. 

667.  The  allyl  salts  are  most  easily  obtained  by  the  reaction 
between  allyl  iodide  and  the  silver  salts  of  the  acids. 

Allyl  acetate,  CH2:CH.CH2.O.CO.CH3,  boils  between  98°  and 
100°.  The  formate  is  found  in  small  quantities,  along  with  formic 
acid  and  allyl  alcohol,  among  the  products  resulting  from  heating 
glycerine  with  oxalic  acid.  It  is  lighter  than  water  and  boils  between 
82°  and  83°.     Both  salts  have  a  very  sharp  smell. 

Allyl  butyrate  boils  at  140°,  isovalerate  about  162°.

phur is  easily  replaced  by  metals,  especially  mercury. 

It  gives  by  oxidation  with  nitric  acid  allyl  sulphonic  acid, 
CH2:CH.OH2.S02.OII,  the  barium  salt  of  which  crystallises  in 
shining  prisms. 

Diallyl  sulphide,  or  thio-allyl  ether : 

CH2 :  CH.CH2.S.CH2.CH :  CH2, 

is  the  principal  constituent  of  the  yellow  ethereal  oil  obtained  by  dis- 
tilling garlic  (Allium  sativum)  with  water,  from  which  it  is  obtained 
by  repeated  fractionation  and  rectification  over  potassium.  It  also 
occurs  in  the  leaves  and  seeds  of  many  Cruciferse  (A  Uiaria  officinalis,  &c. ), 
and  is  obtained  synthetically  by  the  reaction  between  C3H5I  and  K2S 
in  alcoholic  solution. 

In  the  pure  form  it  is  a  colourless  oil,  of  a  powerful  garlic-like 
odour,  boiling  at  140°. 

669.  Nitrogen  Compounds  of  Allyl. — Allyl  yields  with  nitrogen 
compounds  similar  to  those  of  the  alcohol  radicals. 

Allyl  iodide  and  ammonia  react,  forming  the  iodides  of  the  various 
allylamines,  from  which  a  mixture  of  the  free  bases  is  liberated  by 
treatment  with  potassic  hydrate.  The  separation  of  the  individual 
constituents  in  a  state  of  purity  is  attended  with  the  usual  difficulties. 

Allylamine,  CH2:CH.CH2.NH2,  is  most  easily  obtained  in  the 
pure  form  by  reducing  allyl  mustard  oil  with  zinc  and  HC1  in 
alcoholic  solution  : 

CH2:CH.CH2.N:CS  +  2Zn  +  5HC1  =  CH2:CH.CH2.NH2HC1 
+  2ZnCl2  +  CH2S. 

On  distilling  the  product  of  the  reaction  with  OKH,  it  is  obtained  as 
an  ammoniacal  liquid  of  sp.  gr.  -864  and  boiling  point  58°. 

The  principal  product  of  the  reaction  between  allyl  iodide  and 
ammonia  : 

4C3H5I  +  4NH3  =  3NH4I  +  N(C3H5)3I, 

tetrallyl  ammonium  iodide,  is  precipitated  from  its  aqueous  solu- 
tion by  KHO  as  a  syrup,  and  crystallises  in  vacuo  over  H2S04 
after  some  time.  By  treating  its  solution  with  argentic  hydrate 
tetrallyl  ammonium  hydrate,  N(C3H5)4OH,  a  caustic  alkaline  liquid, 
is  obtained,  which  on  heating  decomposes  principally  into  triallylamine, 
]ST(C3H5)3,  a  basic  volatile  oil. 

670.  Allyl  pseudo-cyanate,  or  allyl  carboxylamine : 

CH2:CH.CH2.N:CO, 

is  formed  by  heating  allyl  iodide  and  potassic  pseudo-cyanate  together. 
It  is  a  sharp-smelling  oil,  which  boils  at  82°  and  excites  to  tears. 
By  gently  heating  with  water  it  splits  up  into  C02  and  diallyl  urea, 
or  sinapoline  (comp.  §  280) : 

2C3H5.N:CO  +  OH2  =  C02  +  (C3H5)HKCO.NH(C3H5), 

which  crystallises  in  large  leafy  crystals,  melting  at  100°. 


ALLYL  COMPOUNDS.  389 

It  combines  directly  with  ammonia  to  form  monallyl  urea : 
C3H5.N:CO  +  NH3  =  (C3H5).HN.CO.NH2, 
and  with  ethylamine  to  form  ethyl-allyl  urea : 

(C3H5).HKCO.NH(C2H5), 

which  crystallises  in  fine  prisms. 

671.  Allyl  mustard  oil,  or  allyl pseudo-sulpho-cyanate : 

CH2:CH.CH2.N:C:S 

(comp.  §§  284  and  285).  Black  mustard  seeds  contain  the  potassium 
salt  of  a  glucoside  acid,  myronic  acid,  which,  in  presence  of  water  and 
a  ferment  existing  in  the  seeds  (myrosine),  is  converted  into  sugar, 
hydric  potassic  sulphate,  and  allyl  mustard  oil.  The  very  powerful 
odour  of  mustard  oil  is  indeed  evident  after  slightly  moistening  the 
seeds  with  water.  The  oil  is  obtained  by  distillation  with  water,  and 
purified  by  further  fractional  distillation.  It  possesses  the  sp.  gr. 
1*017  at  10°,  and  boils  between  150°  and  151°  ;  its  vapour  density  is 
3*4.     It  is  insoluble  in  water,  but  mixes  freely  with  alcohol  and  ether. 

The  liquid  raises  blisters  on  the  skin,  and  its  vapour  powerfully 
irritates  the  mucous  membranes. 

Synthetically  it  may  be  obtained  by  the  reaction  between  C3H5I 
and  potassium  sulpho-cyanate  in  alcoholic  solutions  (difference  from 
the  alkyl  mustard  oils). 

Ammonia  forms  with  mustard  oil 

Allyl  thio-urea,  or  thio-sinnamine  : 

S:C:N.CH2.CH:CH2  +  NH3  =  S:C^H2GH:CH2)H 

which  crystallises  in  colourless  rhombic  prisms,  of  bitter  taste,  melting 
at  74°,  and  soluble  in  water,  alcohol,  and  ether.  It  combines  with 
monobasic  acids  to  acid,  easily  decomposable  salts,  and  also  gives  com- 
pounds with  metallic  salts  like  mercuric  chloride  and  silver  nitrate. 

Allyl  pseudo-sulpho-cyanate  combines  with  ethylamine  to  form 
allyl-ethyl  thio-urea,  (C3H6)HN.CS.NH.C2H5,  a  difficultly  crystallis- 
able  syrup. 

672.  By  heating  an  aqueous  solution  of  sulph-allyl  urea  with 
plumbic  oxide  the  sulphur  is  removed  and  allyl  cyanamide  formed 
(see  §  276). 

Allyl  cyanamide  is  obtained  as  a  syrupy  mass  after  separating  the 
lead  from  the  solution  by  SH2  and  evaporating.  It  gradually  changes 
or  metamerises  into  triallyl  melamine  or  sinnamine,  C3N6(C3H5)3H3, 
which  is  soluble  in  water,  alcohol,  and  ether,  has  a  bitter  taste,  and 
reacts  alkaline. 

Allyl  nitryl,  CH2  :CH.CH2.N02,  formed  by  the  double  decom- 
position between  allyl  iodide  and  argentic  nitrite,  is  an  oil  heavier 
than  water  which  boils  at  96°. 

Compounds  of  Glycerine. 

673.  The  glycerine  derivatives  contain  the  same  radical  as  the 
allyl  compounds,  but  with  single  combination  between  the  carbon 
atoms,  so  that  it  acts  towards  other  radicals  or  elements  as  a  trivalent 
group.

Either  the  triatomic  alcohol  glycerine  or  the  compounds  of  allyl 
serve  as  raw  material  from  which  the  glycerine  compounds  may  be 


CH2.OH 

Glycerine,  C3H5(OH)3  =  CH.OH 

CH2.OH 

674.  The  naturally  occurring  fats,  both  from  plants  and  animals, 
are  the  neutral  salts  of  the  triatomic  alcohol  glycerine  with  the 
CnHgn.jO.OH  and  the  CnH2n_3O.OH  series  of  acids  and  a  few 
others.  As  previously  explained  (§  561),  the  fats  are  decomposed  by 
boiling  with  strongly  basic  hydrates  into  the  salts  of  the  particular 
acids  and  glycerine  (saponification). 

If  the  alkalies  are  used  as  saponifying  agents  the  glycerine  can  be 
obtained  pure  only  with  difficulty  : 

CaH^OCnHjjn.jOJa  +  3KHO  =  SKO.CnH^O  +  C3H5(OH)3. 

In  this  case  the  mixture  of  soap  and  glycerine  is  neutralised  with  the 
proper  amount  of  H2S04,  the  fatty  acid  which  separates  removed 
mechanically,  and  the  aqueous  solution  evaporated  as  far  as  possible. 
The  residue  is  a  mixture  of  alkaline  sulphate  and  glycerine ;  the  latter 
is  removed  by  absolute  alcohol,  from  which  it  is  again  obtained  as  a 
syrup  on  distilling  off  the  alcohol.  The  saponification  is  much  more 
conveniently  made  with  plumbic  oxide  and  water,  whereby  an  insoluble 
lead  salt  is  formed,  from  which  the  glycerine  solution  is  filtered  and  a 
little  dissolved  lead  removed  by  means  of  SH2.  On  the  manufactur- 
ing scale  glycerine  is  obtained  by  distillation  of  fats  with  superheated 
steam,  producing  insoluble  fatty  acid  and  pure  glycerine.  Glycerine 
can  be  obtained  in  several  ways  from  allyl  compounds,  most  con- 
veniently by  combining  allyl  bromide  with  bromine  to  form  the  tribro- 
mide,  converting  this  by  heating  with  silver  acetate  into  glyceryl  tria- 
cetate, which  can  be  easily  saponified  into  acetic  salts  and  glycerine  : 

C3H5Br3  +  3AgOC2H30  =  3AgBr  +  C3H5(OC2H30)3. 

From  propylene,  and  therefore  from  acetone  and  isopropyl  alcohol, 
glycerine  can  be  obtained  by  means  of  propylene  dichloride. 

The  latter  is  converted,  by  heating  with  iodine  chloride  to  140°, 
into  glycerine  trichloride  (§  655),  which  further,  by  heating  with  much 
water  to  170°,  is  converted  into  glycerine : 

C3H5C13  +  3HOH  +  xOH2  =  C3H5(OH)3  +  3HC1  +  xOK2. 

Small  quantities  of  glycerine  are  also  formed  during  the  alcoholic  fer- 
mentation of  sugar.  Consequently  it  is  found  in  small  quantities  in 
such  alcoholic  beverages  as  are  not  distilled. 

675.  Glycerine  in  the  ordinary  condition  is  a  syrupy  liquid  of 
very  sweet  taste ;  it  can,  however,  by  means  of  cold  and  simultaneous 
shaking,  be  obtained  in  fine  crystalline  masses. 

It  is  soluble  in  water  and  alcohol,  but  scarcelv  in  ether.  By 
heating  in  open  vessels  to  170°  it  is  rendered  anhydrous,  and  then 
possesses  the  sp.  gr.  1*27.  It  absorbs  moisture  from  the  atmosphere. 
Under  ordinary  pressure  glycerine  boils  at  280°,  with  partial  decom- 


OLYCEKINE.  391 

position ;  in  a  vacuum  of  50  mm.  the  boiling  point  is  210°,  at  12  mm. 
179 "5°.     It  is  easily  carried  over  with  steam. 

When  distilled  with  dehydrating  substances,  such  as  P205  or 
potassic  hydric  sulphate,  acrolein  is  formed : 

C3H5(OH)3  =  20H2  +  C3H40; 

with  melted  potash,  acetate,  formate,  and  free  hydrogen  are  yielded  : 

C3H5(OH)3  +  2KOH  =  KO.CHO  +  KO.C2H30  +  OH2  +  2H2. 

Phosphorus  iodide  and  HI  convert  it,  according  to  the  proportion  used, 
into  allyl  iodide,  propylene,  or  isopropyl  iodide  (§  192). 

A  weak  aqueous  solution  of  glycerine  is  slowly  fermented  by  con- 
tact with  yeast  at  20°  to  30°,  propionic  acid  being  formed  : 

CH2(OH).CH(OH).CH2.OH=  CH3.CH2.CO.OH  +  OH2. 

676.  Metallic  Compounds. — Glycerine  dissolves  metallic  oxides  in 
certain  proportions,  and  not  alone  the  alkali  metals,  but  also  calcium, 
barium,  lead,  and  copper  oxides,  undoubtedly  forming  metallic  deriva- 
tives of  glycerine.     The  copper  compound  may  be 

03H5(OII)2.O.Cu.O.C3H5(OH)2  0), 

from  whose  solutions  alkalies  do  not  precipitate  the  copper. 

Many  salts  are  also  very  largely  dissolved  by  glycerine — e.g.  sodic 
chloride,  and  also  arsenious  anhydride. 

Sodium  does  not  act  on  dry  glycerine  at  ordinary  temperatures ; 
on  warming,  however,  the  reaction  is  so  violent  that  the  sodium 
becomes  nearly  red  hot,  and  the  glycerine  is  carbonised  with  produc- 
tion of  acrolein.  On  warming  with  sodium  amalgam  the  reaction 
takes  place  quietlv,  a  crystalline  compound  being  obtained  after  the 
addition  of  alcohol  of  the  form  C3H5(ONa)(OH).2,C2H5OH.  The  same 
body  is,  however,  much  more  easily  formed  by  adding  glycerine  to  a 
solution  of  sodium  ethylate  in  absolute  alcohol.  The  sodium  com- 
pound crystallises  out  almost  immediately,  and  may  be  freed  from  the 
alcohol  molecule  by  heating  to  100°  in  a  stream  of  hydrogen. 

Sodic  glycerate  is  a  white,  very  hygroscopic  substance,  easily 
decomposed  by  water  into  glycerine  and  sodic  hydrate. 

Haloid  Derivatives  of  Glycerine. 

677.  The  three  hydroxyl  groups  in  glycerine  can  be  individually 
replaced  by  halogens. 

By  treatment  of  glycerine  with  the  halogen  acids,  one  or  two  of 
the  hydroxyls  can  be  replaced  according  to  the  relative  proportions 
operated  upon — temperature,  presence  of  water-,  &c.  The  mono-  and 
dihaloid  compounds  are  generally  simultaneously  formed,  but  the 
reaction  can  never  be  carried  out  quantitatively  :

392  DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  TRIVALENT  ALCOHOL  RADICALS,  CnE^^. 

To  remove  the  last  OH  group  recourse  must  be  had  to  the  penta- 
haloid  phosphorus  compounds  : 

c3h5<|h  +  pci5  =  poci3  +  hoi  +  c3H5^cj  <$*»; 

Haloid  glycerines  can  be  formed  from  the  allyl  series  by  addition  of 
halogens,  hypochlorous  acid,  and  haloid  acids,  as  described  in  another 
place. 

By  heating  the  glycerine  haloids  or  haloid  hydrates  with  metallic 
acetates  the  halogen  atoms  are  replaced  by  O.C2H30,  yielding 
glycerine  acetates,  from  which,  on  saponification,  glycerine  is  obtained. 

678.  Monochlorhy drin,  C3H5,(0H)2C1,  doubtless  exists  in  two 
isomeric  forms,  namely : 

CH2.C1  CH2.OH 


A 


H.OH  and  CH.C1 

CH2.OH  CH2.OH 

which,  however,  are  not  yet  known  in  the  pure  state.  It  is  very 
probable  that  a  mixture  of  the  two  bodies  is  formed  when  glycerine 
saturated  with  HC1  is  heated  for  a  long  time  at  100°,  and  afterwards 
fractionally  distilled. 

Allyl  alcohol  combines  with  hypochlorous  acid  with  evolution  of 
heat,  and  the  chlorhydrin  is  left,  after  evaporating  the  liquid  on  the 
water  bath,  as  a  thick  sweet  and  sharp-tasting  liquid,  of  sp.  gr.  1*4  at 
13°  and  boiling  between  230°  and  235°. 

From  its  high  boiling  "point  it  is  probably  the  double  primary 
hydrate  CH2(OH).CHCl.CH2(OH). 

The  preparation  from  glycerine  certainly  contains  the  primary- 
secondary  hydrate  in  greater  proportion,  since  its  aqueous  solution  is 
reduced  by  sodium  amalgam  principally  to  propylene  glycol  (§  488)  :

forms. 

a.  The  primary  hydrate  is  obtained  pure  by  passing  chlorine  into 
anhydrous  allyl  alcohol  cooled  by  ice  :

as  a  mobile,  colourless  liquid,  soluble  in  much  water,  of  sp.  gr.  1*3799 
at  0°  and  182°  boiling  point. 

On  account  of  its  method  of  formation  it  is  called  allyl-alcohol 
dichloride,  and  can  also  be  considered  as  dichlor-propyl  alcohol.     The 


GLYCERYL  HALOIDS.  393 

same  compound  is  formed  directly  from  allyl  chloride  and  hypochlorous 
acid : 

CH2  CH2.OH

CH        +  C1.0H  =  CHC1

CH2C1  CH2C1 

Sodium  takes  away  the  two  chlorine  atoms,  reforming  allyl  alcohol, 
which  by  excess  of  sodium  passes  into  the  allylate. 

/3.  The  secondary  hydrate,  CH2C1,CH(0H),CH2C1,  commonly 
and  improperly  called  dichlorhydrin,  properly  dichlor-isopropyl  alco- 
hol, is  obtained  in  the  pure  state  by  mixing  epichlorhydrin  with  HC1. 
The  combination  takes  place  with  evolution  of  heat : 

CH2.  CH2.C1 

I      >  I 

CH  /     +  HC1  =  CH.OH 

CH2C1  CH2C1 

The  /3-dichlorhydrin  is  a  mobile  liquid  of  agreeable  smell,  boiling  at 
174°,  therefore  8°  lower  than  a,  and  of  sp.  gr.  1-383  at  19°.  It  mixes 
with  alcohol  and  ether,  and  dissolves  in  nine  times  its  volume  of 
water. 

Sodium  amalgam  converts  it  into  isopropyl  alcohol : 

CH2C1.CH(0H).CH2C1  -f-  2Na2  +  20H2  =  2NaCl  f  2NaOH 
+  CH3.CH(OH).CH3. 

It  yields,  by  oxidation  with  dilute  chromic  and  sulphuric  acids,  a 
dichlor  acetone  of  the  form  CH2C1.C0.CH2C1. 

The  two  isomers  are  formed  together  by  long-continued  heating  of 
one  volume  of  glycerine  and  twelve  volumes  of  fuming  HC1  to  100°, 
and  fractionation  of  the  product;  more  conveniently  by  saturating 
a  mixture  of  glacial  acetic  acid  and  glycerine  with  HC1  at  100°.  The 
dichlorhydrin,  boiling  at  174°,  generally  predominates;  and  when  the 
temperature  at  which  the  mixture  is  saturated  with  HC1  exceeds  100° 
it  is  the  sole  product.  By  this  last  method  some  acetate  chloride  is 
also  formed. 

An  excellent  yield  of  dichlorhydrin  is  obtained  by  gradually 
adding  one  molecule  of  glycerine  to  two  of  sulphur  chloride,  with  con- 
tinuous shaking  and  warming  on  the  water  bath,  until  the  sulphur 
has  separated  in  a  compact  state.  It  may  then  be  purified  by  distil- 
lation : 

C3H5(OH)3  +  2S2C12  =  2HC1  +  S02  +  3S  +  C3H5(0H)C12. 

Both  the  a-  and  /3-chlorhydrins  are  converted  by  concentrated  alkalies 
into  epichlorhydrin. 

680.  TricMorhydrin,  or  glyceryl  trichloride,  CH2C1.CHC1.CH2C1, 
isomeric  with  propylene  trichloride  (§  655)  and  chlor-propylene 
dichloride  (§  659),  is  obtained  by  the  action  of  PC15  on  the  two 
previous  compounds.  It  is  separated  from  the  simultaneously  formed 
POCl3  by  washing  with  water  and  distillation. 


394  DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  TRIVALENT  ALCOHOL  RADICALS,  dH^. 

It  is  a  colourless,  mobile  liquid,  with  an  odour  similar  to  that  of 
chloroform,  boiling  at  158°  and  of  sp.  gr.  1*417  at  15°. 

Trichlorhydrin  is  also  produced  by  the  direct  addition  of  chlorine 
to  allyl  chloride,  CH2 :  CH.CH2C1  +  Cl2  =  CH2C1.CHC1.CH2C1,  and, 
along  with  the  isomeric  propylene  trichloride,  by  heating  propylene 
dichloridewith  iodine  chloride. 

Solid  caustic  alkalies  convert  it  into  dichlor  glycid  : 

C3H5C13  +  KOH  =  KC1  +  H20  +  C3H4C12. 

681.  The  bromides  of  glycerine  correspond  in  properties  and 
methods  of  formation  to  the  chlorides,  differing  mostly  from  the  latter 
by  their  greater  density  and  higher  boiling  point.

CH2Br.CH(OH)CH2Br, 

from  glycerine  and  HBr,  boils  at  219°  and  has  the  sp.  gr.  2*11  at

Tribromhydrin,  CH2Br.CHBr.CH2Br,  isomeric  with  brom-propy- 
lene  dibromide,  is  obtained  from  the  previous  compounds  by  means 
of  phosphorus  bromide,  and  also  from  allyl  bromide  or  iodide  and 
bromine  : 

CH2 :  CH.CH2I  +  2Br2  =  CH2Br.CHBr.CH2Br  +  IBr. 

It  crystallises  in  colourless  shining  prisms,  melting  at  16°  and  boiling 
between  219°  and  220°. 

682.  Chlor-brom-hydrin,  C3H5.Cl.Br.OH,  is  formed  by  the  action

may  be  regarded  as  glyceryl  chloride-dibromide ;  it  boils  at  195°  and 
has  the  sp.  gr.  2-088. 

The   isomeric  chlor-dibrom-hydrin,   CH2Br.CHCl.CH2Br,  which 


GLYCERYL  HALOIDS.  395 

boils  between  202°  and  203°,  is  a  product  of  the  action  of  PC15  on 
dibromhydrin. 

Both  compounds  are  isomeric  with  chlor-propylene  dibromide. 

Brom-dichlor-liydrin  is  obtained  quite  in  an  analogous  manner 
from  dichlorhydrin  and  PBr5.  It  boils  at  176°  and  has  the  formula 
CH2Cl.CHBr.CH2CL 

683.  A  moniodo-hydrin,  C3H5I(OH)2,  is  obtained  by  heating 
glycerine  saturated  with  HI  to  100°  for  forty  hours,  and  after  neutralis- 
ing the  free  acid  with  alkali  shaking  out  with  ether.  The  latter 
leaves  on  evaporation  iod-hydrine,  a  yellow  syrup  slightly  soluble  in 
water,  of  sp.  gr.  1*783,  which  decomposes  on  distillation. 

Diiodo-hydrin,  CH2I.CH(OH).OH2L  The  product  of  long-con- 
tinued beating  of  dichlorhydrin  with  a  concentrated  solution  of 
potassic  iodide  is  a  thick  oil  of  sp.  gr.  2*4.  It  crystallises  at  — 16°  to 
colourless  crystals,  and  decomposes  on  heating  with  formation  of  allyl 
alcohol,  allyl  iodide,  and  acrolein,  and  evolution  of  iodine. 

Chlor-iodhy drin,  CH2C1.CH(0H)CH2I,  prepared  by  direct  com- 
bination of  epichlorhydrin  and  HI,  boils  at  226°  under  partial 
decomposition;  sp.  gr.  2*06  at  10°. 

The  corresponding  bromine  compound,  (CH2Br.CH(OH).CH2I), 
is  not  capable  of  being  distilled. 

Triiodo-hf/drin,  or  glycerine  triiodide,  is  not  capable  of  existing, 
decomposing  at  once  into  iodine  and  allyl  iodide.  Several  trihaloid 
glycerine  compounds  are  known,  however — viz.  iodhydrin  and  PC15 
give  CH2C1.CHC1.CH2I,  boiling  at  205°,  sp.  gr.  2-0476  at  9° j  and 
CH2Cl.CHBr.CH2Cl,  from  chloriod-hydrins  and  PBr5,  decomposed 
by  distillation,  sp.  gr.  2*325  at  9°. 

Ethereal  Derivatives  of  Glycerine. 

684.  These  bodies  are  easily  obtained  by  the  reaction  between 
haloid  glycerine  and  the  sodium  alcoholates  (e.g.  sodic  ethylate). 

Monochlorhydrin  yields  in  this  manner  with  sodium  ethylate 
ethyl  hydrin,  or  ethylin,  a  liquid  boiling  at  230°  and  soluble  in  water  : 

C3H5(0H)2C1  +  NaO.C2H5  =  NaCl  +  C3H5(OH)2(O.C2H5)  j 

dichlorhydrin  yielding  a  diethijlin,  CH2(OC2H5)CHOH.CH2.002H5, 
boiling  at  182°-183°,  possessing  a  faint  odour  of  pepper,  sp.  gr.  '92. 

This  compound  dissolves  sodium  and  reacts  again  with  ethyl  iodide, 
forming  triethylin  : 

C3H5(O.C2H5)2.ONa  +  C2H5I  =  Nal  +  C3H5(O.C2H5)3. 

It  is  insoluble  in  water  and  boils  at  185°. 

685.  A  glycerine  chloride  hydrate  ethylate,  or  ethyl  chlor-hydrin,  is 
formed  when  (§  666)  allyl-ethyl  ether  comes  in  contact  with  diluted 
hypochlorous  acid  : 

CH2 :  CH.CH2.O.C2H5  +  ClOH  =  CH2(OH).CHCl.CH2.O.C2H5. 
It  may  be  extracted  from  its  aqueous  solution  by  ether,  and  remains  on 
evaporation  of  that  solvent  as  a  thick  liquid  of  faintly  ethereal  odour, 
boiling  between  183°  and  185°,  of  sp.  gr.  1*117  at  11°. 

By  the  combination  of  cooled  allyl-ethyl  ether  with  chlorine,  a 
glycerine  dichlor ethylate,  CH2C1.CHC1.CH2.0.C2H5,  boiling  at  165°, 
is  formed.     The  corresponding  bromine  compound  also  exists,  boiling

at  195°.  Metallic  sodium  extracts  the  halogen  from  both  bodies, 
reforming  the  allyl-ethyl  ether. 

Allylin,  C3H5(OH)2O.CH2.CH :  CH2,  or  glyceryl  dihydrate  aUyl 
ether,  can  be  isolated  from  the  following  compound  by  fractional 
distillation  of  the  residue  remaining  in  the  retorts  after  the  prepara- 
tion of  allyl  alcohol  from  glycerine  by  heating  with  oxalic  acid.  It  is 
a  thick  liquid  boiling  between  225°  and  240°,  and  combines  directly 
with  bromine  to  form  C3H5(OH)2.O.C3H5Br2. 

Glyceryl  ether,  (C3H5)203,  obtained  along  with  the  above,  is  a 
colourless,  odourless  liquid,  soluble  in  water,  and  boiling  between 
169°  and  172°.  It  has  not  yet  been  determined  which  of  the  two  fol- 
lowing formulae  represents  its  constitution  :

isomeric  with  monochlor  acetone  (§  660),  is  easily  formed  from  the 
glyceryl  dichlorides.  Dichlorhydrin,  boiling  between  160°  and  200°, 
may  be  conveniently  used  for  its  preparation.  On  mixing  gradually 
with  concentrated  potash  and  shaking,  the  reaction  takes  place  with 
considerable  evolution  of  heat,  necessitating  cooling;  the  epichlor- 
hydrin  separates  to  the  surface  as  an  oily  layer,  and  is  purified  by 
fractional  distillation.  It  is  a  limpid  liquid,  of  sp.  gr.  1*194  at  11°, 
and  boils  between  118°  and  119°  ;  it  resembles  chloroform  in  taste  and 
smell. 

Alcohol  and  ether  dissolve  it  in  all  proportions.  By  long  warming 
with  water,  in  which  it  is  insoluble,  it  combines  with  it  to  form 
monochlorhydrin.

Epibromhydrin,  CH2.CH.CH2Br,  isomeric  with  monobrom 
acetone,  is  very  similar  to  the  chlorine  compound  ;  it  boils  between 
130°  and  140°. 

Epiiodo-hydrin,  C3H5I  :  O,  obtained  by  heating  epichlorhydrin 
with  potassic  iodide,  boils  at  about  160°.

C3H5.Cl(OH).OC2H5  +  OKH  =  KC1  +  OH2  +  C3H5( :  0).OC2H5, 

is  a  pleasantly  smelling  liquid,  boiling  between  126°  and  130°. 

Epichlorhydrin  heated  to  220°  with  isoamylic  alcohol  forms 
isoamylchlor-hydrin,  C3H5.Cl.(OH).(O.C3Hn),  boiling  at  235°  and 
decomposing  on  distillation  with  concentrated  alkali  into  glyceryl 
oxide  isoamyl  ether,  CHa.CH.CH^O.CsHu,  a  mobile  liquid  of  exceed-

ingly  pleasant  odour,  boiling  at  188°. 

687.  Derivatives  of  glycerine  are  known,  but  not  in  the  pure 
state,  owing  to  difficulty  of  separation,  bearing  the  same  relation  to  gly- 
cerine that  the  poly-ethylene  alcohols  bear  to  ethylene  glycol  (§  506). 

They  are  generally  formed  by  the  abstraction  of  water  from  gly- 
cerine at  a  temperature  of  incipient  decomposition. 

When  glycerine  is  saturated  with  HC1  and  heated  with  an  equal 
volume  of  glycerine  to  130°,  a  liquid  is  obtained  distilling  in  a  vacuum 
of  10  mm.  between  220°  and  230°,  thus: 

C3H5(OH)3  +  C3H5C1(0H)2  =  HC1  +  C3H5(OH)2.O.C3H5(OH)2, 

diglyceryl  alcohol;  and  between  275°  and  280°  triglyceryl  alcohol  :

ing nitric  acid  and  oil  of  vitriol  with  very  considerable  evolution  of 
heat,  the  operation  requiring  to  be  gradually  performed  with  strong 
cooling.     On  pouring  the  mixture  into  a  large  volume  of  water  a

heavy,  colourless,  poisonous  oil,  glyceric  trinitrate,  nitro-glycerine, 
C3H5(O.N02)3,  is  precipitated.  It  crystallises  at  —  20°  and  has  sp. 
gr.  1  *6.  In  alcohol  it  is  scarcely  soluble,  but  easily  in  ether.  Alcoholic 
potash  saponifies  it  very  easily  into  glycerine  and  potassic  nitrate. 

By  percussion  or  quick  heating  nitro-glycerine  explodes  with 
fearful  violence,  complete  combustion  taking  place,  excess  of  oxygen 
being  present,  thus : 

4C3H5(O.N02)3  =  12C02  +  10H2O  +  6N2  +  02. 

When  merely  inflamed,  however,  nitro-glycerine  burns  rapidly,  but 
without  explosion.  It  is  much  used  as  a  blasting  material  either  in 
the  liquid  form  or  mixed  with  silica  or  fine  sand,  generally  then  called 
dynamite.  For  purposes  of  transport  it  is  often  diluted  with  methyl 
alcohol. 

Dichlorhydrin  is  converted  by  a  mixture  of  nitric  and  sulphuric 
acids  into  glyceryl  dichlor-nitrate,  CH2C1.CH(0.N02)CH2C1,  an  oil 
boiling  with  decomposition  between  180°  and  190°,  but  not  exploding; 
it  has  a  sp.  gr.  at  10°  of  1*465. 

In  a  similar  manner  chlorbromhydrin  gives 

CH2Cl.CH(O.N02)CH2Br  ; 

epichlorhydrin,  CH2Cl.CH(0.]Sr02).CH2.0.]Sr02.  Both  are  thick 
liquids  not  distillable  without  decomposition.  The  latter  is  of  sp.  gr. 
1-5112  at  9°. 

690.  Glycerine  combines  with  sulphuric  acid,  when  mixed  with  it, 
with  evolution  of  a  considerable  amount  of  heat.  On  diluting  with 
water  and  neutralising  with  chalk  a  mixture  of  calcic  sulphate  and 
the  calcium  salt  of  sulpho-gly eerie  acid  is  obtained  ;  the  latter  may  be 
separated  from  the  gypsum  by  its  much  greater  solubility  in  water. 

The  free  acid  may  be  obtained  by  exactly  precipitating  the  calcium 
from  a  solution  of  the  above  salt  with  oxalic  acid. 
Glycerine  sulphuric  acid,  or  sulpho-gly  eerie  acid  : 

C3H5(OH)2(O.S02.OH), 

is  an  acid  and  also  a  basic  ether,  and  corresponds  to  monethyl  sulphate 
or  ethylene  hydrate  sulphate. 

Its  aqueous  solution  reacts  strongly  acid,  and  gives  salts  with 
oxides,  and  carbonates  of  basic  metals  mostly  crystalline  and  without 
exception  soluble  in  water. 

Monochlorhydrin  similarly  forms  a  chlorhydrin  sulphuric  acid, 
C3H5Cl(OH).O.S02.OH. 

691.  Powdered  metaphosphoric  acid  mixed  with  glycerine  also 
combines  with  it,  forming  glycerine  phosphoric  acid  :

with  evolution  of  heat.

GLYCERINE  SALTS.  399 

This  salt,  when  decomposed  by  the  exact  quantity  of  sulphuric  acid, 
yields  the  free  acid,  which  on  evaporation  of  its  aqueous  solution  may 
be  obtained  in  the  form  of  an  acid,  thick  syrup.  Its  salts  are  mostly 
soluble  in  water  and  crystallisable. 

Its  calcium  salt  is  thrown  down  in  pearly  scales  on  boiling  its  cold 
saturated  solution. 

Glycerine  phosphoric  acid  occurs  as  one  of  the  decomposition 
products  of  lecithin  (§  697),  and  is  physiologically  important  from 
its  supposed  existence  in  brain  substance,  &c. 

Salts  of  Glycerine  with  Organic  A  cids.     Fats. 

692.  Glycerine  combines  with  the  acids  of  the  CnH2n  _  jO.OH  series 
when  heated,  water  being  eliminated.  The  number  of  hydroxyl 
groups  replaced  depends  greatly  on  the  temperature  of  the  reaction 
and  the  quantity  of  acid  present. 

The  neutral  salts  of  the  form  C3H5(O.CnH2n_10)3  occur  in  most 
natural  fats,  and  are  in  fact,  in  many,  the  principal  substance.  Most 
solid  animal  fats,  tallow,  &c,  are  composed  of  glycerine  fats  of 
palmitic  and  stearic  acids.  As  yet  no  known  fat  consists  entirely  of 
the  salt  of  one  acid  ;  they  are  generally  mixtures  of  several,  not  only 
of  the  above-mentioned  series,  but  also  with  salts  of  acids  of  the  oleic 
series,  C3H5(O.CnH2n_30)3.  These  latter  salts  confer  liquidity 
(animal  oils)  or  buttery  consistency  on  many  fats,  according  to  the 
extent  of  their  admixture. 

Fatty  or  animal  oils  also  frequently  contain  acids  of  still  lower 
hydrogen  contents,  which  oxidise  easily  on  exposure  to  air,  becoming 
hard  and  resinified,  the  same  property  being  imparted  in  some  degree 
to  their  glycerine  salts,  which  are  hence  termed  drying  oils. 

The  existence  of  glycerine  salts  of  mixed  acids  has  no  doubt  a 
great  influence  in  causing  the  variety  of  animal  fats.  It  appears,  for 
instance,  that  mutton  fat,  or  sheep  tallow,  contains  a  glycerine  di- 
stearin  palmitate,  C3H5(O.C1 81X3.50)2.(0.0! 6H310). 

To  extract  fats  from  organic  tissues  or  substance  mechanical  pres- 
sure, sometimes  with  elevation  of  temperature,  is  generally  resorted  to, 
whereby  the  cells  containing  the  fats  are  broken.  In  cases  where  it 
is  desired  to  extract  the  whole  amount  completely,  solvents,  like  ether 
or  disulphide  of  carbon,  are  used.  From  these  the  fat  may  be  obtained 
by  evaporation  of  the  solvent. 

Natural  fats  may  be  purified  from  the  albuminous  substances  which 
generally  accompany  them,  when  mechanically  extracted,  by  gently 
warming  with  a  little  potash  solution  or  sulphuric  acid,  by  which  the 
albuminoids  are  decomposed  or  dissolved.  Care  must  be  taken  that 
the  temperature  employed  be  not  too  high,  or  the  glycerine  salts  or 
fats  will  themselves  be  saponified  or  converted  by  the  sulphuric  acid 
into  free  fatty  acid  and  sulpho-glyceric  acid. 

The  decomposition  of  fats  by  water  or  steam  at  a  high  temperature, 
as  well  as  their  decomposition  by  ammonia  into  glycerine  and  acid 
amides,  has  already  been  considered. 

The  fats,  when  heated  by  themselves,  undergo  dry  distillation, 
acrolein  being  one  of  the  constant  products,  depending  on  the  presence 
of  glycerine  in  the  fat. 

693.  Only  one  formic  ether  of  glycerine  is  known — glyceryl  di-

hydrate,  formate,  or  monoformin,  C3H5.(OH)2(O.CHO).  It  is  formed 
by  heating  glycerine  with  oxalic  acid  to  190°,  and  may  be  extracted 
from  the  cooled  product  of  the  reaction  by  ether,  on  the  evaporation 
of  which  it  remains  as  a  colourless  liquid,  miscible  with  water  and 
distilling  unchanged  in  a  vacuum.  On  heating  to  200°  it  decomposes 
into  C02,  water,  and  allyl  alcohol  (§  663). 

694.  Acetic  Acid  Derivatives. — Glycerine  heated  with  glacial 
acetic  acid  for  some  time  to  a  temperature  of  100°  yields  a  mixed 
product,  from  which  ether  extracts 

Monacetin,  or  glyceryl  dihydrate  acetate,  formed  according  to  the 
equation : 

C3H5(OH)3  +  HO.C2H30=  OH2  +  C3H5(OH)2(O.C2H30). 

It  is  a  colourless  liquid,  miscible  with  a  small  quantity  of  water,  but 
is  decomposed  by  a  large  quantity. 

Diacetin,  C3H5.(OH).(O.C2H30)2,  is  formed  by  heating  glycerine 
with  a  large  excess  of  acetic  acid  to  200°.  It  may  also  be  extracted 
from  the  cooled  reaction  product  by  ether.  It  is  a  liquid,  and  boils 
at  280°. 

Triacetin,  glyceryl  triacetate,  C3H5(O.C2H30)3,  obtained  by  long 
heating  of  diacetin  with  glacial  acetic  to  about  250°,  is  a  neutral  oil 
of  sp.  gr.  1-174,  boiling  at  268°.  It  occurs  naturally  in  small  amount 
in  the  oil  from  the  spindle  tree  (Evonymus  europaeus). 

695.  In  addition  to  the  acetic  ethers  just  mentioned,  haloid 
acetates  are  also  known. 

Aceto-chlorhydrin,  C3H5Cl(OH)(O.C2H30),  prepared  by  the  action 
of  acetylic  chloride  on  glycerine  : 

C3H5(OH)3  +  Cl.CO.OH3  =  H20  +  C3H5.C1.(0H)C202H3, 

as  a  liquid  of  boiling  point  250°. 

Aceto-dichlorhydrin,  C3H5.C12.(0.C2H30),  is  formed,  together  with 
dichlorhydrin,  by  passing  hydrochloric  acid  gas  into  a  mixture  of 
glycerine  and  glacial  acetic  acid  heated  to  100° ;  also  from  dichlor- 
hydrin and  acetyl  chloride.  There  appears  to  be  two  isomers  of  this 
body,  the  one  prepared  in  the  former  manner  having  a  boiling  point 
205°,  the  latter,  which  is  possibly  CH2C1.CH(0.C2H30)CH201, 
boiling  at  194°-195°,  and  having  sp.  gr.  1*274  at  8°. 

Both  compounds  give  epichlorhydrin  on  saponification  with 
potash  : 

C3H5.C12(0.C2H30)  +  2KOH  =  KC1  +  KO.C2H30  +  OH2 
+  C3H5(:0).C1. 

Diaceto-chlorhydrin,  C3H5C1(0C2H30)2,  is  best  prepared  by  heat- 
ing glycerine  with  acetic  acid  and  acetyl  chloride  simultaneously.  It 
boils  about  245°. 

Several  corresponding  bromine  compounds  are  also  known. 

696.  Analogous  bodies  to  the  acetins  are  produced  by  heating 
glycerine  with  the  homologues  of  acetic  acid.  Many  of  these  bodies 
have  been  prepared. 

Tributyrin,  C3H5(O.CO.C3H7)3,  occurs  naturally  in  butter  along 
with  tricapronin,  tricaprylin,  tricaprinin,  trilaurin,  trimyrisin.  tri- 
palmitin,  tristearin,  and  triolein. 


LECITHIN.  401 

Monopalmitin,  C3H5(OH2)O.C16H3,0),  is  solid,  and  melts  at 
58°  ;  dipabnitin,  C3H5(OH)(C1GH3102)2,  at  59°  ;  tripalmitin, 
C3H5(C16H3102)3,  at  63°.  The  latter  is  found  in  nearly  all  animal 
and  vegetable  fats.  It  is  most  easily  obtained  from  olive  oil,  which  is 
a  mixture  of  that  substance  with  triolein,  03115(0.0! 8H330)3,  by 
cooling,  and  pressing  the  solid  palmitin  from  the  liquid  olein,  and  re- 

tallising  from  a  mixture  of  alcohol  and  ether.  It  forms  pearly 
plates  difficultly  soluble  in  alcohol.     It  melts  about  46°. 

Mono-,  di-,  and  tristearin  can  be  artificially  prepared  from  stearic 
acid  and  glycerine.  The  latter  is  a  very  general  constituent  of 
natural  fats,  animal  fats  or  tallows  being  composed  principally  of 
that  body  with  a  little  tripalmitin  and  triolein. 

On  treating  tallow  with  cold  ether,  the  two  latter  bodies  may  be 
extracted,  most  of  the  tristearin  remaining  behind.  It  may  be  dis- 
solved and  crystallised  from  warm  ether,  and  got  in  pearly  scales 
almost  insoluble  in  cold  alcohol  and  only  very  slightly  so  in  warm 
ether.  It  melts  at  63°.  If  it  be  not  heated  above  65°  during  the 
experiment  it  solidifies  again  at  61°,  and  then  only  melts  again  at 
66°.  If  it  be  heated,  however,  higher  than  67°,  it  solidifies  again  at 
51°,  and  then  melts  at  53°,  but  returns  to  the  melting  point,  63°, 
after  some  time. 

Other  ethers  occurring  in  natural  fats  will  be  considered  under 
the  respective  acids. 

697.  Lecithin. — This  name  is  applied  to  several  bodies  of  very 
similar  chemical  and  physical  properties  derived  from  brain  sub- 
stance, nerves,  blood  corpuscles,  gall,  &c.,  and  also  from  some  vege- 
table substances  (maize,  etc.),  and  which  appear,  indeed,  as  constant 
constituents  of  the  cell  substance  of  organised  bodies.  All  these 
bodies,  when  decomposed  by  water,  acids,  or  bases,  give  glycerine- 
phosphoric  acid,  neurine,  and  fatty  acids. 

Every  lecithin  is  a  felt  containing  only  two  fatty  acid  radicals,,  the 
third  hydroxyl  group  being  replaced  by  ethylen-trimethyl  amnionic 
hydrate  (neurine)  in  combination  with  phosphoric  acid. 

The  following  general  formula,  in  which  X  may  be  supposed  to

from  blood  vessels,  cuticular  substance,  &c,  rubbed  up  to  a  thin 
paste  with  water,  and  this  repeatedly. shaken  out  with  ether,  at  a 
temperature  of  about  0°,  until  no  more  fat  or  cholesterine  is  taken  up. 
The  insoluble  residue  is  then  filtered  from  excess  of  water  and  pressed, 
after  which  it  is  heated  with  80  %  alcohol  to  between  40°  and  45°. 
The  warm  alcoholic  solution,  after  filtration  and  cooling,  separates 
crude  lecithin  as  a  flocculent  substance,  which  is  again  washed  many 
times  with  ether  to  remove  traces  of  fatty  bodies,  and  finally  crystal- 
lised from  alcohol  at  a  temperature  of  45°.  Lecithin  may  be  obtained 
in  a  similar  manner  from  amniotic  liquid. 

It  can  also  be  easily  obtained  from  the  latter  substance  by  means 
of  ether  alcohol.  After  evaporating  the  ether  and  separating  fi-om 
the  precipitated  fats,  an  alcoholic  solution  of  cadmic  carbonate  is 
added,  which  causes  a  precipitate  of  lecithin-cadmium  chloride,  which 
is  suspended  in  water  and  treated  with  hydric  sulphide.  The  lecithin 
hydrochloride  thus  set  free  is  shaken  out  with  ether,  from  which 
solution  it  is  obtained  by  evaporation. 

Lecithin  crystallises  from  its  saturated  solution  in  alcohol  in  fine 
radially- grouped  needles,  which  dry  up  in  vacuo  to  a  white  powder, 
which  melts  on  gently  heating.  It  is  slightly  soluble  in  cold  alcohol 
and  ether,  much  more  freely  on  heating.  It  may  also  be  crystallised 
from  glacial  acetic  acid.

698.  Mercaptans. — Thio-hydrates  of  glyceryl  are  produced  by  the 
action  of  haloid  glyceryl  compounds  on  alcoholic  solution  of  potassic 
sulph-hydrate  according  to  the  general  equation  : 

C3H5.Cla(OH)3_a  +  aKSH  =  «KC1  +  C3H5(SH)a(OH)3_a, 

in  which  a  may  have  the  values  1,  2,  or  3.  They  have  all  the 
properties  of  the  mercaptans  proper,  and  exchange  the  hydrogen  of 
their  SH  groups  for  mercury,  copper,  and  similar  metals. 

Monosulph-hydrin,  glyceryl  thio-dioxyhydratc,  C3H5.(SH).(OH)2, 
obtained  by  double  decomposition  between  monochlorhydrin  and 
potassic  sulph-hydrate,  is  a  colourless,  thick  liquid,  of  sp.  gr.  1295  at 
14°,  which  gives  off  a  very  disagreeable  odour  when  warmed.  It  is 
only  slightly  soluble  in  water  and  not  at  all  in  ether. 

Disulph-hydrin,  C3H5(SH)2OH,  obtained  in  a  similar  manner, 
only  by  using  dichlorhydrin,  has  a  sp.  gr.  =  1' 342,  and  is  insoluble  in 
water  and  ether.

liquid  than  glycerine,  of  sp.  gr.  1-391,  and  only  soluble  in  strong 
alcohol. 

Glyceryl  trisulphocyanate,  C3H5.(SCN)3,  is  the  only  sulph- 
ethereal  salt  of  glycerine  known.  It  may  be  prepared  by  the  action 
of  tribromhydrin  on  potassic  sulphocyanate,  and  forms  hard  white 
needles  melting  at  126°. 

699.  Sulphonic  Acids. — The  glyceryl  mercaptans  pass  on  oxida- 
tion with  nitric  acid  into  sulphonic  acids. 

The  reaction  takes  place  pretty  directly  with  the  monosulph-hydrin, 
glycerine  mo?iosulphonic  acid,  which  yields  soluble  and  crystallisable 
salts,  being  formed  : 


SH  ~a\s6"oOH 


OH  +  30  ==  C3H5f  OH 


Glycerine  disulphonic  acid  is  easily  obtained  in  the  form  of  potassic 
salt  by  boiling  dichlorhydrin  with  a  concentrated  solution  of  neutral 
potassic  sulphite  : 

C3H5(0H)C12  +  2(K.S02OK)  =  2KC1  +  C3H5(OH).(S02.OK)2. 

Trichlorhydrin  yields  in  a  similar  manner  the  tribasic  glyceryl  tri- 
mlphonic  acid : 

C3H5C13  +  3K.S02.OK  =  3KC1  +  C3H5(S02.OK)3. 

Nitrogen  Compounds  of  Glycerine. 

700.  Very  few  bodies  of  this  class  are  known  in  a  pure  condition. 

Although  the  haloid  glycerine  compounds,  like  the  haloid  com- 
binations of  all  other  alcohol  radicals,  act  upon  aqueous  ammonia,  the 
products,  especially  in  the  case  of  the  di-  and  tri-substitution,  are  so 
numerous  and  complicated  that  a  perfect  separation  becomes  almost 
impossible. 

As  far  as  is  known,  however,  they  are  basic  compounds  corre- 
sponding to  the  alkylamines. 

By  heating  dichlorhydrin  with  aqueous  ammonia,  the  hydro- 
chlorate  of  a  glyceramine,  or  a  basic  substance  which  may  either  be 
glyceryl  hydratamide,  C3H5(OH)2lSrH2,  or  glyceryl  oxide  amide, 
C3H5(:  0).NH2,  is  formed  along  with  amnionic  chloride. 

Homologues  of  Allyl  and  Glyceryl  Derivatives. 

Homologues  of  the  glyceryl  compounds  with  four  carbon  atoms 
are  not  known  as  yet ;  several  penta-  and  hexacarbon  homologues  are, 
however,  known. 

701.  lsoamyl  Glycerine. — Isoamylene  dibromide  is  converted  by 
strong  alcoholic  potash  solution  into  potassic  bromide  and  brom- 
isoamylene,  C5H9.Br.  This  latter  is  very  probably  a  mixture  of 
several  isomeric  bodies,  and  gives,  on  fractional  distillation,  a  mobile 
oil,  boiling  between  100°  and  110°  and  of  not  unpleasant  odour. 

Owing  to  its  conversion,  under  the  influence  of  hydrates,  into  a 
trihydric  alcohol,  the  following  formula  appears  most  likely  to  ex- 
press its  constitution  :

produced,  which  yields,  on  saponification,  brom-isoamylene  dihydrate, 
C5H9Br(OH)2,  from  which  the  bromine  may  be  removed  by  long

702.  Pseudo-Diallyl  Alcohol. — When  diallyl  is  heated  with  hydric 
iodide,  a  compound  of  diallyl  with  two  molecules  of  hydric  iodide 
(§  491,  2)  is  formed,  and  also  a  compound  containing  but  one  molecule 
of  HI,  thus  : 

CH2:CH.CH2.CH2.CH:CH2  +  HI 
=  CH2  :  GH.CH2.CH2.CHI.GH3. 

This  iodide  boils  at  164°-165°,  and  is  converted  on  heating  with 
argentic  acetate  into  the  salt  CH2 :  CH.CH2.CH(O.C2H30)CH3 
(boiling  point  150°-160°),  which  gives  on  saponification  pseudo-diallyl

703.  By  replacement  by  hydroxyl  of  one  of  the  hydrogen  atoms 
of  the  alcohol  radical  contained  in  a  fatty  acid,  compounds  are  obtained

other  elements  (halogens)  or  radicals  (amides,  &c.)  in  similar  manner 
to  the  replacement  of  the  hydroxyl  groups  of  acids  or  alcohols  \  further, 
the  hydrogen  atoms  can  be  replaced  by  metals  and  the  radicals  of 
acids  and  alcohols. 


406      DERIVATIVES   OF  THE  ALCOHOL  ACID   RADICALS,  CnH,u_2. 

705.  The  following  are  amongst  the  most  generally  applicable 
methods  of  preparation  : — 

1 .  Those  of  the  glycols  which  contain  the  primary  alcohol  group, 
CH2.OH,  at  least  once,  are  converted  into  hydroxy-acids  on  gentle  oxi- 
dation, as  by  atmospheric  oxygen  in  presence  of  platinum  black  or  by 
dilute  nitric  acid  : 

CnH2n(OH).CH2.OH  +  20  =  H20  +  CnH2n(OH).CO.OH. 

2.  The  hydroxy-aldehydes  (§§  653  and  656)  absorb  oxygen  from 
the  air  and  reduce  the  oxides  of  noble  metals  : 

CnH2n(OH).CO.H  +  0  =  CnH2n(OH).CO.OH. 

3.  The  fatty  acids  yield  mono-substitution  products  on  heating 
with  the  halogens,  and,  when  the  nucleus  contains  at  least  three  car- 
bon atoms,  give  the  a  derivative  in  by  far  the  greatest  quantity 

CH3.CH2.CO.OH  +  Br2  =  HBr  +  OH3.CHBr.CO.OH 

Propionic  acid.  a-Broui- propionic  acid. 

On  long  boiling  the  alkali  salts  of  these  latter,  they  decompose  into 
metallic  haloid  and  hydroxy-acid  : 

CH2.Cl.CO.OK  +  HOH  =  KC1  +  CH2(OH).CO.OH, 

the  process  occurring  in  shorter  time  in  presence  of  free  alkali : 

CH2Cl.CO.OK  +  KOH  =  KC1  +  CH2(OH).CO.OK. 

4.  The  aldehyde  and  ketone  acids  derived  from  the  pentavalent 
nucleus  CnH2n  _  3  (see  later)  combine  with  hydrogen  and  are  con- 
verted into  hydroxy-acids,  the  first  into  primary,  the  second  into

ways  into  secondary  a-alcohol  acids. 

a.  Aldehydes  unite  directly  with  hydro-cyanic  acid  to  form  an 
alkylidene  hydrate  cyanide  :

The  secondary  a-hydroxy-acids  are  therefore  alkylidene  hydrate 
carbonic  acids  : 

OnH2n'+  i-CH  <   qq  qjj 

6.  Tertiary  a-hydroxy-acids  can  be  prepared  in  similar  manner 
from  the  ketones  when  a  mixture  of  ketone  and  hydro-cyanic  acid  is 
decomposed  by  a  mineral  acid  : 

CH3>C0  +  HCN  =  cI3>C(°H)-C]Sr 

CH3>C(0H)-CN  +  HC1  +  2H2°  =  qh3>C(OH).CO.OH 
+  NH4C1. 

7.  In  similar  manner  to  the  formation  of  fatty  acids  from  the 
alkyl  haloids  of  next  lower  carbon  contents  the  alcohol  acids  can  be 
obtained  from  the  olefine  hydrate  haloids  (§  493).  The  latter  com- 
bine with  potassic  cyanide  to  olefine  hydrate  cyanides  : 

CH2(0H).CH2C1  +  KCN  =  KC1  +  CH2(OH).CH2.CN, 


408      DERIVATIVES   OF   THE   ALCOHOL   ACID  RADICALS,  CnH2n_2. 

and  from  these,  olefine  hydrate  carbonic  acids,  which  must  be  at  least 
/3-oxy-acids,  are  readily  obtained  : 

CH,(OH).CH2.CN  +  HC1  +  20H2  =  CH2(OH).CH2.CO.OH 
+  NH4C1. 

8.  A  method  of  very  general  application  for  the  formation  of 
tertiary  a -alcohol  acids  consists  in  the  decomposition  of  neutral  ethereal 
oxalates  with  zinc  dialkyls.  If  they  are  mixed  together,  or  if  the 
oxalate  be  heated  with  an  alkyl  iodide  and  zinc,  and  the  product  decom- 
posed by  water,  the  ethereal  salt  of  a  tertiary  hydroxy-acid  separates :

706.  On  heating  in  sealed  tubes  with  concentrated  hydriodic  acid 
the  alcohol  acids  are  reduced  to  the  fatty  acid  of  like  carbon  nucleus  :

By  dry  distillation,  or  better  by  heating  with  dilute  sulphuric  acid, 
the  a-hydroxy-acida  are  split  up  into  formic  acid  and  an  aldehyde 
(secondary)  or  a  ketone  (tertiary)  : 

Cn,H2rr+1.CH(OH).CO.OH  =  CnH2n+1.CH:0  +  H.CO.OH 
(Cn.H2n.+  1)2.C(OH).CO.OH  =  (Cn'H2n,+  1)2CO  +  H.CO.OH. 

If  oxidising  agents  are  also  present  the  formic  acid  is  in  great  part 
converted  into  carbonic  anhydride,  the  aldehyde  into  the  corresponding 
fatty  acid. 

707.  A  peculiar  property  of  the  oxy-acids  consists  in  their  power 
to  form  two  different  ether-like  derivatives  when  gently  warmed  with 
acids  for  some  time,  or  by  long  standing  in  a  perfectly  dry  atmosphere. 
Two  molecules  then  so  behave  that  one  acts  as  an  alcohol,  the  other  as 
an  acid :

This  first  ethereal  anhydride  is  at  once  both  alcohol  and  monobasic 
acid,  and  is  slowly  decomposed  by  water  into  two  molecules  of  tht- 
oxy-acid,  or  quickly  by  alkalies  yielding  salts  of  the  latter.     In  dry 


HALOGEN-SUBSTITUTED   ACETIC  ACIDS.  409

Compounds  of  the  Radical  Glycolyl,  — CH2.C=. 

708.  The  tetrachloride  of  this  radical,  CH2C1.CC13,  is  known,  and 
has  already  been  mentioned  (§  473),  as  tetrachlor  ethane,  obtained  from 
ethane  by  direct  chlorination.  It  is  a  colourless  oil,  which  boils  at 
102°,  and  on  heating  with  solution  of  potassic  hydrate  is  converted 
into  potassic  glycollate  : 

CH2C1.CC13  +  5KOH  =  4KC1  +  CH2(OH).CO.OK  +  2H20. 

709.  Halogen-substituted  acetic  haloids  are  obtained  either  from 
acetic  chloride  or  bromide  by  action  of  free  halogens  : 

CH3.COCI  +  Cl2  =  HC1  +  CH2Cl.COCl ; 

or  by  decomposition  of  glycollic  acid  or  its  salts  by  the  phosphorus 
haloids  : 
CH2(OH).CO.OH  +  2PC15  =  2P0C13  4-  2HC1  +  CH2Cl.COCl; 

and  finally  from  mono-halogen  substitution  derivatives  of  acetic  acid 
by  phosphorus  haloids  : 

3CH2Cl.CO.OH  +  PCI3  =  P(OH)3  +  3CH2C1.C0C1. 

They  unite  the  properties  of  alkyl  haloids  with  those  of  the  oxygenated 
acid  radicals,  and  react  with  water  to  form  substituted  acetic  acids : 

CH2CLC0C1  +  H20  =  HC1  +  CH2Cl.CO.OH. 

Chlor-acetic  chloride,  CH2Cl.COCl,  chlorinated  acetylic  chloride,  is 
a  colourless  fuming  liquid  of  sp.  gr.  P495  at  0°,  boiling  at  105°. 

Brow-acetic  chloride,  CH2Br.COCl,  is  obtained  from  brom-acctic 
acid  and  phosphoric  pentachloride  as  a  liquid  boiling  at  134°.  With 
water  it  yields  hydrochloric  acid  and  brom-acetic  acid. 

The  isomeric  chlor-acetic  bromide,  ClI2Cl.COBr,  prepared  from 
chlor-acetic  acid  and  phosphoric  bromide,  also  boils  at  134°,  but  is  de- 
composed by  water  into  hydrobromic  and  chlor-acetic  acids. 

Brom-acetic  bromide  boils  at  150°. 

Halogen  Substitution  Derivatives  of  Acetic  Acid. 

710.  These  compounds,  which  stand  in  the  same  relation  to  gly- 
collic acid  as  the  alkyl  haloids  to  the  alcohols,  are,  as  a  rule,  prepared 
from  acetic  acid  or  anhydride. 

Chlor-acetic  acid,  CH2Cl.CO.OH,  is  formed  by  the  action  of 
chlorine  gas  in  sunlight  on  acetic  acid  heated  to  nearly  the  boiling 
point  : 

CH3.CO.OH  +  Cl2  =  HC1  +  CH2Cl.CO.OH. 


410      DERIVATIVES   OF  THE  ALCOHOL  ACID  RADICALS,  CnH2n_2. 

Instead  of  operating  in  sunlight,  some  iodine  can  be  dissolved  in 
the  acetic  acid  and  chlorine  then  passed  into  the  liquid.  Iodine 
chloride  is  first  formed,  which  reacts  with  the  acetic  acid,  forming 
chlor-acetic  and  hydriodic  acids ;  the  latter,  by  action  of  further  quanti- 
ties of  chlorine,  yields  hydrochloric  acid  and  iodine  chloride,  which 
reacts  anew  on  the  acetic  acid. 

In  this  process  some  dichlor  acetic  acid  is  always  formed,  which 
can  only  be  removed  from  the  monochlor  acid  with  difficulty ;  it  is, 
therefore,  more  usual,  by  action  of  chlorine,  to  convert  acetic  anhydride 
into  acetic  chloride  and  chlor-acetic  acid  (§  624),  and  to  then  separate 
the  products  by  fractional  distillation. 

Chlor-acetic  acid  crystallises  in  rhombic  tables  or  prisms,  melting 
at  62°  and  boiling  at  185°-187°.  They  have  a  caustic  action  on  the 
skin  and  deliquesce  in  air.  The  salts  are  mostly  readily  soluble  in 
water  and  crystallisable.  The  potassic  salt,  CH2Cl.CO.OK,  separates 
in  nacreous  plates  on  neutralising  a  cold  alcoholic  solution  of  potassic 
hydrate  with  one  of  the  acid.     An  acid  potassic  salt : 

CH2CLC0.0K,CH2C1.C0.0H, 

is  also  known.  On  addition  of  argentic  nitrate  to  a  concentrated  solu- 
tion of  the  neutral  potassic  salt,  a  scaly  precipitate  of  argentic  chlor- 
acetate,  CH2Cl.CO.OAg,  is  formed,  which  detonates  when  heated  to 
120°  in  the  dry  state.  All  its  salts  are  decomposed  on  boiling  with 
water,  glycollic  acid  being  formed  (§  705,  3). 

Ethylic  chlor-acetate,  CH2Cl.CO.O.C2H5,  is  formed  by  saturating 
a  solution  of  one  part  of  chlor-acetic  acid  in  four  to  five  parts  of 
alcohol  with  hydrochloric  acid.  After  standing  for  twenty-four  hoars, 
ethylic  chloride  and  the  greater  part  of  the  alcohol  are  removed  by 
distillation  from  the  water  bath,  and  the  cooled  residue  mixed  with 
several  times  its  volume  of  water.  The  lower  oily  layer  is  then 
washed  several  times  with  water,  dried  over  calcic  chloride,  and  puri- 
fied by  distillation.  It  is  also  obtained  by  the  careful  addition  of  acetic 
chloride  to  ethylic  alcohol : 

CEUC1.COC1  +  HO.C2H5  =  HC1  +  CH2Cl.CO.O.C2H5. 

It  is  a  colourless,  mobile  liquid,  heavier  than  water,  boiling  at 
143°-144°,  and  whose  vapours  attack  the  eye  violently. 

711.  Brom-acetic  acid,  CEUBr.CO.OH,  is  best  obtained  by  heating 
equal  molecules  of  bromine  and  glacial  acetic  acid  to  120°-130°  in 
strong  sealed  glass  tubes.  It  crystallises  in  colourless,  readily  fusible 
rhombohedra,  and  boils  at  20S°.  Its  ethylic  salt,  CH2Br.CO.O.C2H5, 
boils  with  partial  decomposition  at  159°. . 

Iod-acetic  acid,  CH2I.CO.OH.  On  heating  an  alcoholic  solu- 
tion of  ethylic  broru- acetate  with  potassic  iodide,  ethylic  iod-acetate  is 
formed,  which  is  separated  on  addition  of  water  as  a  brown  oil 
which  cannot  be  distilled  without  decomposition.  This  is  readily 
saponified  by  solution  of  baric  hydrate,  and  the  resulting  baric  salt,  on 
treatment  with  the  requisite  quantity  of  sulphuric  acid,  gives  a  solu- 
tion of  iod-acetic  acid.  On  evaporating  this  in  vacuo,  iod-acetic  acid 
is  left  in  colourless  rhombic  tables,  which  melt  at  82°  and  decompose 
at  higher  temperatures.  It  is  readily  soluble  in  water,  but  does  not 
deliquesce  in  air.     The  silver  salt  readily  decomposes  in  presence  of 


GLYCOLLIC  ACID.  411 

water  into  argentic  iodide  and  glycollic  acid.  By  heating  with  con- 
centrated hydriodic  acid  it  is  converted  into  acetic  acid. 

Gly collie  Acid. 

712.  Gly  collie  acid,  hydroxy-acetic  acid,  or  methene  hydrate  car- 
bonic acid,  CH2(OH).CO.OH,  was  first  obtained  by  oxidation  of  an 
aqueous  solution  of  glycocine  acid  with  nitrous  acid. 

It  is  further  formed  by  the  oxidation  of  ethylene  glycol  by  air  and 
platinum  black  : 

CH2(OH).CH2.OH  +  20  =  CH2(OH).CO.OH  +  H20. 

In  large  quantity  it  is  prepared  by  the  oxidation  of  ethylic  alcohol 
with  nitric  acid.  100  grams  of  80  %  alcohol  are  placed  in  a  glass 
cylinder,  at  most  5  cm.  wide.  50  grams  of  water  are  then  added  by 
means  of  a  funnel  tube  drawn  to  a  capillary  point,  so  as  to  form  a 
layer  below  the  alcohol,  and  then  170  grams  of  nitric  acid,  of  sp.  gr. 
1*35,  similarly  poured  in,  forming  a  layer  below  the  water.  The  three 
layers  mix,  on  quiet  standing  (in  about  five  days  at  20°-22°),  with  oxi- 
dation of  the  alcohol  and  evolution  of  gas.  The  homogeneous  liquid 
is  then  evaporated  in  small  portions  to  a  syrup  on  the  water  bath, 
and  this — a  mixture  of  oxalic,  glyoxalic,  and  glycollic  acids  and  gly- 
oxal — after  dilution  with  ten  times  its  volume  of  water,  neutralised 
at  the  boiling  temperature  with  powdered  chalk.  On  cooling,  the 
whole  becomes  a  stiff  pulp  of  crystals,  which  is  mixed  with  an  equal 
bulk  of  alcohol,  strained  and  pressed.  The  alcoholic  filtrate  serves  for 
the  preparation  of  glyoxal.  The  mixture  of  calcic  salts  is  boiled  with 
water  and  filtered  boiling ;  calcic  oxalate  remains  undissolved ;  the 
cooled  filtrate  deposits  first  calcic  glyoxalate,  or  a  double  compound  of 
it,  with  calcic  glycollate,  whilst  the  greater  part  of  the  latter  remains 
in  the  mother  liquor.  In  order  to  remove  the  slight  portion  of  gly- 
oxalate still  remaining  in  solution,  the  mother  liquor  is  boiled  with 
calcic  hydrate :

and  the  filtered  solution  evaporated.  Glycollic  acid  is  then  liberated 
by  precipitation  of  the  calcium  with  oxalic  acid. 

Glycollic  acid  is  prepared  from  chlor-acetic  acid  by  slightly  over- 
neutralising  an  aqueous  solution  of  the  latter  with  potassic  hydrate 
and  then  heating  to  boiling  for  a  long  time.  Whenever  an  acid  reaction 
is  observed  a  slight  excess  of  alkali  is  added,  until  the  reaction  of  the 
liquid  remains  faintly  alkaline  after  long  boiling.  It  then  contains 
potassic  chloride  and  potassic  glycollate.  After  slight  acidulation 
with  sulphuric  acid,  cupric  sulphate  is  added,  and  the  mixture  allowed 
to  stand  some  days,  when  green  crusts  of  the  difficultly  soluble  cupric 
glycollate  separate,  which  is  readily  obtained  chemically  pure  by  re- 


412 

crystallisation  from  boiling  water.  The  boiling  aqueous  solution  is 
then  decomposed  by  hydric  sulphide,  filtered  from  cupric  sulphide,  and 
evaporated  to  a  syrup  on  the  water  bath. 

On  standing  in  a  desiccator  the  syrupy  glycollic  acid  solidifies 
after  a  time  to  a  colourless,  indistinctly  crystalline  mass,  melting  at 
80°  and  deliquescing  in  air.  It  is  a  strong  acid,  and  is  readily 
soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether. 

On  long  heating  to  100°  the  greater  part  volatilises,  leaving  some 
glycoUide  (§  713). 

By  heating  with  sulphuric  acid  it  is  decomposed  into  formic  acid 
and  formic  aldehyde,  the  latter  appearing  as  paraformic  aldehyde,  and 
the  formic  acid  in  great  part  splitting  up  into  water  and  carbonic 
oxide  : 

3CH2(OH).CO.OH.  =  (CH2 : 0)3  +  3HCO.OH. 

Oxidising  agents  readily  convert  it  into  oxalic  acid,  glyoxalic  acid 
probably  being  formed  as  an  intermediate  product. 

By  heating  with  hydrochloric  or  hydrobromic  acids  it  is  recon- 
verted into  chlor  or  brom  acetic  acid  : 

CH2(OH).CO.OH  +  HC1  =  CH2Cl.CO.OH  +  H20, 

whilst  hydriodic  acid  converts  it  into  acetic  acid. 

Phosphoric  chloride  converts  it  into  chlor-acetic  chloride  (§  709). 

The  alkali  salts  of  glycollic  acid  are  extremely  soluble.  The 
calcic  salt,  [CH2(OH).CO.O]2Ca,4H20,  crystallises  in  fine  needles, 
which  dissolve  in  82  parts  of  water  at  10°  and  in  19  parts  at  100°. 
Argentic  glycollate,  [CH2(OH).CO.OAg]2,H20,  is  a  crystalline  pre- 
cipitate which  dissolves,  with  blackening,  in  boiling  water. 

Ethereal  Salts  of  Glycollic  Acid. 

712a.  These  compounds  are  obtained  by  heating  gly collide  with 
the  monacid  alcohols.  FAhylic  glycollate,  CH2(OH)CO.O.C2H5,  is  a 
neutral  liquid,  boiling  at  150°,  is  miscible  with  water  and  readily 
saponifiable  by  alkalies. 

Salts  are  also  obtainable  in  which  glycollic  acid  plays  the  part  of 
the  base,  as  in  aceto-glycollic  acid.  By  heating  ethylic  chlor-acetate 
with  anhydrous  sodic  acetate  there  is  obtained  ethylic  aceto-gly- 
collate  :

CO.O.C2H5  C0.0.C2H5 

as  a  thin  oil  of  agreeable  fruity  odour,  boiling  at  179°.  If  two  mole- 
cules of  this  are  mixed  with  not  quite  one  molecule  of  calcic  hydrate, 
calcic  aceto-glycollate  is  obtained  : 

2C2H3O.O.CH2.CO.O.C2H5  +  Ca(OH)2  =  2HO.C2H5 

+  (C2H3O.O.CH2.CO.O)2Ca, 

which  on  evaporation  of  the  solution  is  obtained  in  prismatic  crystals. 
By  boiling  with  excess  of  base,  the  methene-acetate  group  is  readily 
saponified  : 

(C2H3O.O.CH2.CO.O)2Ca  +  Ca(OH)2  =  (C2H30.0)2Ca 
+  (HO.CH2.CO.O)2Ca. 


GLYCOLLIC  ACID.  413 

713.  Both  the  ethereal  anhydrides  (§  707)  of  glycollic  acid  are 
known.  By  long  fusion  on  the  water  bath,  or  by  contact  with  the 
vapours  of  sulphuric  anhydride,  glycollic  acid  is  converted,  with  loss 
of  water,  into  an  amorphous  mass,  insoluble  in  water,  the  first  ethereal 
anhydride,  which  fuses  at  128°-130°  and  on  long  heating  yields,  with 
partial  volatilisation,  the  second  ethereal  anhydride,  glycollide  :

but  is  most  readily  obtained  by  long  heating  of  potassic  chlor-acetate

to  glycollic  acid,  and  which  with  two  molecules  of  alkali  quickly 
saponifies  to  gly collates. 

Ethereal  Derivatives  of  Glycollic  Acid. 

714.  These  compounds,  in  which  the  hydroxylic  hydrogen  atom  of 
the  alcohol  group  is  replaced  by  an  alcohol  radical,  are  obtained  by 
double  decomposition  between  an  alkaline  chlor-acetate  and  a  sodic 
alkylate,  when  one  molecule  of  the  chlor-acetic  acid  is  employed  to  two 
atoms  of  sodium  dissolved  in  the  respective  alcohol,  the  mixture  being 
heated  at  the  end  of  the  violent  reaction  :

Sodic  chloride  separates  whilst  the  sodic  salt  of  the  alkyl  glycollic 
acid  remains  dissolved  in  the  excess  of  alcohol,  from  which  it  can  be 
precipitated  by  addition  of  ether.  The  alkyl  glycollic  acid  can  be 
liberated  by  addition  of  sulphuric  acid. 

Methyl  glycollic  acid,  CH3.O.CH2. CO.OH,  or  methoxy acetic  acid,  is 
a  colourless,  thick,  strongly  acid  liquid  of  sp.  gr.  1*18  and  boiling 
point  198°.  Its  alkali  salts  are  deliquescent,  but  crystallisable,  the 
calcic  salt  amorphous ;  the  readily  soluble  zinc  and  copper  salts  crys- 
tallise beautifully  with  two  molecules  of  water  :

Isoamyl  glycollic  acid  boils  at  235°. 

714a.  In  addition  to  the  above  bodies,  which  correspond  to  the 
mixed  ethers,  the  simple  ether  anhydride  of  glycollic  acid — diglycollic 
acid — 0(CH2.CO.OH)2,  is  also  known,  and  is  isomeric  with  the  first 
ethereal  anhydride.  It  is  obtained,  together  with  glycollic  acid,  by 
boiling  chlor-acetic  acid  with  bases,  the  yield  being  especially  rich  on 
employment  of  milk  of  lime  :

The  difficultly  soluble  calcic  salt  separates  from  the  solution  in

by  oxalic  or  sulphuric  acids. 

Diglycollic  acid  is  also  obtained  by  oxidation  of  diethylene  alcohol 
with  nitric  acid.  It  forms  large  transparent  rhombic  crystals,  which 
dissolve  readily  in  water  and  alcohol  and  melt  at  148°.  It  is  a 
dibasic  acid,  yielding  acid  and  normal  salts  :

By  heating  ethylic  chlor-acetate  with  dried  sodic  carbonate  di- 
glycollic ethyl-ether  is  obtained :

as  a  colourless  oil,  heavier  than  water,  which  boils  at  240°  and  yields 
salts  of  diglycollic  acid  on  saponification.

capto-glycollic  acid,  has  been  prepared  by  heating  potassic  chlor-acetate 
with  potassic  sulph-hydrate  : 

Cl.CH2.CO.OK  +  HSK  =  KC1  +  HS.CH2.CO.OK. 

It  is  best  separated  by  treatment  of  the  amorphous  difficultly 
soluble  lead  salt  with  hydric  sulphide,  and  is  then  obtained  on  evapo- 
ration of  the  aqueous  solution  as  a  nearly  solid,  yellow,  deliquescent 
mass,  of  strongly  acid  reaction. 

The  ethylic  salt,  HS.CH2.CO.O.C2H5,  is  readily  prepared  by  boil-

ing  the  acid  with  alcohol  and  some  hydrochloric  acid.     It  behaves  as 
a  true  mercaptan,  e.g.  yields  the  crystalline  mercury  compounds  : 

Cl.Hg.S.CH2.OO.O.C2H5  and  Hg(S.CH2.CO.O.C2H5)2, 

and  is  readily  oxidised  by  nitric  acid  to  sulphonacetic  acid. 

Thio-diybj  collie  acid,  S(CH2.CO.OH)2,  is  formed  by  heating  chlor- 
acetic  acid  with  potassic  sulphide  ;  its  ethylic  salt,  S(CH2.CO.O.C2H5)2, 
a  yellow  oil  boiling  at  267°,  is  formed,  together  with  mercapto-gly- 
collic  acid,  by  heating  ethylic  chlor-acetate  with  an  alcoholic  solution 
of  potassic  sulph-hydrate  : 

Cl.CH,.CO.O.C2H5  +  HSK  =  KC1  +  HS.CH2.CO.O.C2H5

KS.CH2.CO.O.C2H5  +  Cl.CH2.CO.O.C2H5  =  KC1

The  acid  is  solid  and  crystallises   in  readily  soluble  rhombic  tables, 
melting  at  129°. 

715a.  Sulphonacetic  acid,  CH2(S02.OH).CO.OH,  or  sutyho-ocetic

Prior  to  the  discovery  of  glycollic  acid  glycocine  had  already  been 
obtained  from  different  animal  substances  by  boiling  with  mineral 
acids  or  alkalies — e.g.  from  gelatine  (hence  the  name  glycocine  ■=  sugar 
of  gelatine),  from  hippuric  acid,  and,  together  with  taurocholic  acid 
(comp.  §  528),  from  the  glycocholic  acid  occurring  in  the  gall.  It  is 
most  readily  obtained  from  hippuric  acid  (benzoyl  glycocoll),  contained 
in  large  quantity  in  the  urine  of  herbivora,  by  boiling  for  some 
hours  with  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid.  The  solution  is  evapo- 
rated nearly  to  dryness,  and  the  pulpy  residue  extracted  with  a  little 
cold  water,  which  takes  up  glycocine  hydrochloride  and  leaves  the

but,  as  in  the  preparation  of  the  alkylaniines,  the  process  goes  in  part 
further,  diglycollamic  acid  and  triglvcollamic  acid  being  formed. 

Glycocine  forms  large,  hard,  monoclinic  prisms,  unalterable  in  air, 
of  strongly  sweet  taste  and  neutral  reaction,  which  dissolve  in  four 
times  their  weight  of  cold  water,  but  little  in  alcohol  and  not  at  all 
in  ether.  It  melts  at  170°,  and  decomposes  at  slightly  higher  tem- 
perature with  carbonisation  and  formation  of  ammonia  and  some 
methvlamine.  The  latter  is  especially  formed  on  heating  with  baric 
hydrate :

718.  As  organic  amnionic  salt  glycocine  is  altered  by  strong  acids, 
bases* or  the  salts  of  both. 

By  treatment  with  strong  mineral  acids  glycocine  salts  are  formed, 
which  being  at  the  same  time  free  organic  acids,  have  an  acid  reaction. 
These  reactions  occur  in  two  stages. 

On  dissolving  a  molecule  of  glycocine  (C4H10N2O4)  in  a  molecule 
of  hydrochloric  acid,  colourless  prisms  of  the  formula  : 

C4H10N2O4.HCl, 

crystallise  on  cooling,  which,  w\th    excess  of  acid,  yield    the   very

The  latter  gives  with    platinic    chloride  a  readily  soluble,    crystal-

(1I0.C0.CH2.NH3)2S04 

crystallises  with  difficulty. 

Strong  basic  hydrates  give  salts  of  alkaline  reaction  which  are  at 
the  same  time  free  amine  bases  :

719.  Weak  basic  metallic  oxides  or  hydrates  are  also  taken  up  by 
glycocine.  They  are  mostly  the  oxides  of  metals  which  readily 
replace  the  hydrogen  of  ammonia  and  amides,  such  as  copper,  mer- 
cury, and  silver.  The  resulting  crystallisable  compounds  are  there- 
fore probably  not  analogous  to  those  of  the  alkalies.  Especially 
characteristic  is  the  cupric  compound,  obtained  by  boiling  a  solution 
of  glycocine  with  cupric  oxide,  which  separates  from  the  deep  blue 
liquid  in  beautiful  blue  needles  of  the  formula  :

From  these  bodies  the  metal  in  union  with  nitrogen  cannot  be

On  heating  an  alcoholic  solution  of  glycocine  with  ethylic  iodide

It  remains  on  evaporation  in  colourless,  rhombic  crystals,'  which 
are  also  readily  soluble  in  water  or  ether.  On  shaking  the  aqueous 
solution  with  argentic  oxide,  hydriodic  acid  is  removed,  but  on  evapo- 
rating the  ethylic  amido-acetate,  NH2.CH2.CO.O.C2H5,  is  decomposed 
by  the  water  into  glycocine  and  ethylic  alcohol. 

720.  Diglycollamic  Acid  and  Triglycollamic  Acid. — As  already 
mentioned,  these  are  formed  in  the  preparation  of  glycocine  from  chlor- 
acetic  acid  and  excess  of  ammonia.  The  resulting  solution  contains,  in 
addition  to  ammonic  chloride  and  glycocine,  the  ammonic  salts  of 
diglycollamic  and  triglycollamic  acids.  By  evaporation  the  greater 
part  of  the  ammonic  chloride  is  removed,  and  the  mother  liquid  is 
then  boiled  with  plumbic  hydrate  until  all  ammonia  is  driven  off. 
Plumbic  triglycollamate  separates,  whilst  the  filtered  solution  contains 
glycocine  and  plumbic  diglycollamate.  This  is  then  treated  with 
hydric  sulphide  to  remove  lead,  and  boiled  with  zincic  carbonate  in 
order  to  separate  diglycollamic  acid  as  its  difficultly  soluble  zinc 
salt. 

Diglycollamic  acid,  C4H7NO,,  crystallises  in  large,  colourless, 
rhombic  prisms,  not  perceptibly  soluble  in  cold  water,  iusoluble  in 
alcohol  and  ether.  It  tastes  and  reacts  acid,  and  behaves  towards 
carbonates  as  a  monobasic  acid,  but  by  treatment  with  strong  basic 
hydrates  takes  up  two  equivalents  of  metal. 

It  is  glycocine,  in  which  the  nitrogen  is  united  to  the  methene 
carbonic  acid  residue  of  glycollic  acid,  CH2.CO.OH,  in  place  of  a

On  treatment  of  the  tribasic  silver  salt  with  ethylic  iodide,  tri- 
ethylic  trigl ycoUamate,  N(CH2C0.0.C2H5)3,  is  obtained  as  an  oily 
liquid,  very  little  soluble  in  water,  which  boils  at  290°  with  partial 
decomposition,  and  unites  with  ammonia,  forming  triglycollamic  tri- 
atnide,  N(CH2.CO.NH2)3.  This  latter  crystallises  in  difficultly 
soluble  tables  ;  these,  on  boiling  with  water,  are  converted  into  free 
ammonia  and  the  dibasic  amnionic  salt,  and  yield  a  crystalline  salt 
with  hydrochloric  acid,  N(CH2.C0.NH2)3HC1. 

721.  Glycolylimide. — On  heating  glycocine  in  a  stream  of  hydro- 
chloric acid  gas,  water  is  evolved,  and  neutral  crystalline  glycolylimide

tion of  chlor-acetic  acid  by  excess  of  alkylamine  bases.  They  behave 
like  glycocine,  yielding  saline  compounds  with  bases  and  mineral 
acids.

grown  man  excreting  about  6  —  1"3  gram  creatinine  in  24  hours.  In 
order  to  prepare  it  from  urine,  this  is  concentrated  to  about  £  of  its 
bulk,  then  made  faintly  alkaline  by  means  of  milk  of  lime,  and 
calcic  chloride  added  so  long  as  a  precipitate — consisting  mainly  of 
calcic  phosphate — falls  down.  The  nitrate  is  evaporated  to  a  syrup, 
the  sodic  chloride  which  crystallises  out  removed,  and  the  mother 
liquor  mixed  with  a  syrupy  solution  of  zincic  chloride.  The  diffi- 
cultly soluble  creatinine  zincic  chloride  soon  separates,  which  is 
purified  by  crystallisation  and  decomposed  by  boiling  with  water  and 
plumbic  oxide.  Basic  plumbic  chloride  and  zincic  oxide  precipitate 
whilst  the  solution  contains  creatinine  and  creatine — formed  from  the 
former  by  union  with  water — which,  after  evaporation  to  dryness,  are 
separated  by  means  of  alcohol. 

Creatinine  crystallises  in  long  colourless  monoclinic  prisms,  which 
dissolve  readily  in  water  and  alcohol,  and  have  a  strongly  alkaline  re- 
action. It  unites  with  acids  to  form  salts  of  neutral  reaction,  which 
contain  an  equivalent  of  acid  to  eacli  molecule  of  creatinine.  The 
hydrochloride  yields  with  platinic  chloride  a  double  salt : 

(C4H7N30,HCl)2,PtCl4, 

pretty  soluble  in  water,  difficultly  in  alcohol. 

A  very  characteristic  creatinine  salt  is  creatinine  zincic  chloride, 

(C4H7N30)2ZnCl2.  In  this  hydrogen  has  been  replaced  by  zinc 
somewhat  in  the  fashion  of  the  formula  :

It  crystallises  in  groups  of  fine  needles,  difficultly  soluble  in  water, 
insoluble  in  alcohol. 

With  hydrochloric  acid  it  yields  a  further  verv  readily  soluble 
crystalline  salt,  (< ',  M  :XaO.M< 'l),Zn< '1,. 

By  long  contact  with  water  creatinine  is  converted  into  creatine, 

daily  in  the  presence  of  basic  hydrates,  >o  that  it  can  only  be 
obtained  in  part  unaltered  from  its  salts. 

By  boiling  with  solution  of  baric-  hydrate,  ammonia  is  first  evolved, 
methyl  hydanto'in  being  formed  (§  725)  :

which  soon  decomposes  into  methyl  glycocine,  baric  carbonate,  and 
ammonia.  With  mercuric  oxide  or  plumbic  dioxide  and  sulphuric 
acid  it  yields  the  same  products  as  creatine. 

On  heating  creatinine  for  a  long  time  at  100'  with  alcohol  and 
ethylic   iodide,    ethyl  creatinint    hyd  1 1 5)N30,HI,  is 

formed,  from  which  argentic  oxide  liberates  ethyl  creatine  :

circumstances  in  the  fermentation  of  Borne  sugars.  In  the  latter  way 
it  is  formed  in  sour  milk,  in  Banerkrant,  (fee 

It  is  prepared  from  propionic  acid  by  means  of  the  halogen  sub- 
stitution products.  On  heating  <\\x  propionic  acid  with  a  molecule  of 
bromine  in  closed  tubes  to  Ion-,  the  liquid  soon  decolourises,  and  then 
contains,  together  with  much  hydrobromic  acid,  principally  a-brom- 
propionic  acid  : 

(  H  .<  II  .<  O.OH  +  Br2  =  CH3.CHBr.CO.OH  +  HBr. 
The  salts  of  this  latter,  on  boiling  with   water,  alkalies,  or  argentic 
oxides,  are  converted    into    a-oxypropionic  acid,  just  as   the  haloid 
acetic  acids  are  converted  into  glycollic  acid  : 

CH3.CHBr.CO.OAg  +  H,0  =  AgBr  +  CH3.CH(OH).CO.OH. 

Its  structure  is  shown  by  its  synthetical  preparation  from  ethylidene 
compounds,  especially  from  ethylidene  oxide  or  acetic  aldehyde  (§  390). 
On  mixing  the  latter  with  hydrocyanic  acid,  they  unite  together  to 
form  ethylidene  hydrate  cyanide,  which  on  treatment  with  strong 
hydrochloric  acid  is  converted  into  lactic  acid  even  at  the  ordinary 
temperature.  Aldehyde  ammonia  is  converted  by  prussic  acid  into 
ethylidene-amide  cyanide,  this  by  aqueous  hydrochloric  acid  into 
alanine,  and  the  latter  is  converted  into  lactic  acid  by  nitrous  acid 
(formula?  and  equations,  §  705,  5,  a  and  b). 

Other  methods  of  formation  of  ordinary  lactic  acid,  as  from  glyceric 
acid  and  pyrotartaric  acid,  will  be  mentioned  later  at  their  respective 
places. 

Lactic  acid  is  most  readily  prepared  by  a  peculiar  fermentation  of

sugar.  For  this  purpose  3  kilograms  of  cane  sugar  and  15  grams  of 
tartaric  acid  are  dissolved  in  17  litres  of  boiling  water.  Thereby  the 
cane  sugar,  C12H22On,  is  split  up  under  the  influence  of  the  tartaric 
acid,  and  with  combination  with  a  molecule  of  water,  into  2C6H1206 
(grape  sugar  and  fruit  sugar).  There  is  then  added,  to  sow  the 
necessary  ferment,  100  grams  of  old  cheese  or  of  putrid  flesh,  mixed 
with  4  litres  of  sour  milk,  and  1^  kilogram  of  zinc  white  or  zinc  car- 
bonate, and  the  whole  allowed  to  stand  for  a  long  time,  best  at  a  tem- 
perature of  40°-45°.     After  eight  to  ten  days  the  change  : 

C6Hi2^6  =  2C3HC03, 

is  finished,  and  at  the  bottom  of  the  vessel,  in  place  of  the  basic  zinc 
salt,  crusts  of  zincic  lactate  are  found,  which  are  purified  by  recrystal- 
lisation  from  hot  water  and  then  decomposed  in  boiling  solution  by 
sulphuretted  hydrogen.  The  liquid,  freed  from  zincic  sulphide,  is  then 
evaporated  to  a  thin  syrup  on  the  water  bath,  and  separated  from  any 
undecomposed  zinc  salt  or  mannite  by  solution  in  ether.  The  sepa- 
rated ethereal  solution  is  distilled  from  the  water  bath,  and  finally 
warmed  for  some  time  in  an  open  vessel. 

In  this  way  there  is  obtained  a  colourless,  strongly  acid  syrup, 
from  which,  however,  pure  lactic  acid  of  the  formula  C3H603  cannot 
be  obtained.  If  much  water  is  present  there  is  no  doubt  a  body  of 
the  formula  : 

CH3.CH(OH).C(OH)3, 

which,  on  further  evaporation,  decomposes  into  water  and  lactic  acid. 
As  soon  as  the  latter  has  attained  certain  proportions,  single  lactic 
acid  molecules  etherify,  and  both  ethereal  anhydrides  are  formed  in 
greater  proportion  the  further  the  concentration  is  carried.  The 
syrupy  preparation  termed  lactic  acid  is  therefore  a  mixture  of 
CH3.CH(OH).0(OH)3,  CH3.CH(OH)CO.OH,  C6H10O„  and  often 
also  of  C6H804.  On  further  drying  in  vacuo  over  sulphuric  acid  it 
becomes  quite  stiff,  and  then  consists  essentially  of  the  two  ethereal 
anhydrides. 

By  distillation  of  an  aqueous  solution  much  unaltered  lactic  acid 
passes  over  in  the  aqueous  vapour  ;  by  heating  the  syrupy  preparation, 
on  the  other  hand,  the  formation  of  the  ethereal  anhydrides  is  incre.: 
If  the  temperature  is  raised  slowly,  much  of  the  second  anhydride 
(lactide)  volatilises,  whilst  by  quick  heating  to  higher  temperatures 
the  greater  part  is  decomposed  into  aldehyde,  carbonic  oxide,  and 
water  : 

CH3.CH(OH).CO.OH  =  CH3.CHO  +  CO  +  H20. 

By  heating  with  dilute  sulphuric  acid  to  130°  it  is  decomposed  into 
aldehyde  and  formic  acid  : 

CH3.CH(OH).CO.OH  =  CH3.CHO  +  HCO.OH. 

Oxidising  agents,  e.g.  chromic  acid,  oxidise  it  to  acetic  acid,  carbonic 
anhydride,  and  water  : 

CH3.CH(OH).CO.OH  +  20  =  CH3.CO.OH  +  C02  +  OH2. 

By  heating  with  concentrated  hydriodic  acid,  lactic  acid  is  reduced  to 
propionic  acid  (a-iodo-propionic  acid  being  first  formed)  : 

CH3.CH(OH).CO.OH  +  2HI  =  H20  +  I2  +  CH3.CH2.CO.OH.

Putrefactive  ferments  convert  a  solution  of  lactic  acid  or  its  salts  into

731.  Lactate*. — In  the  replacement  of  hydroxylic  hydrogen  by 
metals,  lactic  acid  acts  as  a  monobasic  acid,  which  is  also  amonhydric 
alcohol.  Carbonates  only  replace  the  acid  hydrogen,  as  do  also 
most  of  the  basic  hydrates  ;  the  alkaline  salts,  on  heating  with  alkali 

tl,   have   their  alcohol-hydroxylic  hydrogen  atom  replaced  also. 

The  neutral  alkali  salts  of  lactic  acid  are  deliquescent,  also  soluble 
in  alcohol,  and  yield  on  evaporation  of  their  solutions  solid  amorphous 
masses,  which  melt  on  gentle  heating. 

Sodic  lactate,  Cll;..<  H(OH).CO.ONa,  after  long  drying  in  vacuo 
forms  a  solid  mass,  consisting  of  fine  hair-like  crystals.  When  fused 
it  dissolves  sodium  with  evolution  of  hydrogen,  and  is  converted 
partially  into  the  compound  CH3.CH(ONa)CO.ONa,  which,  like  the 
sodic  alkylates,  is  decomposed  by  water  into  free  alkali  and  neutral 
salt. 

Calcic  lactate,  [CH3.CH(OH).CO.O]2Ca,5H20,  crystallises  in  ag- 
gregates of  small  thin  needles,  soluble  in  9£  parts  of  cold  water  and 
in  alcohol.  If  the  aqueous  solution  is  mixed  with  two  molecules 
of  lactic  acid,  an  acid  salt,  O6H10CaO6,2C3H6O3,2H2O2,  crystallises  on 
evaporation.  This  may  be  expressed  by  a  formula  similar  to  that 
given  for  the  acid  acetat «

Zincic  lactate,  C6H10ZnO6,3H2O,  is  the  most  characteristic  salt  of 
lactic  acid.  It  crystallises  in  small  colourless  monoclinic  pri 
generally  united  to  crusts.  It  requires  for  solution  about  sixty  parts 
of  cold,  and  onlv  six  parts  of  boiling,  water.  It  is  nearly  insoluble  in 
alcohol.  Ferrous  lactate,  [CH3.CH(OH)CO.O]2Fe,3H20,  possesses 
similar  proper! 

732.  Ethereal  AnJa/drides  of  Lactic  Acid. — As  already  mentioned, 
the  ethereal  anhydrides  are  obtained  from  lactic  acid  in  a  dry  atmo- 
sphere even  at  ordinary  temperatures,  as  also  on  heating,  especially  at 
temperatures  above  100°.

into  lactic  acid. 

The  dehydration  easily  proceeds  further,  yielding  the  second  ethereal

This  is  obtained  in  larger  quantity  when  lactic  acid  or  the  first 
ethereal  anhydride  is  heated  for  a  long  time  at  150°  in  a  tubulated 
retort  through  which  a  slow  stream  of  air  is  drawn.  The  neck  of  the 
retort  is  soon  coated  with  a  crystalline  coating  of  lactide,  which  is 
from  time  to  time  removed  by  fusion,  washed  with  cold  alcohol,  and 
finally  crystallised  from  boiling  alcohol. 

Lactide  forms  colourless  rhombic  tables,  melting  at  124*5°  and  dis- 
tilling at  255°.  The  vapour  density  is  481 .  It  is  insoluble  in  water, 
but  is  slowly  decomposed  thereby  into  the  first  ethereal  anhydride, 
and  finally  into  lactic  acid.  It  is  much  more  readily  saponified  by 
alkalies. 

733.  Ethylic  lactatef  CK3.CU(OK).CO.O.C2H.Sf\s£oTmed  by  heating 
lactic  acid,  or  still  better  a  mixture  of  the  anhydrides,  with  alcohol  to 
170°.  Ethylic  lactate  is  separated  from  the  products  by  fractional 
distillation  as  a  colourless  liquid  of  peculiar  odour,  boiling  at  156°, 
which  mixes  with  water,  but  is  soon  decomposed  by  this  into  alcohol 
and  acid. 

Sodium  dissolves  in  pure  ethylic  lactate  with  evolution  of  hydrogen, 
as  in  an  alcohol,  yielding  the  so-called  ethylic  sodio-lactate  : 

CH3.CH(ONa)CO.O.C2H5, 

a  solid  mass  decomposed  by  water  into  free  alkali  and  ethylic  lactate 
which  then  further  react  on  each  other  as  above. 

734.  On  mixing  ethylic  lactate  with  an  acid  haloid,  e.g.  with 
acetyl  chloride,  the  alcoholic  group  of  the  former  reacts  energetically 
with  the  halogen  compound  (§  608),  ethylic  aceto-lactate  being 
formed  :

It  boils  at  177°,  has  an  agreeable  odour,  sp.  gr.  1*0458  at  17°,  and  is 
insoluble  in  water.  If  heated  with  a  little  water  to  150°,  and  then 
submitted  to  distillation,  ethylic  alcohol  passes  over,  whilst  a  strongly 
acid  syrup  of  aceto-lactic  acid,  CH3.OH(O.C2H30)CO.OH,  remains 
behind.  This  yields  in  general  gummy  salts,  completely  decomposed 
on  long  heating,  or  more  readily  by  boiling  with  alkalies,  into  lactic 
and  acetic  acids  or  the  respective  salts.

boils  at  1 44°.  a-Chlor-propionic  chloride,  also  termed  lactyl  dichloride, 
is  best  prepared  from  dry  calcic  lactate  and  phosphoric  pentachloride. 
It  is  a  liquid  fuming  in  air,  always  somewhat  decomposed  on  dis-

It  crystallises  in  colourless  leafy  crystals,  melting  at  74°  and  dis-

yields  ammonic  lactate ;  by  boiling  with  alkalies,  alkaline  lactates  and 
free  ammonia. 

Alanine,  or  amido-propionic  acid,  CH3.CH(NH2). CO.OH,  or  more

probably  .     ,  is  obtained  from  a-chlor-propionic

acid  and  ammonia,  or  more  readily  from  aldehyde  ammonia.     This  is 
dissolved   in   excess  of  aqueous   hydrocyanic   and  boiled   for  a  long 
time   with   dilute    hydrochloric    acid.       Ethylidene   amide   cyanide, 
CH3.CH.NH2 

,  first  formed,  is  thereby  decomposed  into  ammonic 
CN 
chloride  and  alanine  hydrochloride.  The  solution  is  evaporated  to 
dryness,  and  the  latter  salt  dissolved  in  alcohol.  To  prepare  alanine 
from  this,  its  aqueous  solution  is  boiled  with  plumbic  hydrate,  filtered 
from  basic  plumbic  chloride,  excess  of  lead  removed  by  sulphuretted 
hydrogen,  and  the  clear  filtrate  evaporated. 

Alanine  crystallises  in  brilliant  rhombic  prisms  of  neutral  re- 
action and  sweet  taste.  Water  dissolves  it  readily,  alcohol  difficultly, 
and  it  is  insoluble  in  ether.  By  careful  heating  it  can  be  sublimed  in 
part  unchanged,  but  readily  decomposes  into  equal  molecules  of  car- 
bonic anhydride  and  ethylamine.  It  behaves  towards  acids,  alkalies, 
salts,  and  oxides  of  the  heavy  metals  in  like  manner  to  glycocine. 
The  acid  salts,  e.g.  CH3.CH(]SrH3Cl).CO.OH,  dissolve  in  alcohol, 
react  strongly  acid,  and  generally  crystallise  well.  By  nitrous  acid 
it  is  oxidised  to  lactic  acid. 

On  heating  alanine  in  a  stream  of  hydrochloric  acid  gas  it  loses 
water  and  is  converted  into

cyanide,  and  potassic  pseudo-cyanate  be  slowly  decomposed  with  hy- 
drochloric acid,  and  the  brown  reaction  product  extracted  with  ether 
alcohol,  there  is  found  in  solution  lactyl  urea,  isomeric  with  methyl 
hydantoi'n  (§  724).  It  forms  transparent  rhombic  prisms  of  the 
formula  C4H6N202,2H20;  when  anhydrous  it  melts  at  145°  :

point  155°;  it  yields  salts,  which  in  great  part  crystallise  well,  e.g. 
CH3.CH(NH.CO.NH2)CO.OAg,  and  is  also  decomposed  by  hydro-

isomeric  with  creatine,  is  formed  from  alanine  and  cyanamide,  and

and  creatine ;  e.g.  on  heating  its  salts  are  converted  with  loss  of  water

into  salts  of  alacreatinine.     This  latter  crystallises  in  long  prisms  of

and,  like  creatinine  and  glycocyaniidine,  forms  a  difficultly   soluble 
compound  with  zincic  chloride. 

741.  Nitrites. —  By  direct  union  of  acetic  aldehyde  with  hydro- 
cyanic acid  there  is  formed  ethylidene  hydrate  cyanide,  or  lactyl  hy- 
drate nitrile,  CH3CH(OH).CN,  a  colourless  liquid  mixing  in  every 
proportion  with  water  and  alcohol.  It  boils  at  183°  with  partial  de- 
composition into  its  components,  and  in  presence  of  aqueous  mineral 
acids  is  transformed  into  amnionic  salts  and  lactic  acid. 

The  nitrile  of  ethyl-ether  lactic  acid,  CH3.CH(O.C2H5).CN,  is  ob- 
tained by  distillation  of  its  amide  with  phosphoric  anhydride  (comp. 
§  545)  as  a  clear  mobile  liquid  boiling  at  134°-135°,  whose  sp.  gr.  at 
6°  =  -918. 

2.  Par  atactic  or  Optically  Active  Ethylidene  Lactic  Acid. 

742.  Paralactic  acid  occurs,  together  with  ethylene  lactic  acid,  in 
the  juice  of  flesh,  and  is  especially  formed  in  large  quantity  during 
muscular  exertion  and  after  rigor  mortis  has  set  in.  It  can  be  obtained 
from  the  mother  liquor  from  which  creatine  has  been  crystallised 
(§  727)  by  acidulation  and  repeated  shaking  with  ether,  in  which  it 
is  soluble.  The  ethereal  solution  is  separated,  distilled,  and  the 
strongly  acid  residue,  after  addition  of  water,  treated  with  plumbic 
carbonate.  The  filtered  liquid  is  then  treated  with  hydric  sulphide  to 
remove  lead,  saturated  whilst  boiling  with  zincic  carbonate,  and  the 
liquid  evaporated  till  crystallisation  commences.  Four  to  five  times 
the  volume  of  strong  alcohol  is  then  added,  when  zincic  paralactate 
separates  as  a  crystalline  mud,  which  is  purified  by  repeated  solution 
in  water  and  precipitation  with  alcohol,  and  finally  by  reciystallisation 
from  hot  water.  The  alcoholic  filtrate  always  contains  some  zincic 
ethylene  lactate  in  addition  to  the  paralactate. 

To  prepare  it  from  commercial  flesh  extract,  the  latter  is  dissolved 
in  four  times  its  weight  of  hike- warm  water,  and  then  mixed  with 
double  the  volume  of  90  %  alcohol.  The  brown  precipitate  consists 
mainly  of  inorganic  salts  and  creatine.  The  alcoholic  liquid  contains, 
together  with  other  bodies,  the  salts  of  paralactic  acid  ;  it  is  evaporated 
to  a  syrup,  and  once  more  extracted  with  several  times  its  volume  of 
alcohol.  The  syrupy  residue  left  on  evaporating  this  last  extract  is 
acidulated  with  dilute  sulphuric  acid,  and  the  liberated  lactic  acids 
extracted  with  ether  and  purified  as  above. 

The  free  acid  is  prepared  as  a  syrup  by  treatment  of  a  warm  con 
centrated  solution  of  the  zinc  salt  with  hydric  sulphide  and  evapora- 
tion of  the  filtrate. 

Paralactic  acid  completely  resembles  fermentation  lactic  acid, 
except  that  its  aqueous  solution  rotates  the  plane  of  polarisation 
slightly  to  the  right.  By  long  standing  in  a  dry  atmosphere  at 
ordinary  temperatures  it  is  converted,  like  fermentation  lactic  acid,  into 
ethereal  anhydrides,  which,  however,  rotate  the  plane  of  a  polarised 


LACTIC  ACIDS.  433 

beam  of  light  strongly  to  the  left  (a  mixture  of  84  %  of  the  first  anhy- 
dride and  16  %  lactide  in  a  tube  -1  metre  long  =  —  85'9°). 

If  the  ethereal  anhydrides  be  prepared  by  heating,  they  are  then 
obtained  optically  inactive,  and  on  saponification  by  water  or  alkalies 
yield  ordinary  fermentation  lactic  acid. 

On  heating  paralactic  acid  with  dilute  sulphuric  acid  to  130°-150° 
it  is  resolved  into  formic  acid  and  acetic  aldehyde ;  if  chromic  acid  be 
also  employed,  acetic  acid  is  formed  from  the  latter.  These  are  the 
same  products  as  are  afforded  by  fermentation  lactic  acid,  and  there- 
fore the  two  acids  must  have  an  identical  structure,  i.e.  the  elementary 
atoms  must  be  united  together  in  the  same  order.  Fermentation  and 
para  lactic  acids  can  therefore  only  be  regarded  as  physically  isomeric 
compounds  (comp.  §  47). 

The  salts  of  paralactic  acid  resemble  those  of  fermentation  lactic 
acid,  but  are  distinguished  therefrom  by  differences  in  the  amount  of 
water  of  crystallisation  and  somewhat  different  solubilities.  These 
differences  are  especially  noticeable  in  the  zinc  salts.  Zincic  paralactate 
contains  only  two  molecules  of  water  of  crystallisation  : 

(C3H503)2Zn,2H20, 

and  on  slow  evaporation  crystallises  in  single  short  and  thick  but 
small  prisms.  It  is  scarcely  soluble  in  alcohol,  dissolves  in  18'5  parts 
of  water  at  14°— 15°,  and  readily  yields  supersaturated  solutions,  which 
only  arrive  slowly  at  their  normal  concentration.  Its  solution — as 
those  of  all  other  paralactates — rotates  the  plane  of  polarisation  to 
the  left. 

Further  derivatives  of  paralactic  acid  have  not  yet  been  prepared. 

3.  Ethylene  Lactic  Acid. 

743.  Ethylene  lactic  acid  can  be  prepared  synthetically  from  its 
nitrile.  This,  ethylene  hydrate  cyanide,  is  obtained  by  heating  ethylene 
hydrate  chloride  with  an  alcoholic  solution  of  potassic  cyanide  : 

H0.CH2.CH2.C1  +  KCN  =  HO.CH2.CH2.CN  +  KC1. 

After  evaporation  of  the  solution  filtered  from  the  potassic  chloride 
the  residue  is  extracted  with  a  mixture  of  equal  volumes  of  absolute 
alcohol  and  ether,  which  dissolves  the  nitrile  and  leaves  it  on  evapora- 
tion as  a  yellowish  syrup.  On  boiling  with  alkalies  it  is  converted 
with  evolution  of  ammonia  into  potassic  ethylene  lactate  : 

HO.CH2.CH2.CN  +  H20  +  HOK  =  NH3 
+  HO.CH2.CH2.CO.OK. 

This  salt  is  decomposed  by  an  excess  of  dilute  sulphuric  acid,  and  the 
free  acid  extracted  with  ether.  It  contains  as  a  rule  a  slight  ad- 
mixture of  fermentation  lactic  acid,  from  which  it  can  be  purified, 
though  with  difficulty,  by  conversion  into  the  zinc  salt,  &c. 

The  same  acid  apparently  occurs,  together  with  paralactic  acid,  in 
extract  of  meat,  and  is  found  in  the  alcoholic  solution  filtered  from  the 
zincic  paralactate;  this  yields  on  evaporation  a  syrup  in  which 
numerous  crystals  of  zincic  paralactate  are  embedded.  Its  preparation 
in  a  state  of  approximate  purity  is  attended  with  great  difficulties,  and 
can  only  be  effected  by  repeated  treatment  with  very  strong  alcohol 

F  F 


434   DERIVATIVES   OF   THE  ALCOHOL   ACID   RADICALS,   CnH2n_2. 

and  final  precipitation  of  a  part  of  the  salt  with  ether,  until  the  zinc 
salt  remaining  dissolved  is  obtained  completely  amorphous  on  evapora- 
tion.    The  free  acid  is  then  liberated  by  hydric  sulphide. 

Ethylene  lactic  acid  forms  a  syrup,  closely  resembling  ethylidene 
lactic  acid.  Its  alkali  salts  are  very  soluble;  the  sodic  salt  yields,  on 
complete  evaporation  on  the  water  bath,  a  solid  crystalline  mas-, 
soluble  in  alcohol  and  crystallising  from  the  boiling  alcoholic  solution 
in  indistinct  forms. 

Zincic  ethylene  lactate  is  completely  amorphous ;  it  is  somewhat 
decomposed  at  100°,  becoming  yellow-coloured,  so  that  it  can  only  be 
completely  dried  in  vacuo.  It  gives  at  first  a  transparent  gummy 
mass,  which  becomes  turbid  on  complete  drying.  Its  composition  is 
then  (C3H503)2Zn. 

By  oxidation  with  nitric  acid  or  with  chromic  and  sulphuric  acids 
it  yields  no  acetic  acid,  but  carbonic  anhydride  and  oxalic  acids.  A 
mixture  of  paralactic  and  ethylene  lactic  acids,  such  as  is  obtained  from 
extract  of  meat,  on  the  other  hand,  yields  malonic  acid,  which  can  only 
be  formed  from  the  ethylene  lactic  acid  : 

HO.CH2.CH2.CO.OH  +  20  =  H20  +  HO.CO.CH2.CO.OH. 

(Malonic  acid.) 

By  heating  with  hydriodic  acid  it  does  not  yield  crystalline  iodo-pro- 
pionic  acid. 

4.  Hydr  acrylic  Acid. 

744.  If  glyceric  acid,  obtained  by  the  oxidation  of  glycerine,  be 
heated  in  syrupy  solution  with  phosphorus  iodide,  a  violent  reaction 
occurs  with  evolution  of  hydriodic  acid,  and  on  cooling  the  mass 
solidifies  to  a  crystalline  pulp  of  fi-iodo-propionic  acid  : 

C3H604  +  3HI  =  I2  +  2H20  +  C3H,I02. 

The  same  body  is  obtained  by  heating  acrylic  acid  and  a  solution  of 
hydriodic  acid  at  1 20°  : 

C3H402  +  HI  =  C3H5I02. 

It  crystallises  in  large,  colourless,  brilliant  plates,  which  melt  at  82° 
and  are  difficultly  soluble  in  cold,  readily  in  hot,  water.  By  heating 
with  concentrated  hydriodic  acid  to  at  least  180°  it  is  converted  into 
propionic  acid. 

By  treatment  with  chlorine  water  iodine  is  eliminated  and  ft-chlor- 
propionic  acid  formed  : 

2C3H5I02  +  Cl2  =  I,  +  2C3H5C102, 

which  forms  leafy  crystals  melting  at  405°,  and  which  can  also  be 
prepared  by  combining  acrylic  and  hydrochloric  acids. 

fi-Brom-propionic  acid  can  be  prepared  in  exactly  analogous  manner 
to  the  last ;  it  forms  crystals  melting  at  61 '5°. 

745.  On  adding  freshly  precipitated  argentic  oxide  to  a  hot  solution 
of  /3-iodo-propionic  acid,  as  long  as  argentic  iodide  separates,  hydra- 
crylic  acid  is  formed  : 

C3H5I02  +  AgOH  =  Agl  +  C3H,(OH)02. 
The  liquid  is  treated  with  sulphuretted  hydrogen  to  remove  excess  of 


LACTIC  ACIDS.  435 

silver,  and  the  nitrate  saturated  when  hot  with  zincic  carbonate.  By 
.slow  evaporation  zincic  hydracrylate  is  obtained  in  beautiful  prisms, 
from  which  pure  hydracrylic  acid  can  be  separated  by  hydric  sulphide. 
Hydracrylic  acid  is  syrupy,  like  the  other  lactic  acids,  does  not 
yield  ethereal  anhydrides  on  heating  or  acetic  aldehyde  on  dry  distil- 
lation, but  is  converted  into  water  and  acrylic  acid  : 

C3H603  =  H20  +  C3H402. 

By  careful  oxidation  with  chromic  acid  or  nitric  acid  it  is  con- 
verted into  carbonic  anhydride  and  glycollic  acid,  the  latter  being 
readily  further  oxidised  to  oxalic  acid. 

The  constitution  of  hydracrylic  acid  is  not  yet  sufficiently  clear, 
but  the  results  of  oxidation  and  other  considerations  render  probable 
the  formula  : 

CH2.OH 

I 
H.C 

l/° 
H.CT   OH 

By  heating  with  hydriodic  acid  it  is  readily  reconverted  into  /3-iodo- 
propionic  acid  : 

C3H603  +  HI  =  H,0  +  C3H5I02. 

The  salts  of  hydracrylic  acid  differ  very  essentially  from  those  of 
all  the  isomeric  acids. 

The  sodic  salL  separates  from  boiling  nearly  absolute  alcohol  in 
colourless  anhydrous  crystals  of  the  formula  C5ir503Na,  melting  at 
143°. 

Calcic  hydracrylate,  (C3H503)2Ca,2H20,  crystallises  in  rhombic 
prisms,  which  readily  part  with  their  water  of  crystallisation. 

Zincic  hydracrylate,  (C3H503)2Zn,4H20,  crystallises  in  large  well- 
formed  triclinic  prisms,  and  is  soluble  in  somewhat  less  than  its  own 
weight  of  cold  water.  On  mixing  solutions  of  equal  molecules  of  the 
zincic  and  calcic  salts,  crystalline  crusts  of  the  difficultly  soluble  double 
salt,  (C3H503)2Zn,(C3H503)2Ca,  separate.  All  salts  of  hydracrylic 
acid  lose  water  when  heated  to  180°-200°,  and  are  converted  into  a 
mixture  of  salts  of  acrylic  acid,  C3H402,  and  diacrylic  acid,  C6H804. 

746.  If  /3-iodo-propionic  acid  be  heated  with  ammonia  solution,  it 
yields  fi-amido-propionic  acid,  C3H5(NH2)03  (or  doubled),  isomeric 
with  alanine,  which  crystallises  in  colourless  monoclinic  prisms.  It 
is  readily  soluble  in  water,  difficultly  in  alcohol,  sublimes  at  170°  on 
careful  heating,  and  carbonises  at  higher  temperatures. 

Ilydroxy-butyric  Acids,  C4H803. 

747.  Four  isomeric  bodies  of  this  formula  have  been  obtained. 

1 .  a-Hydroxy-butyric  Acid. — On  heating  butyric  acid  for  some  time 
with  a  molecule  of  bromine  to  120°-130°  in  sealed  glass  tubes,  there 
is  formed  principally  a-brom-butyric  acid,  CH3.CH2.CHBr.CO.OH,  as 
a  non-crystallisable  oily  liquid,  which  boils  at  217°  with  partial 
decomposition,  and  yields  an  ethylic  salt  boiling  at  172°.  On  heating 
the  solutions  of  its  alkaline  salts,  they  are  decomposed  into  metallic 
bromide  and  a-hydroxy-butyric  acid,  CH3.CH2.CH(OH).CO.OH,  which

• 

is  purified  by  conversion  into  the  zinc  salt,  very  difficultly  soluble  in 
cold  water,  and  the  free  acid  separated  therefrom  in  the  usual  manner. 
It  crystallises  in  starlike  groups  of  needles  or  prisms,  melts  at 
43°_44°5  and  deliquesces  in  air.  At  higher  temperatures  it  loses 
water  and  is  converted  into  its  ethereal  anhydrides.  Its  zinc  salt  has 
the  formula  (C4H703)2Zn,2H20. 

By  decomposition  of  a-brom-butyric  acid  with  ammonia  it  yields 
CH3.CH2.CH.NH2 
amido-butyric  acid,  |\  ,   corresponding  to    glycocine 

CO.O  H 
and  alanine,  which  crystallises  in  small  needles  and  leafy  crystals. 

2.  fj-Hydroxy-butyric  acid,  CH3.CH(OH).CH2.CO.OH,  is  formed 
by  oxidation  of  its  aldehyde,  aldol  (§  656).  It  is  prepared  syntheti- 
cally from  propylene  hydrate  chloride  (§  496)  by  heating  with  potassic 
cyanide  and  boiling  the  resulting  solution  of  propylene  hydrate 
cyanide,  CH3.CH(OH).CH2.CN,  with  potassic  hydrate. 

It  is  most  readily  obtained  by  the  action  of  water  and  sodium 
amalgam  on  ethylic  aceto-acetate  : 

CH3.CO.CH2.CO.OC2H,  +  Na,  +  2H20 
=  CH3.CH(OH).CH2.CO.ONa  +  NaOH  +  HO.C2H5. 

Its  sodic  salt  crystallises  from  nearly  absolute  alcohol  in  fine  prisms, 
which  deliquesce  in  air.  The  calcic,  zincic,  and  plumbic  salts  are 
amorphous,  very  soluble  in  water  and  also  in  alcohol. 

At  higher  temperatures  it  decomposes  into  water  and  a-crotonic 
acid  : 

CH3.CH(OH).CH2.CO.OH  =  CH3.CH  :  CH.CO.OH  +  H20. 

3.  y-Hydroxy-butyric  acid,  CH2(OH).CH2.CH2.CO.OH,  obtained 
by  action  of  baric  hydrate  on  succinic  aldehyde;  it  yields  succinic 
add  on  oxidation. 

4.  a-Hydroxy-isobutyric  «ci<t,  (CH3)2 :  C(OH).OO.OH,  also  termed 
butyl  lactic  acid,  dimeth-oxaUc  acid,  or  acetonic  acid,  is  prepared  by 
several  methods. 

lsobutyric  acid  is  converted  into  a-brom-isobutyric  acid  by  heating 
to  140°  with  bromine.  This  is  crystalline,  melts  at  45°,  and  decom- 
poses on  distillation.  When  mixed  with  a  small  quantity  of  water  it 
becomes  oily,  probably  from  formation  of  the  trihydrate  : 

(CH3)2CBr.C(OH)3, 

but  again  solidifies  after  some  time  in  a  dry  vacuum  ;  it  is  but  little 
soluble  in  cold  water.  By  boiling  with  alkalies  it  is  converted  into 
o-oxyisobutyric  acid. 

As  dimeth-oxalic  acid  this  latter  is  obtained  by  heating  oxalic  acid 
with  methylic  iodide  and  zinc  (§  705,  8),  as  acetonic  acid  from  acetone, 
hydrocyanic  and  hydrochloric  acids  (§  705,  6),  as  butyl  lactic  acid  by 
oxidation  of  isoamylene  glycol  with  nitric  acid. 

ri-Hydroxy-isobutyric  acid  crystallises  in  colourless  soluble  prisms, 
which  melt  at  79°  and  sublime  even  at  50°  in  needles.  It  evaporates 
so  readily  in  aqueous  vapour  that  nothing  is  left  on  evaporation  of 
an  aqueous  solution.  By  gentle  oxidation  it  is  first  converted  into 
acetone  and  carbonic  anhydride.     Its  salts  are  all  crystalline,  and  its 


HYDROXY-BUTYRIC  ACIDS.  437 

zinc  salt,  like  those  of  all  «-oxy-acids,  is  very  difficultly  soluble  in 
cold  water. 

748.  Nitrile  and  urea  derivatives  of  a-hydroxy-isol>utyric  acid  can 
be  prepared  from  acetone. 

The  latter  unites  directly  with  anhydrous  hydrocyanic  acid  to  form 
the  liquid  nitrile,  (CH3)2 :0(OH).CN,  which  on  distillation  is  re- 
solved into  its  components,  similarly  to  ethylidene  hydrate  cyanide 
(§  712). 

If  acetone  be  mixed  with  finely  powdered  potassic  cyanide,  and 
hydrochloric  acid  added  slowly  until  all  the  latter  is  decomposed,  the 
nascent  elements  of  a  molecule  of  hydrocyanic  acid  unite  with  two 
molecules  of  acetone,  yielding  diacetone-cyanhydrin  :

This  latter  crystallises  in  beautiful  brilliant  prisms,  which  sublime 
readily,  melt  above  130°,  and  are  resolved  by  strong  acids  into  am- 
monia, acetone,  and  a-oxyisobutyric  acid  :

A  mixture  of  acetone  with  potassic  cyanide  and  isocyanate  yields,

Hydroxy-valeric  Acids,  C5H10O3. 

749.  Only  three  of  the  numerous  theoretically  possible  oxyvaleric 
acids  are  known. 

1.  a-Hydro.ry-isovaleric  acid,  (CH3)2  :  CH.CH(OH).CO.OH,  is 
formed  from  a-brom-isovaleric  acid,  (CH3)2  :  CH.CHBr.CO.OH  (ob- 
tained by  heating  isovaleric  acid  with  bromine),  by  boiling  with  moist 
argentic  oxide.  It  crystallises  in  large  colourless  tables,  melting  at 
80°  and  slowly  subliming  below  100°,  which  dissolve  readily  in  water, 
alcohol,  and  ether.  A  mixture  of  chromic  and  sulphuric  acids  oxidises 
it  to  isobutyric  acid,  carbonic  anhydride,  and  water.  By  boiling 
ammonic  a-brom-isovalerate  with  ammonia,  a-amido-isovaleric  acid*

CO.O  H 
leaves,  somewhat  sublimable.  It  behaves  towards  acids  and  bases  in 
similar  manner  to  alanine,  glycocine,  &c.  Apparently  the  same  body 
has  been  prepared,  under  the  name  of  butalanine,  from  the  spleen  and 
pancreas  gland  of  oxen. 

2.  Eth-meth-oxalic  acid,  CH3  ^2>C(OH).CO.OH,  the  a-hydroxy 

substitution  product  of  eth-meth-acetic  acid,  is  obtained  by  heating 
together  a  mixture  of  ethylic  oxalate,  ethylic  iodide,  and  methylic 
iodide  with  zinc,  in  the  form  of  its  ethylic  salt  (boiling  point  165°). 
This,  on  saponification  with  alkalies,  decomposition  of  the  Bait  with 
sulphuric  acid,  and  extraction  with  ether,  yields  the  free  acid  in  readily 
soluble  crystals,  melting  at  63°. 

3.  ^-Hydroxy  a-methyl  butyric  acid  : 

CH3.CH(OH).CH(CH3).CO.OH. 

The  sodic  salt  of  this  acid  is  obtained  by  the  action  of  sodium  amal-

which  is  converted  into  the  oxyacid  by  treatment  with  nitrous  acid. 
The  oxyacid  crystallises  in  colourless  needles,  readily  soluble  and 
melting  at  73°.     Its  salts  are  mostly  difficultly  soluble. 

A  body  of  great  physiological  importance,  known  :is  leucine  and 
obtained  as  a  decomposition  product  of  albuminoid  bodies,  is  probably 
identical  with  u-amido-caproic  acid.  It  is  obtained  from  nearly  all 
proteoids  and  from  gelatine  (in  the  latter  case  together  with  glycocine) 
by  putrefaction,  by  action  of  pancreas  ferment,  and  by  boiling  with 
alkalies  and  strong  acids;  it  occurs  in  small  quantity  in  some  animal 


HYDROXY-CAPROIC  ACIDS.  439 

From  the  true  albuminoids,  as  also  from  horn  and  elastine,  leucine 
is  invariably  obtained,  together  with  the  more  difficultly  soluble,  and 
therefore  readily  separable,  tyrosine.  Elastiue  gives  the  greatest 
yield.  The  dried  cervical  ligament  of  the  ox,  reduced  to  the  finest 
possible  state  of  division,  is  placed  in  a  hot  mixture  of  two  parts  sul- 
phuric acid  and  three  parts  water,  and  heated  for  several  hours  in  a 
vessel  provided  with  an  inverted  condenser.  So  much  milk  of  lime  is 
thin  added  that  the  sulphuric  acid  is  exactly  neutralised,  and,  after 
dilution  with  six  times  its  volume  of  water,  the  mixture  is  filtered. 
The  filtrate  is  mixed  with  some  more  milk  of  lime,  boiled  for  several 
hours,  and  the  hot  filtered  liquid  neutralised  with  sulphuric  acid.  The 
clear  liquid,  separated  from  the  calcic  sulphate,  is  then  evaporated  to 
a  thin  syrup,  and  the  mixture  of  tyrosine  and  leucine  separated  by 
crystallisation  from  water. 

Leucine  crystallises  in  white  nacreous  leaves,  of  fatty  feeling, 
soluble  in  27  parts  of  cold  water  and  in  1,040  parts  of  cold  alcohol. 
It  melts  at  170°,  and  sublimes  in  part  unchanged.  On  stronger  heat- 
ing it  decomposes  into  carbonic  anhydride  and  amvlamine. 

Leucic  acul,  prepared  from  leucine  by  action  of  nitrous  acid,  so 
closely  resembles  a-oxycaproic  acid  that  they  are  held  to  be  identical.

Acetylene  is  the  only  hydrocarbon  that  can  be  prepared  directly 
from  its  free  elements,  this  occurring  when  the  electric  arc  passes 
between  carbon  poles  in  an  atmosphere  of  hydrogen.  It  is  formed 
from  nearly  all  organic  compounds  at  a  strong  red  heat,  and  therefore 
ocelli's  regularly  in  coal  gas.  It  can  be  obtained  from  this  latter  in 
considerably  larger  quantity  by  incomplete  combustion,  whether  this

ACETYLENE.  441 

Calcic  and  potassic  carbides  (bye  product  of  the  preparation  of 
potassium),  when  heated  with  water,  evolve  acetylene. 

The  richest  yield  is  obtained  by  passing  the  vapour  of  brom-ethy- 
lene  (§  649)  into  hot  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  :

It  is  also  obtained  by  the  action  of  the  ■  zinc  copper  couple  '  on 
chloroform,  bromoform,  and  iodoform,  or  by  the  action  of  zinc  on 
ehloral  hydrate. 

Acetylene  is  a  colourless  gas,  liquefiable  at  a  pressure  of  83 
atm<>  it  18°,  of  strongly  disagreeable  odour,  and  which  burns 

with  a  Vfi  v  luminous  flame. 

Extremely  characteristic  for  acetylene,  as  for  aU  hydrocarbons 
which  contain  the  triply  united  terminal  group  ;CH,  is  the  replace- 
ability  of  the  hydrogen  atom  by  certain  metals.     On  passing  acetylene 

over  heated  alkali  metals,  hydrogen  is  evolved,  and  voluminous 
colourless  compounds  are  formed,  e.g.  CH  |  CNa  and  liich 

are  violently  decomposed  by  water  into  alkaline  hydrate  and  acetylene. 

Tin-  replacement  is  effected  still  more  readily  by  silver  or  copper.

On  heating  the  antimonic  chloride  compound  with  excess  of  anti-

boiling  at  147°  : 

CHCl:CHSbCl4  +  SbCl5  =  2Sb.Cl3  4-  CHC12.CHC12. 

Acetylene  dichloride  is  a  colourless  liquid,  which  boils  at  55°,  on 
heating  its  vapour  to  360°  decomposes  into  hydrochloric  acid  and 
carbon  : 

C2H2C12  =  2HC1  +  C2, 

and  on  heating  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  yields  potassic  chloride 
and  acetate : 

C2H2C12  +  3KOH  =  2KC1  +  C2H3O.OK  +  H20. 

Notwithstanding  the  different  boiling  points  assigned  to  these  com- 
pounds, acetylene  dichloride  and  tetrachloride  appear  to  be  identical 
with  dichlor  ethylene  and  dichlor  ethylene  dichloride  (§  473),  the 
lower  boiling  points  of  these  latter  being  due  to  their  not  being  com- 
pletely pure. 

These  chlorides  cannot  be  prepared  by  the  direct  action  of  chlorine 
on  acetylene,  as  explosion  with  separation  of  carbon  ensues  on  mixing 
the  two  gases. 

Acetylene  is  absorbed  by  cold  bromine,  and  yields  the  liquid  com- 
pounds acetylene  dibromide,  CHBr :  CHBr,  and  acetylene  tetrabromide/ 
CHBr2.CHBr2. 

It  unites  with  iodine  at  100°,  forming  the  crystalline  acetylene 
diiodide  CHI :  CHI,  which  melts  at  about  70°. 

It  also  unites  directly  with  hydrobromic  and  hydriodic  acids.  The

This  is  formed,  together  with  glycollic  acid  and  glyoxalic  acid,  by  the 
moderated  oxidation  of  ethylene  glycol  and  ethylic  alcohol  with  nitric

instead  of  evaporating  the  contents  of  the  cylinder  in  small  portions 
(whereby  the  glyoxal  is  further  oxidised  by  still  unchanged  nitric  acid 
into  glyoxalic  and  oxalic  acids),  the  whole  oxidation  product  is  heated 
for  some  hours  in  a  vessel  provided  with  an  inverted  condenser, 
whereby  the  nitric  acid  is  destroyed  by  the  ethylic  alcohol  and  acetic 
aldehyde  present.  After  neutralising  with  chalk,  and  separating  the 
salts  with  alcohol,  the  alcoholic  filtrate  is  evaporated  on  the  water 
bath  to  a  thick  syrup,  and  again  treated  with  absolute  alcohol,

is  diluted  with  benzene,  in  order  to  moderate  the  violence  of  the 
reaction  : 

CHo.COCl  CH2.CO.C2H5

CH2.COCl  CH2.CO.C2H5 

It  is  a  faint  yellow,  mobile,  oily  liquid,  heavier  than  water.

758.  To  this  group  belong  some  hydrocarbons,  Cn.H2n  +  ^C  j  H, 
homologous  with  acetylene,  and  their  derivatives. 

Allylene,  CH3.C :  CH. 

759.  Allylene  is  prepared  (analogously  to  the  preparation  of 
acetylene  from  the  halogen  substitution  products  of  ethylene)  by  the 
action  of  an  alcoholic  solution  of  sodic  ethylate  on  chlor-  and  brom- 
propylene  (§  658) : 

CH3.CCI :  CH2  +  NaOC2H5  =  NaCl  +  HO.C2H5  +  CH3.C  \  CH, 

and  by  the  decomposition  of  its  tetrachloride,  dichlor-acetone  chloride, 
with  sodium : 

CH3.CC12.CHC12  +  2Na,  =  4NaCl  +  CH3.C  j  CH. 

It  is  a  colourless  gas  which  gives  precipitates  in  ammoniacal 
solutions  of  cuprous  and  argentic  compounds,  of  similar  constitution 
to  the  acetylene  compounds.  The  cuprous  precipitate  is  siskin  green, 
and  silver  compound  white  crystalline  and  has  the  formula  : 

(C3H4)2Ag2  : 

Ag.NH3Cl  CH3.C :  C.Ag 

2CH,.C:CH+    |  =  2NH4C1  +  | 

Ag.NH3Cl  CH3.C;C.Ag 

When  treated  with  acids  allylene  is  evolved. 

Allylene  yields  two  colourless  oily  compounds  with  bromine, 
allylene  dibromide,  CH3.CBr  :  CHBr,  boiling  at  130°-131°,  and  of 
sp.  gr.  2*05,  and  allylene  tetrabromide,  CH3.CBr2.CHBr2,  of  sp.  gr. 
2'94,  which  cannot  be  distilled  unchanged.  Allylene  combines  slowly 
with  iodine,  forming  allylene  diiodide,  CH3.CT.CHI,  a  liquid  boiling  at 
198°. 

Hydrochloric  and  hydrobromic  acid  are  absorbed  directly  by 
allylene  with  formation  of  dihaloids  of  the  acetone  radical.  Hydro- 
chloric acid  yields  dimethyl  carbin-dichloiide  (§  445)  : 

CH3.C  jCH  +  2HC1  =  CH3.CC12.CH3, 

hydrobromic  acid  giving,  in  addition  to  the  corresponding  dimethyl 
carbin-di bromide,  CH3.CBr.CH3,  also  propenyl  bromide  : 

CH3.C  ;  CH  +  HBr  =  CH,.CH.CHBr, 

boiling  at  48°  and  isomeric  with  brom-propylene. 

With  hydriodic  acid   it  forms  an  oil    isomeric    with    propylene 


446   DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  KETONE  ALDEHYDE  RADICALS,  CnH,n_  2. 

diiodide,  which  has  at  0°  sp.  gr.  2 "44,  and  boils  with  decomposition  at 
I47°_148°.     It  is  probably  dimethyl  carbin-diiodide,  CH3.CI2.CH3. 

Allylene  dichloride,  CH3.CC1 :  CHC1,  has  not  yet  been  prepared 
from  allylene,  but  is  obtained,  together  with  the  isomeric  dichlor-glycid, 
by  action  of  potassic  hydrate  on  methyl  chlor-acetol : 

CH3.CC12.CH2C1  +  KOH  =  KC1  +  H20  +  CH3.0C1 :  CHCL 

It  is  a  liquid  boiling  at  75°. 

760.  The  dihalogenised  acetones  obtained  by  direct  substitution 
from  acetone  may  be  considered  amongst  the  allylene  derivatives. 

Unsymmetrical  dichlor-acetone,  CH3.C0.CHC12,  obtained  by  action 
of  chlorine  on  acetone,  is  a  liquid  boiling  at  120°  and  of  sp.  gr.  1*236. 
Phosphoric  chloride  converts  it  into  the  so-called  dicldor-acetone 
chloride  : 

CH3.C0.CHC12  +  PC15  =  POCl3  +  CH3.CC12.CHC12, 

which  is  without  doubt  allylene  tetrachloride.  It  boils  at  153°  and 
lias  sp.  gr.  1-47  at  13°. 

761.  Propyl  acetylene,  C5H8=CH3.CH2.CH2.C  j  CH,  is  the  only 
one  of  the  numerous  hydrocarbons  of  the  formula  CnH2n  _  2  truly  homo- 
logous with  allylene.  It  is  obtained  by  the  action  of  alcoholic  potassic 
hydrate  upon  the  dichloride  of  the  methyl-propyl  ketone  radical : 

CH3.CH2.CH2.CC12.CH3  +  2KOH  =  2KC1  +  2H20 
+  CH3.CH2.CH2.C ;  CH. 

It  is  a  liquid  boiling  at  50°,  which  gives  a  yellow  precipitate  in  an 
ammoniacal  solution  of  cuprous  chloride  and  a  white  precipitate  with 
the  corresponding  silver  compound. 

Derivatives  of  the  Aldehyde  Double  Alcohol  Radicals, 

CnH2n_  2- 

762.  Of  this  group  scarcely  anything  is  known  but  unsaturated 
compounds ;  namely,  the  aldehydes  of  the  unsaturated  alcohols 
CnH2n_1OH.  The  first  member  of  the  group  is  acrolein,  the  aldehyde 
of  allylic  alcohol ;  but,  as  it  differs  greatly  in  its  chemical  behaviour 
from  the  true  aldehydes  containing  the  group  CH  :  O,  it  is  doubtful 
whether  the  formula  CH2  :CH.CH  :  0  should  be  assigned  to  it,  or  if 
its  properties  do  not  correspond  better  with  the  expression  : 

CH9:C

Its  relations  to  hydracrylic  and  glyceric  acids  agree  with  the  latter 
formula,  but  as  the  question  is  still  unsettled  it  will  be  viewed  here 
as  a  true  aldehyde. 

Acrolein,  C3H40  =  CH2  :  CH.CH  :  O. 

763.  Acrolein  is  formed  by  the  careful  oxidation  of  allylic  alcohol, 
by  the  dry  distillation  of  glycerin  and  its  salts  (the  fats),  and  by  the 
action  of  bromine  on  acetone. 


ACROLEIN.  447 

To  prepare  it  one  part  of  anhydrous  glycerine  is  mixed  with  two 
parts  of  hydric  potaasic  sulphate  and  the  mixture  submitted  to  dry 
distillation.     The  decomposition  proceeds  according  to  the  equation  : 

CH.,.OH  CH2 

!    "  II 

CH.OH    =  2H20  +  CH 

I  I 

CH2.OH  CH :  0 

The  distillate  is  then  carefully  mixed  with  calcic  chloride,  some 
plumbic  oxide  added  to  remove  any  admixed  sulphurous  acid,  and 
then  rectified  on  the  water  bath. 

Acrolein  is  a  thin  colourless  liquid,  boiling  at  52°,  of  most  irritating 
odour.  It  is  lighter  than  water  and  requires  about  forty  parts  of  the 
latter  for  solution.  It  mixes  with  alcohol  and  ether  in  every  propor- 
tion. On  keeping  it  is  transformed  into  a  white  amorphous  substance, 
/•///,  a  polymer  of  unknown  molecular  weight  and  structure,  from 
which  acrolein  cannot  be  regained. 

It  does  not  yield  a  crystalline  compound  with  acid  alkali  sulphites. 
Nascent  hydrogen  converts  it  into  allvlic  alcohol,  alkalies  resinit'v  it, 
argentic  oxide  oxidises  it  to  acrylic  acid. 

On  passing  hydrochloric  acid  into  acrolein,  an  oil  is  obtained 
solidifying  in  needles,  C3H4O.H('l,  which  on  distillation  alone  is 
resolved  into  its  components,  but  with  potas>ic  hydrate  yields  meta- 
crolefn. 

Metacrolein,     probably     C^ELifi^  =  3C3H40,    forms    colourless 
crystals  insoluble  in  water,  melting  as  50°  and  boiling  ;it  170°. 
somewhat  higher  temperature  (in  part  also  during  distillation)  the 
vapours  dissociate  into  acrolein. 

Phosphoric  chloride  reacts  with  acrolein  according  to  the  equation  : 

C3H40  +  PC15  =  POCl3  +  C3H4C12. 

The  resulting  dichloride  is  a  mixture  of  two  isomeric  liquid  com- 
pounds, of  which  one,  termed  acrol  chloride,  boils  at  84°,  and  probably 
his  the  formula  CH0  :  CH.CHC12,  whilst  the  other  is  dichlor  glycid 
(§  767). 

Acrolein  unites  directly  with  two  atoms  of  chlorine  or  bromine. 
Nitric  acid  converts  the  dibromide,  C3H4Br20,  into  a  polymeric  com- 
pound, which  crystallises  in  prisms  or  leaves  and  melts  at  59°. 

Acrolein  and  ammonia  react  in  alcoholic  solution  to  form  a  brown 
or  yellow  amorphous  compound,  acrolein  ammonia,  which,  however, 
does  not  correspond  to  the  alkylidene  hydrate  amides,  but  is  homo- 
logous with  oxytetraldine  (§  424)  : 

2C3H40  +  NH3  =  H20  +  C6H9NO. 

It  forms  amorphous  salts  with  acids,  and  decomposes  into  picoline  and 
water  on  dry  distillation. 

764.  Isodichlor  glycid,  or  p-chlor-allyl  chloride,  CH2C1.CH  :CHC1, 
isomeric  with  allylene  dichloride  and  acrol  chloride,  is  formed,  together 
with  dichlor  glycid,  when  glyceryl  trichloride  is  decomposed  by 
alkalies,  as  a  colourless  liquid,  boiling  at  109°.     It  is  formed  in  larger 


448 

quantity  by  heating  dichlor-hydrin   (§   679)  with  phosphoric  anhy- 
dride : 

CH2C1.CH(0H).CH2C1  +  P205  =  2HP03  +  CH2C1.CH  :  CHC1. 

It  combines  directly  with  chlorine,  forming  CH2C1.CHC1.CHC12. 

a-Crotonic  Aldehyde,  C4H60  =  CH3.CH  :  CH.CHO. 

765.  a-Crotonic  aldehyde,  also  known  as  crotonic  aldehyde,  is 
obtained  from  acetic  aldehyde  by  long  heating  at  100°  with  a  con- 
centrated solution  of  potassic  acetate,  or  with  zincic  chloride  and  a 
little  water  : 

2CH3.CHO  =  H20  +  CH3.CH  :  CH.CHO, 

and  from  aldol  (§  656)  by  distillation  : 

CH3.CH(OH).CH2.CHO  =  H20  +  CH3.CH  :  CH.CHO. 

Crotonic  aldehyde  is  a  mobile,  colourless  liquid,  which  after  mo- 
mentary fruity  odour  acts  on  the  eyes  and  nose  like  acrolein.  It  boils 
at  104°-105°,  is  somewhat  soluble  in  water,  and  by  oxidation  (slowly 
in  air,  rapidly  by  argentic  oxide)  is  converted  into  a-crotonic  acid. 
With  phosphoric  pentachloride  it  yields  crotonal  dichloride  : 

CH3.CH  :  CH.CHC12, 

an  oil  boiling  at  125°-127°,  and  unites  directly  with  hydrochloric  acid, 
forming  chlor-butyric  aldehyde  : 

CH3.CH  :  CH.CHO  +  HC1  =  CH3.CH2.CHC1.CH0.

Isallylene,  CH2 :  C  :  CH2,  and  Glycid  Compounds. 

766.  Isallylene,  a  gaseous  hydro-carbon  isomeric  with  allylene, 
and  to  which  the  formula  CH2  :  C  :  CH2  has  been  assigned,  is  only 
prepared  by  the  electrolysis  of  potassic  itaconate.  It  gives  no  precipi- 
tate with  ammoniacal  solutions  of  silver  salts  ;  it  combines  directly 
with  bromine  to  form  crystalline  isallylene  tetrabromide  : 

CH2Br.CBr2.CH2Br. 

Its  direct  relation  to  the  following  glycid  compounds,  though  not  yet 
shown  directly,  is  still  scarcely  doubtful. 

Glycid  Compounds  or  Derivatives  of  a-substituted  Allyl. 

767.  On  bringing  together  glyceryl  trichloride  with  powdered 
potassic  hydrate,  an  energetic  reaction  ensues,  in  which  a  hydrogen 
and  a  chlorine  atom  are  removed,  and  there  is  formed 

Dichlor  glycid,  CH2  :  CC1.CH2C1,  or  a-chlor-allyl  chloride,  probably 
the  dichloride  of  isallylene,  isomeric  with  allylene  dichloride,  isodi- 
chlor  glycid,  and  acrol  chloride.  It  is  a  mobile  liquid  of  agreeable 
ethereal  odour,  which  boils  at  94°  and  combines  with  a  molecule  of 
chlorine,  forming  dichlor-glycid  dichloride,  CH2C1.CC12.CH2C1,  of 
boiling  point  164°.  It  also  unites  with  a  molecule  of  bromine,  forming

dichlor-glycid  dibromide,  CH2Br.CClBr.CH2Cl,  a  liquid  of  sp.  gr.  2*1 
and  boiling  point  221°. 

By  heating  with  six  times  its  volume  of  sulphuric  acid,  and 
distillation  of  the  product  with  water,  it  is  converted  into  mono- 
chlor-acetone  (§  660).  The  process  may  be  represented  by  the  equa- 
tions : 

CH2 :  CC1.CH2C1  +  HO.S02.OH  =  CH3.CC1(0.S02.0H).CH2C1 

ami 

CH3.CC1(0.S02.0H).CH2C1  +  H20  =  H2S04  +  HC1

from  glyceryl  tribromide  and  potassic  hydrate,  boils  at  151°-152°. 

768.  When  dibrom-glycid  is  heated  with  the  salts  of  monobasic 
acids,  it  exchanges  only  one  bromine  atom — the  terminal  one — for  the 
acid  radical,  and  yields  a-brom-allylic  salts  : 

CH2  :  CBr.CH,Br  +  AgO.NO,  =  AgBr  +  CH2  :  CBr.CH2.O.N02. 

a-Brom-allylic  nitrate,  boils 
between  140°  and  1503.

from  which  alkalies  liberate  a-brom-aU 'ylic  alcohol,  CH2 :  CBr.CH2.OH, 

as  a  colourless,  mobile  liquid  of  agreeable  odour,  sp.  gr.  16  at  15°  and 
boiling  at  155°. 

Phosphoric  chloride  converts  the  alcohol  into  a-brom-allylic  chloride, 
or  thlor-bromglycid,  CHj  :  <  T»r.<  1 1  J  1,  which  boils  at  120°,  and  is  also 
formed  by  the  action  of  alkalies  on  glyceryl  dichloro-bromide  : 

CH2Cl.CllBr.01i2Cl  (§  6>: 

Glyceryl  dibromo-ethylate  (§  685),  prepared  from  allyl-ethyl  ether 
and  bromine,  is  similarly  converted  by  alkalies  into  a-bromallyl-ethyl

Dibrom-glycid  also  reacts  with  potassic  sulphocyanate,  forming 
u-brom-allyl  suljdiocyanate(Qom\).§  671), CH2  :  CBr.CH2.N:CS,  which 
distils  at  about  200°,  and  with  ammonia  yields  a-brom-allyl  sulphurea, 
CH2  :CBr.CH2.NH.CS.NH,.  as  crystals  melting  at  110°-111°. 

Symmetrical  did  dor- acetone,  CH2C1.C0.CH2C1  (comp.  §  760),  can 
also  be  reckoned  amongst  the  fully  saturated  derivatives  of  isallylene. 
It  is  obtained  by  oxidation  of  dichlorhydrin  (§  679,  2)  with  chromic 
and  sulphuric  acids,  and  occurs  amongst  the  products  of  direct 
chlorination  of  acetone.  It  crystallises  in  colourless  rhombic  tables, 
melts  at  43°,  and  boils  at  172°-174°. 

Homologues  of  Isallylene. 

769.  Several  hydrocarbons  behave  quite  similarly  to  isallylene  as 
regards  their  inability  to  precipitate  ammoniacal  silver  and  cuprous 
compounds,  and  can  therefore  be  regarded  as  homologous  to  it.

can  be  separated  therefrom  in  the  liquid  form  by  pressure.  It  is 
obtained,  similarly  to  acetylene  and  allylene,  by  heating  brom-butylene 
(§  661)  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  : 

CH3.CH2.CBr  :  CH2  +  KOH  =  KBr  +  H20  +  CH3.CH  :  C  :  CH2, 

and  by  passing  a  mixture  of  equal  volumes  of  acetylene  and  ethylene 
through  a  tube  heated  to  dull  redness  : 

CH2 :  CH2  +  CH  ;  CH  =  CH3.CH  :  C  :  CH2. 

It  is  a  colourless  liquid  boiling  at  20°,  which  unites  with  bromine, 
forming  a  liquid  dibromide,  C4HfiBr2,  boiling  at  150°,  and  a  crystal- 
line tetrabromide,  CH3.CHBr.CBr2.CH2Br. 

Isovalerylene,  C5H8  =  (CH3)2C  :  C  :  CH2,  is  formed  from  brom- 
isoainylene  (§  701)  by  alkalies.  It  is  a  liquid  of  garlic  odour  which 
boils  between  42°  and  45°.  It  yields  only  liquid  compounds  with 
bromine;  namely,  a  dibromide,  C5H8Br2,  boiling  at  170°,  and  a  tetra- 
bromide, C5H3Br4  or  (CH3)2  :  CBr.CBr2.CH2Br,  which  cannot  be 
distilled  unchanged.  Some  higher  hydrocarbons  of  the  series, 
CnH2n_2  have  been  prepared  in  similar  manner  from  the  mono- 
halogen  olefines,  but  require  more  investigation  j  e.g.  hexoylene,  C6H10, 
distilling  between  76°  and  80°. 


Derivatives  of  the  Tetrhydric  Alcohol  Radicals. 
Erythrite,  C4H6(OH;4  =  CH2(OH).CH(OH).CH(OH).CH2(OH). 

770.  This  tetrhydric  alcohol,  also  termed  erythro-glucin  ovpL 
occurs  in  Protococcus  vulgaris,  and  is  formed  by  decomposition  of 
erythrin  (contained  in  several  lichens,  e.g.  Rocella  Afontagnei)  by 
boiling  with  lime  or  baryta  water.  The  lichens  arc  best  boiled  with 
milk  of  lime ;  the  excess  of  lime  in  solution  is  then  removed  by  pat 
carbonic  anhydride,  the  filtrate  evaporated  to  a  thin  syrup  and  treated 
with  alcohol.  After  some  time  erythrite  crystallises  out,  and  can  be 
purified  b\  recrj  stallisation  from  boiling  alcohol.  Orcin  and  orsellenic 
acid  are  found  in  the  alcoholic  mother  Qqu 

Erythrite  forms  large  colourless  prismatic  crystals,  which  dissolve 
readily  in  water,  difficultly  in  cold  alcohol,  and  are  insoluble  in  ether. 
It  tastes  sweet,  melts  at  120°,  and  volatilises  with  partial  decompo- 
sition at  about  300°.  Potassic  hydrate  at  250°  decomposes  it  into 
oxalic  and  acetic  acids  : 

C4H6(OH)4  +  3KOH  =  K2C204  +  KC2H30  +  H20  +  4H2. 

By  heating  with  acids  salts  are  obtained.  The  nitrate  termed 
nitro-erythrite,  C4H6(O.N02),,  is  formd  by  solution  of  erythrite  in 
concentrated  nitric  acid,  and  precipitates  on  addition  of  concentrated 
sulphuric  acid  in  colourless  crystalline  leaves.  It  melts  at  61°  and 
explodes  violently  when  struck. 

Hydriodic  acid  converts  erythrite  into  normal  secondary  butylic 
iodide  (§  193);  by   long  heating   with  hydrochloric  or  hydrobromic 
acids  it  exchanges  two  OH  groups  for  halogen,  yielding  dihydrate 
dihaloids  of  its  radical,  which  are  converted  into  dihaloid  diniti 
by  a  mixture  of  sulphuric  and  nitric  acids. 


ERYTHRITE.  451 

Erythrite  dichlorhydrin,  C4H6C12(0H)2,  forms  colourless  crystals 
readily  soluble  in  water,  alcohol,  or  ether,  and  melts  at  145°. 

NUra-erythrite  dichlorhydrin,  C4H6.C12(0.N02)2,  crystallises  in 
needles,  melts  at  60°,  and  is  not  explosive. 

Erythrite  dibromhydrin,  C4H6Br2(OH)2,  melts  at  130°  and  yields 
a  nitrate,  C4H6Br2(O.N02)2,  crystallising  in  brilliant  needles  and 
melting  at  70°. 

771.  By  heating  erythrite  with  formic  acid  a  monoformate  is  first 
formed,  which  (similarly  to  the  decomposition  of  the  monoformin  of 
glycerine  into  allylic  alcohol)  decomposes  between  220°  and  240° 
into  carbonic  anhydride,  water,  and  erythro-glycol : 

C4H6(OH)3(O.CHO)  =  C02  +  H20  +  C4H6(OH)2. 

Erythro-glycol. 

Erytliro-'jhjcol  contains  two  hydrogen  atoms  less  than  butylene 
glycol,  and  probably  has  one  of  the  formulae  : 

CH2 :  CH.CH(OH).CH2.OH  or  CH2.(OH).CH  :  CH.CH2(OH). 

It  is  a  thick  liquid,  soluble  in  water,  boiling  at  199°-200°,  and  unites 
directly  with  two  atoms  of  bromine.  In  its  preparation  there  is  also 
formed  -without  doubt  from  an  erythrite  diformate — a  hydrocarbon 
isomeric  with  crotonylene,  and  which  probably  may  be  the  isolated 
radical  of  erythrite  :

Allylic  iodide  or  bromide  is  generally  used,  and  is  heated  with  sodium

Finely  divided  silver  acts  in  the  same  way  at  100°.  Another  method 
consists  in  heating  mercury  allyl  iodide  (§  664)  with  a  solution  of 
potassic  cyanide  : 

2I.Hg.C3H5  +  2KCN  =  2KI  +  Hg(CN)2  +  Hg  +  C6H10. 

Diallyl  is  a  colourless,  mobile  liquid  of  sp.  gr.  *864,  which  boils  at 
59°  and  has  a  vapour  density  =  2 -83.  It  unites  with  bromine  to  form 
a  crystalline  tetrabromide,  melting  at  63°,  and  with  hydriodic  acid 
to  form  the  compounds  C6HnI  and  C6H12I2,  already  mentioned 
(§§  702  and  491,  2).

Derivatives  of  the  Radicals  of  Disubstituted  Fatty  Acids. 

773.  Whilst  the  replacement  of  one  hydrogen  atom  in  the  radical 
of  a  fatty  acid  yields  compounds  of  the  glycollic  acid  group  only,  the 
replacement  of  two  hydrogen  atoms  can  lead  to  several  categories  of 
bodies. 

1.  If  the  substitution  occur  on  a  single  carbon  atom  it  may 
occur — 

a.  On  a  terminal  carbon  atom.  The  simplest  oxides  must  be  at 
once  aldehydes  and  acids. 

b.  On  an  intermediate  carbon  atom.  There  then  result  derivatives 
of  the  ketonic  acid  radicals. 

2.  The  substitution  may  occur  on  two  different  carbon  atoms. 
There  are  then  formed  the  derivatives  of  the  double  alcohol  acid 
radicals. 

If  the  removal  of  the  hydrogen  atoms  is  from  neighbouring  carbon 
atoms,  double  union  may  ensue.  The  acids  of  this  kind  form  the 
acryl  crotonic  acid  series.

774.  Halogen  Compounds. — These  have  been  to  some  extent 
already  mentioned  in  speaking  of  ethylene  and  acetylene. 

In  the  first  place  there  belongs  to  this  group  the  substitution  pro- 
ducts of  acetylene,  including  the  metallic  derivatives  already  men- 
tioned (§  752). 

Ethinyl  bromide,  C2HBr  =  CH  ■  CBr,  or  brom-acetylene,  is 
obtained,  together  with  acetylene,  by  the  decomposition  of  brom- 
ethylene  dibromide  (§  650)  by  boiling  alcoholic  potassic  h3Tdrate  : 

CH2Br.CHBr2  +  2KOH  =  2KBr  +  2H20  +  CH;CBr. 

It  has  not  yet  been  prepared  in  the  pure  state,  and  is  therefore  little 
known ;  it  is  characterised  by  its  spontaneous  inflammability  in  air. 

Ethinyl  trichloride,  trichlor  ethylene,  CHC1 :  CC12,  is  prepared 
from  acetylene  tetrachloride  by  action  of  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate, 


CHLOBAL.  453 

and  is  an  oil  boiling  at  88°.  The  corresponding  ethinyl  tribromide, 
CHBr:CBr2,  is  also  liquid,  boils  at  130°,  and  after  some  time  changes 
into  a  polymeric  non-volatile  substance. 

Ethinyl  pentahaloids  are  prepared  from  the  foregoing  by  addition 
of  chlorine  and  bromine,  further  from  the  tetrahaloids  of  glycolyl 
(§  708)  and  acetylene  (§  752)  by  direct  substitution  : 

CH2C1.CC13  +  Cl2  =  HC1  +  CHC12.CC13 
and  CHC12.CH.C12  +  Cl2  =  HC1  +  CHC12.CC13. 

Ethinyl  pentachloride,  trichlor  ethylene  dichloride,  is  a  colourless 
oil  of  sp.  gr.  1*6,  which  boils  at  158°.  Ethinyl  pentabromide  crystal- 
lises in  long  prisms,  which  melt  between  48°  and  50°. 

Ethinyl  tetrachloride  ethylate  is  the  tetrachlor  ether  obtained  by 
direct  chlorination  of  ether.  It  is  liquid  and  boils  at  189°-190°  with 
partial  decomposition. 

775.  Chloral,  C2HC130  =  CCl3.CHO.  This  trichlor  acetic  alde- 
hyde is  formed  by  the  action  of  chlorine  on  aldehyde,  alcohol,  sugars, 
and  some  other  compounds.  It  is  obtained  most  readily  by  passing 
dry  chlorine  into  absolute  alcohol  to  complete  saturation.  Consider- 
able quantities  of  ethylic  chloride  and  its  chlor-substitution  products 
volatilise  with  the  hydrochloric  acid  formed  according  to  the 
equation  : 

CH3.CH2.OH  +  4C12  =  5HC1  +  CCl3.CHO. 

Finally  a  crystalline  mass  remains,  consisting  principally  of  a  com- 
pound of  chloral  with  alcohol,  CCl3.CH(OC2H5)(OH),  and  some 
chloral  hydrate,  CC13.CH(0H)2,  which  on  distillation  with  concen- 
trated sulphuric  acid  yields  pure  chloral. 

Chloral  is  a  mobile,  colourless  liquid  of  penetrating  odour  and  sp. 
gr.  1*502,  which  boils  at  94#5°.  On  keeping  it  is  transformed  into  a 
white,  porcelain-like  mass  of  the  polymeric  parachloral,  probably  tri- 
ehloral,  which  distils  at  180°,  being  then  reconverted  into  ordinary 
chloral. 

Chloral  is  a  true  aldehyde,  and  is  therefore  converted  by  oxidation 
— best  with  concentrated  nitric  acid — into  trichlor  acetic  acid,  unites 
with  alkaline  hydric  sulphites  to  form  crystalline  compounds,  yields, 
on  heating  with  acetic  anhydride  to  150°,  trichlor  ethylidene  diacetate, 
CC13.CH(0C2H30)2,  a  clear  oil  boiling  at  222°;  it  unites  directly 
with  acetylic  chloride,  forming  trichlor  ethylidene  aceto-chloride, 
CC13.CHC1(0.C2H30),  which  boils  at  185°.  With  ammonia  and  the 
alkylamides  it  yields  hydratamides  of  trichlor  ethylidene,  e.g. 

cci3.ch;NH2   and  cc^.ch;^^^^ 

as  solid,  fusible  masses.  Phosphoric  chloride  converts  it  into  ethinyl 
pentachloride,  and  nascent  hydrogen  in  acid  solution  (zinc  and  hydro- 
chloric acid)  reconverts  it  into  acetic  aldehyde. 

Chloral  is  distinguished  from  acetic  aldehyde,  on  the  one  hand,  by 
the  greater  energy  of  its  union  with  water,  and  from  alcohol  (comp.  § 
384),  on  the  other,  by  the  more  ready  disruption  of  its  carbon  nucleus. 

Chloral  unites  with  water  with  considerable  evolution  of  heat 
forming

776.  Chloral  hydrate,  CC13.CH(0H)2,  crystallising  in  rhombo- 
hedral  forms  of  the  monoclinic  system.  It  melts  at  46°  and  boils 
at  96°-98°.  It  dissolves  in  water  to  a  liquid  of  neutral  reaction  and 
is  used  medicinally  to  produce  sleep. 

Chloral  also  unites  with  sulphuretted  hydrogen,  forming  chloral

at  123°,  and  is  slowly  decomposed  by  water  into  chloral  hydrate  and 
hydric  sulphide. 

Chloral  hydrate,  when  treated  with  a  concentrated  aqueous  solu- 
tion of  hydric  sulphide,  yields  a  crystalline  mass  of  chloral  hydro- 
sulphide,  [CC13.CH(0H)]2S.  This  dissolves  in  alcohol,  ether,  benzene, 
<fcc,  and  crystallises  in  rhombohedric  forms,  melting  at  127°-128°

chlorine,  by  direct  chlorination  of  ordinary  acetal  (§  405),  and  by 
heating  tetrachlor  ether  with  alcohol  : 

CC13.CHC1.(0.C.2H5)  +  HO.C2II5  =  CC13.CH(0.C2H,)2  +  HC1. 

It  is  a  colourless  oil,  boiling  at  204°-205°. 

777.  Alkaline  reagents  decompose  chloral  and  its  derivatives  into 
chloroform  and  derivatives  of  the  formic  acid  radical.  This  decom- 
position is  most  readily  effected  by  aqueous  alkali*  s  : 

CCl3.CH(OH) ,  +  HOK  =  CC13H  +  CHO.OK  +  H20, 

but  is  also  effected  by  heating  with  ammonia  or  amines.  Chloral 
ethylamine,  e.g.,  thus  decomposes  into  chloroform  and  ethyl  forcnyl- 
amine : 

CCl3.CH;^aHs)H  =  CC13H  +  CHO.N(C2H5)H. 

778.  Bromal,  CBr3.CH  :  0,  or  tribrom-aldehyde,  is  formed,  similarly 
to  chloral,  when  absolute  alcohol  is  saturated  with  bromine,  and  is  a

Diiod-aceiic  acid,  CHI9.CO.OH,  is  prepared  from  dibrom-acetic 
acid  in  like  manner  to  moniod-aoetk  acid  from  monobrom-acetic 
acid  (§  711).  Ethylic  diiod-acetate,  first  formed,  is  a  yellowish  oil, 
which  is  saponified  by  milk  of  lime  and  a  concentrated  solution  of  the 
resulting  calcic  salt,  decomposed  by  hydrochloric  acid.  Dhod-acetic 
acid  crystallises  in  sulphur-yellow  rhombohedra,  which  are  difficultly 
soluble  in  water,  and  decompose  on  heating  with  evolution  of  iodine.

and,  together  with  glycollic  acid,  glyoxal,  and  oxalic  acids,  by  the  oxi- 
dation of  ethylic  alcohol  or  ethylene  glycol  by  nitric  acid.  As 
formerly  mentioned  (§  712),  it  can  be  obtained  pure  by  repeated 
crystallisation  of  its  difficultly  soluble  calcic  Bait.  By  addition  of  the 
requisite  quantity  of  oxalic  acid  the  free  acid  is  obtained  in  solution, 
and  is  left  on  evaporation  of  the  nitrate  as  a  faint  yellow,  readily 
soluble  syrup.     It  volatilises  unchanged  in  water  vapour. 

Its  salts  are  crystalline,  and  when  dried  at  100°  possess  the  for- 
mula CH(OH)2.CO.OM.  The  calcic  salt,  [CH(OH2).CO.O]2Ca,  is 
very  difficultly  soluble  in  cold  water,  and  loses  no  water  at  100°. 
The  amnionic  salt,  on  the  other  hand,  appears  to  have  the  formula 
CHO.CO.ONH4. 

The  aldehyde  properties  of  the  acid  are  shown  in  many  ways.  Its 
alkali  salts  unite  with  alkaline  hydric  sulphites  to  form  crystalline 
compounds  :

Both  actions  are  combined  when  glyoxylates  are  heated  with  strong 
bases.  If  lime  water  be  added  to  a  solution  of  calcic  glyoxylate  a 
white  precipitate  is  first  produced,  which — freshly  produced — is  readily 
soluble  in  acetic  acid  and  is  a  basic  calcic  glyoxylate.  After  some 
time,  or  more  quickly  on  boiling,  it  decomposes  into  soluble  glycollate 
and  insoluble  oxalate  (equation  §  712). 

Dieth-oxyglyoxylic  acid,  CH(O.C2H5)2. CO.OH,  is  obtained  as  a 
sodic  salt  by  the  decomposition  of  ethylic  dichlor-acetate  with  three 
molecules  of  sodic  ethylate  : 

CHCl2.CO.OC2H5  +  3NaO.CoH5  =  2NaCl  +  CH(OC2H5)2CO.ONa 

+  (C2H5)20. 

On  heating  with  ethylic  iodide  it  yields  ethylic  diethyl  glyoxylate, 
CH(O.C2H5)2.CO.O.C2H5,  a  colourless  oil,  boiling  at  199°,  of  sp.  gr. 
•994  at  18°,  and  which  reacts  readily  with  ammonia,  forming  diethyl 
glyoxyl-amide,  CH(O.C2Hr,)2.CO.NH2.  This  latter  crystallises  in  na- 
creous rhombic  tables,  melting  at  76'5°  and  subliming  slowly  at  100°.

incomplete  oxidation  of  succinic  aldehyde  (§  756),  and  is  still  little 
known. 

The  acids  of  the  series  Cn.H2n_3.CO.OH  (see  derivatives  of  the 

radicals  CnH2n_5),  on  oxidation  with  nitric  acid,  yield,  with  halving 

of  their  nuclei,  first  aldehyde  acids,  which  further  oxidise  to  dibasic

at  62°  and  boiling  at  220  -221°,  with  slight  decomposition.  Zinc 
and  sulphuric  acid  reduce  it  to  propionic  acid.  The  barium  salt, 
(CH3.CBr2.CO.O)2Ba  +  90H2,  crystallises  in  silky  needles,  which 
lose  all  their  water  at  90°,  and  also  gradually  on  exposure  to  air.  The 
ethylic  salt,  CH3.CBr2.CO.O.C2H5,  boils  at  190°  (comp.  the  isomeric

ethylic  acetate  with  formation  of  sodium  ethylate  and  ethylic  sod-

The  ketonic  acid  molecules  are  therefore  somewhat  unstable,  like  all 
organic  bodies  containing  many  oxygen  atoms  in  neighl>ouring  com- 
bination, the  nucleus  easily  splitting  up,  and  in  consequence  they 
constitute  very  important  intermediate  bodies,  or  stages,  for  the 
synthesis  of  ketones  and  organic  acids  and  their  derivatives. 


ETHYLIC  ACETO-ACETATE.  459 

786.  Etkylic  aceto-acetate,  CH3.CO.CH2.CO.O.C2H.5.  The 
method  of  preparing  this  body  is  by  acting  on  1,000  grms.  of  pure  and 
perfectly  dry  ethylic  acetate  with  100  grms.  of  sodium  cut  in  small 
pieces  of  about  \  inch  cube.  The  acetic  ether  should  be  contained  in 
a  very  capacious  flask  connected  with  an  inverted  condenser.  The 
sodium  is  introduced  all  at  once,  the  first  violent  action  slightly 
moderated  by  immersing  the  flask  in  cold  water.  Afterwards  it  must 
be  heated  gently  on  a  water  bath,  being  constantly  shaken  the  while, 
until  all  the  sodium  has  disappeared.  It  is  advantageous  to  add 
about  200  cc.  of  dry  benzene  to  the  ether,  to  moderate  the  first  action. 
After  all  the  sodium  has  dissolved  550  grms.  of  50  %  acetic  acid  is 
added  to  the  still  warm  product,  which  is  then  allowed  to  cool,  when 
about  \  litre  of  water  is  added,  and  the  whole  distilled  in  a  water  bath 
to  get  rid  of  the  excess  of  ethylic  acetate.  The  residue  is  now  treated 
with  sufficient  water  to  dissolve  the  sodic  acetate,  and  the  oily  layer 
which  rises  to  the  surface  separated  and  distilled.  After  one  or  two 
fractional  distillations  a  fraction  between  175°  and  185c  will  be  ob- 
tained, and  may  be  used  for  most  purposes.  The  pure  body  boils 
between  181°  and  183°,  a  small  quantity  decomposing  at  each  dis- 
tillation. A  portion  boiling  above  200°  solidifies  on  cooling  to  a 
tlline  mass  of  dehydraeetio  acid,  CsH804. 

The  same  body  is  formed  on  heating  ethylic  aceto-acetate  in  a 
sealed  tube  at  200°-230°  along  with  ethylic  acetate  : 

4CH3.CO.CH2.CO.OC2H5  =  C8H804  +  4CH3.CO.O.C_,TI  . 

It  is  a  difficultly  soluble  acid,  forming  needles,  melting  at  108°. 

Ethylic  aceto-acetate  is  a  liquid  of  a  pleasant  fruity  odour,  of  sp. 
gr.  1*03  at  5°,  boiling  at  180*8  (corr.)  It  reddens  litums  in  presence 
of  water,  and   gi\  utiful    dark   violet   coloration  with  feme 

chloride.  It  distils  unchanged  in  a  current  of  steam.  Strong  acids, 
also  wata  0°,  split  it  up  into  acetone,  alcohol,  and  carl>onic 

acid.  Alkalies  act  similarly;  when  concentrated,  however,  giving 
more  or  less  acetic  acid. 

Nascent  hydrogen  gives  /3-oxy butyric  acid  : 

CH3.CO.CH2.CO.O.C2H5  +  Na2  +  2H20 
=  CH3.CH(OH).CH2.CO.ONa  +  HO.C2H,  +  NaOH. 

Dilute  permanganate  solution  oxidises  it  to  oxalic  and  acetic  acids. 

Bromine  forms  an  addition  product,  C6H10O3Br2,  and  also  a 
substitution  product,  C6HHBr203Br2.     Chlorine  gives 

CH3.CO.CCl2.CO.O.C2H5, 

boiling  at  205°-207°,  sp.  gr.  1'293  at  16°. 

Phosphoric  chloride  gives  two  isomeric  monochlor  crotonic  acids, 
C4H5C102. 

By  the  action  of  strong  bases  one  hydrogen  atom  in  ethylic  aceto- 
acetate  may  be  replaced  by  a  metal,  thus  producing  metallic  deriva- 
tives of  the  form

460      DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  KETONE   ACID   RADICALS,   CnHr, 

In  the  case  of  the  alkali  metals,  e.g.  sodium,  the  metal  may  be  allowed 
to  act  directly  on  the  ethylic  aceto-acetate  in  benzene  solution. 

On  distilling  away  the  liquid  in  vacuo  the  sodium  compound  is 
left  as  a  beautiful  white,  silky,  crystalline  mass. 

A  better  plan  is  to  precipitate  the  sodium  compound  by  the  ad- 
dition of  a  very  small  quantity  of  water.  It  may  then  be  rapidly 
filtered  and  dried  by  pressure. 

Other  Metallic  Derivatives. 

Ethylic  aluminum  aceto-acetate,  (C6H903)3.A1,  separates,  on  mix- 
ing ethylic  aceto-acetate  and  an  alkaline  solution  of  an  aluminum  salt, 
in  the  form  of  beautiful  shining  needles,  melting  at  76°,  soluble  in 
ether,  benzene,  and  CS2,  and  distilling  undecomposed  under  slightly 
diminished  pressure. 

The  copper  compound  (CGH903)2.Cu,  easily  obtained  by  shaking 
ethylic  aceto-acetate  with  ammoniacal  copper  solution,  is  a  green 
crystalline  powder  insoluble  in  water,  but  dissolving  readily  in  hot 
benzene,  alcohol,  carbon  disulphide,  ethylic  iodide,  brom -benzol,  and 
other  oily  liquids,  from  which  it  crystallises  on  cooling  in  brilliant  green 
needles. 

If  carefully  heated  to  178°  it  sublimes  unchanged,  melts  at  1S2°, 
and  decomposes  at  a  higher  temperature.  Mercury,  cobalt,  barium, 
magnesium,  <fcc,  form  similar  compounds. 

Ethylic  nitroso-awto-acetate,  CH3.CO.CH(NO).CO.O.C2H-,.  is 
produced  when  one  molecule  of  ethylic  aceto-acetate  in  dilute  alkaline 
solution  is  treated  with  an  equivalent  of  potassic  nitrite  and  the 
mixture  acidified  with  dilute  sulphuric  acid. 

After  shaking  out  with  ether,  the  nitroso  compound  is  obtained  as 
a  yellow  oil,  which  solidifies  after  some  time.  It  may  be  crystallised 
from  chloroform,  and  then  forms  large  centimetre-thick,  colourless, 
shining  prisms,  melting  at  52°-6  1  .  Jt  is  totally  decomposed  on  dis- 
tillation. It  gives  an  orai il.  ction  with  phenol  and  sulphuric 
acid. 

(  hloroform  acts  violently  on  ethylic  sod-aceto-acetate  with  forma- 
tion of  oxyuvtic  acid. 

Carbonic  sulphide  also  acts  on  the  sodium  compound,  giving  a 
sulpho-acid,  thio-rufic  acid,  C,0HuS3O4,  which  forms  with  sodium 
and  calcium  very  characterise  brilliant  red  crystalline  salts.  By 
the  simultaneous  action  of  carbonic  sulphide  and  plumbic  or  zincic 
oxide  on  ethylic  aceto-ac 

Ethylic  ihiocarb-aceto-acefafe,  CII3.CO.C(CS).CO.O.C.2Hr„  is  pro- 
duced. It  is  a  straw-yellow  crvstalline  body,  melting  between  156° 
and  160°. 

Sodium  amalgam  reduces  it  to  a-methyl  fi-oxybut yric  acid,  a,  yellow 
syrup  which  quickly  changes  into  an  ethereal  anhydride,  and  by  heat- 
ing alone  or  with  hydriodic  acid  is  converted  into  a-methyl  crotonic 
acid. 

Ethylic  methvl  aceto-acetate  gives  with  phosphoric  chloride,  niono- 
chlor  methyl  crotonic  acid,  CH3.CC1  :  C.CH3.CO.OH,  which  splits 
up  under  the  influence  of  alkalies  into  monochlor  butylene  and  car- 
bonic acid. 

When  acted  upon  by  nitrous  acid,  ethylic  methyl  aceto-acetate 


SUBSTITUTED   ACETO-ACETATES.  4G1 

gives  nitroso-methyl  acetone,  CH3.CO.CH(NO).CH3,  or  nitroso-pro- 
pionic  acid,  CH3.OH(NO).CO.OH,  according  to  the  strength  of  the 
acid  employed. 

The  former  body  crystallises  from  chloroform  in  white  prisms  of  a 
peculiar  sweet  odour,  melts  at  74°,  boils  undecomposed  at  185°- 
186°.     It  gives  with  phenol  and  sulphuric  acid  a  bright  red  coloration. 

The  latter  body  results  when  methyl  aceto-acetic  ether  in  dilute 
alkaline  solution  is  treated  with  nitrous  acid.  Ethylic  nitroso-propion- 
ate  is  thus  produced  in  brilliant  prismatic  needles,  melting  at  94°  and 
boiling  with  slight  decomposition  at  233°.  The  free  acid  is  ob- 
tained by  saponification.  It  gives  no  colour  reaction  with  phenol  and 
sulphuric  acid. 

787.   By  the  action  of  methylic  iodide  on  ethylic  sod-aceto-acetate 

Ethylic  methyl  aceto-acetate,  CH,.CO.CH(CH8).(  <  >.«  >.<  ',H5,is pro- 
duced. It  is  a  liquid  very  similar  to  the  original  body,  boils  at  186°- 
187°,  and  has  a  sp.  gr.  of  1'009  at  12°. 

It  decomposes  with  alkalies  into  carbonate,  ethylic  alcohol,  and 
methyl-ethyl  ketone  (§  449).  By  heating  with  sodium  ethylate  ethy- 
lic propionate  is  formed  in  quantity.  It  dissolves  one  atom  of  sodium 
and  forms  CHa.(XXC(CH8)Na.CO.O.C1H5,  which  gives,  on  treatment 
with  methyl  iodide,  ethylic  dimethyl  a  Ue:

a  liquid  almost  insoluble  in  water,  boiling  at  190°,  and  of  .-p.  gr.  '9913

0H2.CCl.C(CHj)2.0O.OH,  forming   monoclinic   crystal-    melting    at

Many  other  substituted  ethers  have  been  obtained  in  a  similar 
manner.

Ethylic  diethyl  aceto-acetate,  CH3.CO.C(C  ,1 1 ,  |  .<  <  >.<>.',  I  i  -,  boils

Ethylic  alhjl  aceto-acetate,  prepared  by  the  action  of  allylic  iodide 
on  the  sodium  compound  of  the  ether,  is  a  liquid  boiling  at  205°-206°, 
sp.  gr.  -982  at  20°. 

Baric  hydrate  splits  it  up  into  metacetone,  mesitylenic  oxide,  and  an 
isomeric  alhjl  acetone,  CH3.CO.CH2.C3H5,  a  colourless  liquid,  boiling 
at  130°  and  not  combining  with  hydric  sodic  sulphite.  It  gives,  on 
oxidation,  allyl  acetic  acid,  C3H5.CH2. CO. OH,  a  liquid  boiling  at  182  .

Ethylic  isopropyl  aceto-acetate,  C9H1603,  is  a  colourless  liquid 
having  the  odour  of  wet  straw;  it  boils  at  201°,  and  gives  isobutyl 
methyl  ketone,  CH3.CO.CH2.CH.(CH3)2,  on  saponification. 

Ethylic  isobutyl  aceto-acetate  :

Ethylic  cetyl  aceto-acetate.  CH3.CO.CH(C16H33)CO.O.C2H5,,  a 
liquid  which  does  not  distil  undecomposed.  It  yields  cetyl  acetic  acid 
and  cetyl-methyl  ketone  on  saponification. 

The  corresponding  ethylic  heptyl  and  octyl  aceto-acetates  have 
also  been  prepared,  and  from  them  the  respective  substituted  acetic 
acids  and  ketones  (comp.  §§  596,  454a,  and  455c). 

788.  Aceto-propionic  acid,  CH3.CO.CH2.CH2.CO.OH,  is  obtained 
as  baric  salt  by  the  action  of  baric  hydrate  on  ethylic  aceto-succinate 
(§  913). 

788a.  Dehydracetic  acid,  C8H804.  The  exact  constitution  of  this 
body  is  not  yet  known.  It  is  a  constant  product  of  the  decomposi- 
tion of  ethylic  aceto-acetate  by  heat,  being  formed  especially  when  the 
vapour  of  that  body  is  passed  through  a  red-hot  tube. 

It  forms  tabular  rhombic  crystals,  melting  at  108 "6°,  boils  at  269° 
with  carbonisation,  and  dissolves  in  1,000  pts.  OH2  at  6°.  It  may  be 
crystallised  from  concentrated  hydrochloric  or  nitric  acids,  and  resists 
the  action  of  strong  sulphuric  acid.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  most 
easily  acted  upon  by  alkalies,  splitting  up  into  acetone,  acetic  and 
carbonic  acids.     It  yields  chlorine  and  bromine  substitution  bodies. 

Bodies  corresponding  to  ethylic  aceto-acetate  and  many  of  its  deri- 
vatives have  been  obtained  from  methylic,  propylic,  amylic,  &c, 
acetates  by  the  action  of  metallic  sodium. 

Derivatives  of  the  Double  Alcohol  Acid  Radicals. 

789.  In  the  fatty  acid  radicals  two  hydrogen  atoms  in  combina- 
tion with  different  carbon  atoms  can  be  eliminated,  and  replaced  either 
by  other  radicals  or  when  the  carbon  atoms  are  contiguous  by  double 
union  of  the  latter.  In  this  manner  two  series  of  acids  result — namely, 
the  double  alcoholic  acids  or  dioxy-acids  and  the  unsaturated  mono- 
basic acids  of  the  acryl  olefine  series. 

Unsaturated  Monobasic  Acids  of  the  Formula 
CnH2n_3O.OH  =  Cn-H^.^CO.OH. 

790.  The  acids  of  this  series  differ  from  the  fatty  acids  containing  the 
same  number  of  carbon  atoms  by  a  deficiency  of  two  hydrogen  atoms, 
whereby  two  neighbouring  carbon  atoms  of  the  group  Cn.H2n'-i  are 
connected  by  double  linking.  In  consequence  of  this  they  combine 
the  properties  of  monobasic  acids  with  those  of  hydrocarbons  of  the 
olefine  series.  As  representing  the  first  they  form  salts,  Sic,  fully 
analogous  in  their  properties  to  those  of  the  fatty  acids. 

On  the  other  hand  they  are  enabled,  owing  to  the  double  union  of 


OLEIC  ACIDS.  463 

tho  carbon,  to  combine  directly  with  the  halogens  or  other  elements, 
the  divalent  combination  being  resolved  into  monovalent.  The  double 
carbon  union  gives  rise,  further,  to  another  peculiarity — namely,  the 
splitting  up  by  action  of  fused  potassic  hydrate  into  two  fatty  acid 
molecules,  the  sum  of  the  carbon  atoms  in  which  is  equal  to  that 
of  the  original  acid  : 

CnH9n_  3O.OH  +  2KOH  =  Cn.Hjn-_iO.OK 

+  C(„_n.)H2(n_I1,)_1O.OK+H2. 

Since  unsaturated  organic  compounds  are  most  easily  oxidised  in 
the  places  where  double  carbon  combination  or  bonds  exist,  and  the 
splitting  up  of  the  nucleus  being  a  consequence  of  oxidation,  the 
position  of  the  double  combination  can  in  many  cases  be  determined 
by  this  method ;  at  the  same  time  it  is  not  one  of  general  applicability. 

For  example,  the  two  normal  isomeric  cro tonic  acids  : 

(a)  CH3.CH  :CH.CO.OH  and  (/3)  CH2  :  CH.CH2.CO.OH, 

both  give,  when  melted  with  OKH,  two  molecules  of  potassic 
acetate,  a  result  to  be  expected  from  the  formula  of  the  a-acid, 
whereas  the  ft  should  yield  formic  and  propionic  acids.  The  cause 
of  this  apparently  striking  divergence  from  theory  is  accounted  for  by 
the  observed  fact  that  /3-crotonic  acid  is  converted  by  simply  heating 
to  180°  directly  into  the  a-acid  : 

CH2 :  CH.CH2.CO.OH  =  CH3.CH~:  CH.CO.OH, 

bo  that  really  only  the  a-acid  is  subjected  to  the  action  of  the  melting 
alkali. 

791.  Tho  higher  members  of  the  series  are  termed  oleic  acids,  and 
occur  in  fatty  liquid  oils  as  glycerine  salts  along  with  salts  of  the 
fatty  acids,  from  which  they  may  be  separated  by  the  solubility 
of  their  lead  salts  in  ether,  as  already  stated  (§  563). 

The  lower  members  of  the  series  combine  with  hydrogen  to  form 
acids  of  the  form  CnH2n_iO.OH;  the  higher  members,  however,  do 
not  possess  this  power. 

The  halogen  addition  products  are  decomposed  by  alcoholic 
potash  in  the  same  way  as  the  alkylene  dibromides ;  that  is,  with 
every  bromine  atom  a  hydrogen  atom  is  split  off,  so  that  at  first 
simple  halogen  substitutes  of  the  original  acid  result,  and  finally 
halogen  free  acids  with  less  hydrogen  of  the  formula  CnH2n_3.CO.OH  : 

CnH2n_2Br.CO.OK  +  KOH  =KBr  +  H20  +  CnH2n_3CO.OK. 

Several  of  the  higher  members  of  this  series  are  changed  by  contact 
with  nitrous  acid  into  isomers  (difficultly  fusible),  the  construction 
of  which  is  not  yet  fully  known. 

Acrylic  Acid,  C3H402  =  CH2  :  CH.CO.OH. 

792.  This  acid  is  obtained  by  the  oxidation  of  an  aqueous  solution 
of  acrolein  (§  763)  by  means  of  freshly  prepared  argentic  oxide.  The 
action  completes  itself  after  some  time  at  the  ordinary  temperature, 
when  the  whole  is  heated  to  boiling  and  the  dissolved  argentic  acrylate 
decomposed  by  sodic  hydrate,  the  sodic  salt  evaporated  to  dryness 


464  DOUBLE  ALCOHOL   ACID   RADICALS,   CnH2n_3. 

and  decomposed  by  dilute  sulphuric  acid  and  the  acrylic  acid  se- 
parated by  distillation. 

Glycerin  iodo-propionie  acid,  when  treated  with  alcoholic  potash, 
gives  along  with  a  salt  of  hydracrylic  also  that  of  acrylic  acid.  A 
better  method  consists  in  distilling  glycerine  iodo-propionic  acid  over 
finely  powdered  plumbic  oxide  ;  the  hydracrylic  acid  is  then  decom- 
posed into  water  and  acrylic  acid. 

In  the  dry  condition  acrylic  acid  is  only  obtained  by  decomposing 
a  silver  or  lead  salt  by  dry  SH2,  in  which  case  it  is  a  colourless, 
strongly  acid  liquid,  crystallising  in  the  cold  and  miscible  in  all 
proportions  with  water.  It  melts  between  7°  and  8°  and  boils  at 
139°-140°.  It  combines  very  slowly  with  nascent  hydrogen,  but  b) 
long  contact  with  zinc  and  dilute  sulphuric  acid  in  the  warm  it  is 
completely  converted  to  propionic  acid  : 

CH2  :  CH.CO.OH  +  2H  =  CH3.OH2.CO.OH. 

Most  of  its  salts  are  easily  soluble  in  water.  Its  sodium  salt  can  be 
obtained  by  evaporation  as  a  white,  scarcely  crystalline  mass,  not 
dissolving  to  any  appreciable  extent  even  in  boiling  alcohol.  The 
lead  salt  forms  long  shiny  prisms  of  the  formula  (C3H302)2I>b- 
The  silver  salt,  C3H302Ag,  crystallises  in  fine  needles. 

The  potassic  salt,  when  fused  with  potash,  gives  potassic  acetate 
and  formate  : 

C3H3O.OK  +  KOH  +  OH2  =  C2H3O.OK  +  CHK02  +  H2. 

Ethylic  acrylate  is  the  only  ethereal  salt  of  acrylic  acid  known,  being 
obtained  from   p-dibrom-propionic  ether  by  the  action  of  zinc  and 
sulphuric  acid  : 
CH2Br.CHBr.CO.OC2H5  +  H2  =  2IIBr  +  CH2 :  CH.CO.OC2H5. 

It  is  a  liquid  of  penetrating  odour,  boiling  at  101°-102°,  of  sp.  gr. 
at  0°  -025. 

793.  The  haloid  acids  combine  with  acrylic  acid  to  form  the 
so-called  /3-halogen  propionic  acids  (§  744),  by  means  of  which  it  can 
easily  be  reconverted  into  hydracrylic  acid.  The  halogens  combine 
similarly,  bromine  forming  /3-dibrom-propionic  acid,  isomeric  with 
a-dibroru-propionic  acid  (§  784). 

fy-Dibrom-propumic  acid,  CH2Br.CHBr.CO.OH,  also  obtained  by 
the  oxidation  of  allyl  alcohol  dibromide  with  strong  nitric  acid;  it  is 
colourless  and  crystalline,  melts  at  64°-65°,  dissolves  easily  in  water, 
and  decomposes  on  distillation.  Its  ethylic  salt  is  a  fruity-smelling 
oil,  boiling  between  211°  and  214°. 

Boiling  alcoholic  potash  converts  it  into  the  potassium  salt  of 

t]- Br o m-acrylic  acid,  CHBr  :  CH.CO.OH,  which  latter  crystallises 
in  small  prisms,  fusing  between  69°  and  70°,  and  combining  directly 
with  hydric  bromide  to  reform  /3-dibrom-propionic  acid.  The  potas- 
sium salt  forms  beautiful  tables. 

ll-Broiii-acri/lic  acid,  CH2  :  CBr.CO.OH,  obtained  with  difficulty 
from  u-dibrom-propionic  acid  by  treatment  by  alcoholic  potash,  also 
melts  at  69°-70°.     The  potassic  salt  forms  rhombic  tables. 

It  combines  likewise  with  hydric  bromide  to  form  /3-dibrom- 
propionic  acid,  so  that  by  this  means  propionic  can  be  reduced  to 
acrylic  acid. 


CROTONIC   ACIDS.  465 

Crotonic  Acids,  C4H602. 

794.  Three  isomeric  acids  of  this  formula  are  known. 

1.  a-Crotonic  acid,  CH3.CH  :  CH.CO.OH,  improperly  termed 
crotonic  acid,  is  obtained  by  the  oxidation  of  its  aldehyde  (§  765),  by 
dry  distillation  of  /3-oxybutyric  acid  (§  747,  2)  : 

CH3.CH(OH).CH2.CO.OH  =  H20  +  CH3.CH  :  CH.CO.OH, 
by  heating  ethylic  a-brom-butyrate  with  potassic  hydrate : 
CH3.CH2.CHBr.CO.O.C2H5  +  20KH  =  KBr  +  0H9  +  HO.C2H5 
+  CH3.CH  :  CH.CO.OK, 

and  by  boiling  allylic  cyanide  with  potash. 

In  the  latter  case,  however,  a  shifting  of  the  hydrogen  atoms  and 
the  position  of  the  double  carbon  union  takes  place.  The  structural 
constitution  of  allylic  iodide  is  undoubtedly  CH2  :  CH.CH2I.  This  on 
heating  with  potassic  cyanide  should  give  the  nitrile  of  /3-crotonic 
acid,  0H2  :  CH.CH2.CN,  which  by  treatment  with  potassic  hydrate 
would  be  expected  to  yield  p-crotonic  acid,  instead  of  which  « -crotonic 
acid  is  formed. 

Owing  to  the  easy  convertibility  of  the  ,?-acid  to  the  «,  the  facts 
are  not  very  surprising ;  indeed,  it  is  quite  a  question  whether  the 
nitrile  contains  the  nucleus  of  the  a-acid  and  reacts  in  this  manner  : 

CH2:CH.CH2I  +  KCN  =  KI  +  CH3.CH  :  <  H  <  \ 

or  if  the  nitrile  of  the  /3-acid  is  first  formed,  and  during  the  replace- 
ment of  the  nitrogen  atom  by  oxygen  the  hydrocarbon  radical 
changed  to  that  of  the  a-crotonic  acid. 

a-Crotonic  acid  crystallises  in  tables  or  needles  melting  at  72  ,  and 
distils  at   180°  without  change;  it  is  slowly  converted  by  na 
hydrogen  into  butyric  acid  ;  nitric  acid  oxidises  it  to  acetic  and  oxalic 
acids,  chromic  acid  to  acetic  and  carbonic  acids,  and  by  melting  with 
potassic  hydrate  it  is  split  up  into  two  acetic  acid  molecules. 

Hvdric  iodide  and  bromide  combine  with  it  to  form  the  two 
possible  a-  and  /3  halogen  butyric  acids  : 

aCH3.CH  :  CH.CO.OH  +  oHI  =  6CH3.CH,.CHI.CO.OH 
+  (a  -  6)CH3.CHI.CH2.CO.OH, 

which  by  boiling  with  potash  yield  a  mixture  of  o-  and  /3-oxybutyric 
acids. 

795.  Two  molecules  of  phosphoric  chloride  act  with  great  energy 
on  one  molecule  of  ethylic  aceto-acetate,  forming  a  mixture  of  the 
chlorides  of  two  different  crotonic  acids. 

Similarly  to  the  reaction  between  phosphoric  chloride  and  acetone 
(§  445),  the  action  is  here  not  exactly  confined  to  that  represented  in 
the  equation  : 

CH3.CO.CH2.CO.O.C,H5  +  2PC15  =  2P0C13  +  C2H5C1 
+  CH3.CC12.CH2.C0.C1; 

but  hydric  chloride  is  also  formed  under  the  assumption  of  difference 
in  '  place  value  '  of  the  hydrogen  atom  : 

aCH3.CCl2.CH2.CO.Cl  =  aHCl  +  6CH3.CC1 :  CH.CO.C1 
+  (a  -  b)C¥L2 :  CC1.CH2.C0.C1.

466  DOUBLE  ALCOHOL  ACID  EADICALS,   CnH2n_3. 

On  contact  with  water  the  chlorides  decompose  into  the  two  isomeric 
chlor-crotonic  acids : 

CH3.CCl.CH.CO.OH  and  CH2  :  CCl.CH2.CO.OH, 

which  are  separable  by  difference  of  solubility. 

Chlor  a-crotonic  acid,  CH3.CC1 :  CH.CO.OH,  crystallises  in  colour- 
less prisms,  melting  at  94°,  boiling  206°-211°,  soluble  in  35  parts 
cold  water,  easily  in  hot  water.  Sodium  amalgam  gives  a-crotonic 
acid  : 

CH3.CCI :  CH.CO.OH  +  Na2  =  STaCl  +  CH3.CH  :  CH.CO.ONa. 

Probably  the  same  crotonic  acid  results  from  the  action  of  zinc  and 
HC1  on  trichlor  crotonic  acid,  C4H3C1302,  obtained  by  the  oxidation  of 
trichlor  crotonic  aldehyde  with  nitric  acid  in  colourless  needles,  melting 
at  44°. 

Chlor  ft-crotonic  acid,  CH2  :  CCl.CH2.CO.OH,  forms  needles 
difficultly  soluble  in  water,  melting  at  59*5°,  and  subliming  even  at 
ordinary  temperatures  and  boiling  at  195°.  Sodium  amalgam  in 
aqueous  solution  gives  the  salt  of 

796.  2.  ft-Crotonic  acid,  CH2 :  CH.CH2.CO.OH,  isocrotonic  or 
quartenylic  acid,  a  liquid  not  freezing  at  —15°,  boiling  at  172°,  but 
leaving  a  small  residue  of  o -crotonic  acid  at  each  distillation  and  com- 
pletely changed  into  the  latter  by  heating  in  tube  to  180°.  /3-Crotonic 
acid,  by  heating  with  potassic  hydrate,  splits  up  into  acetic  acid  only, 
whereas  from  its  structure  formic  and  propionic  acids  were  to  be 
expected.

797.  1.  Methyl  crotonic  acid,  CH3.CH :  C(CH3).CO.OH,  tiglic

ANGELIC   ACID.  467 

on  ethylic  eth-meth-oxalate  (comp.  §  749,  2)  ethylic  methyl  crotonate, 
CH3.CH  :  C(CH3).CO.O.C2H5,  is  obtained  as  a  liquid  boiling  at  156°. 
The  free  acid  crystallises  in  triclinic  prisms,  melting  at  62° ,  and  is 
decomposed  into  acetate  and  propionate  by  fusion  with  potassic 
hydrate. 

Croton  oil  (from  the  seeds  of  Croton  Tiglium)  contains,  in  addition 
to  the  glycerine  salts  of  numerous  acids  of  the  acetic  series,  the  salt  of 
an  acid,  tiglic  acid,  which  appears  to  be  identical  with  methyl  crotonic 
acid  ;  it  melts  at  64°  and  boils  at  19"8"5°.  This  acid  is  also  obtained 
from  oil  of  camomile  (Anthemis  nobilis),  by  saponification  of  the 
alkaloids  of  Veratrum  SabadUla  and  by  heating  angelic  acid.  Hydro- 
bromic  acid  converts  it  into  a  brom-valeric  acid. 

2.  p-Dimeth-acrylic  acid,  (CH3)2C  :  CH.CO.OH,  is  prepared  from 
hydroxy-isopropyl  acetic  acid,  (CH3)2.C(OH).CH2.CO.OH,  by  dis- 
tillation with  sulphuric  acid.  It  forms  monoclinic  prisms,  melting 
at  70°. 

3.  Angelic  acid  occurs  in  the  root  of  Angelica  archangelica  and 
in  Eurysangium  sumbul,  camomile  oil  and  the  roots  of  various  Um- 
belliferae,  from  which  it  may  be  obtained  by  boiling  the  roots  with  milk 
of  lime  and  decomposing  the  filtered  solution  with  sulphuric  acid, 
and  distilling  in  a  current  of  steam,  the  angelic  acid  passing  over,  and 
from  laserpitin  and  peucedanin  by  the  action  of  potassic  hydrate. 

The  acid  forms  large  monoclinic  prisms,  melting  at  45°  and 
boiling  at  185°,  a  portion  being  converted  into  an  isomeric  modifica- 
tion during  the  process.  It  is  insoluble  in  cold  but  easily  soluble  in 
hot  water,  and  also  in  alcohol  and  ether.  Its  Baits  are  mostly  soluble 
in  water.  Nascent  hydrogen  has  no  effect  on  the  acid  either  in  acid 
or  alkaline  solution  ;  with  HI  it  is  reduced  to  a  valeric  acid.  Bro- 
mine forms  a  dibrom-valeric  acid,  melting  at  76°  and  giving  an  oily 
brom-butylene  on  boiling  with  caustic  potash  : 

C4H7Br2.CO.OK  +  2KOH  =  C4H7Br  +  K2C03  +  KBr  +  OH2. 

The  exact  constitution  of  angelic  acid  is  not  yet  known,  and  indeed 
its  isomerism  with  n-/3-dimethyl  acrylic  acid  cannot  be  represented 
by  the  notation  at  present  in  use. 

4.  Allyl  acetic  acid,  C3H5.CH2.CO.OH,isa  colourless  oil  of  boiling 
point  182°,  obtained  by  the  decomposition  of  ethylic  allyl-aceto- 
acetate. 

Acids  of  the  Formula  C6H10O2. 

798.   1.  Ethyl  crotonic  acid,  a-methyl  ft-eth-acrylic  acid: 

CH3.CH  :  C(C2H5).CO.OH, 

is  obtained  as  ethylic  salt  on  treating  ethylic  dieth-oxalate  (§  750,  2) 
with  PC13  and  then  with  water.  It  forms  square  prisms  melting  at 
41-5°,  sublimes  at  ordinary  temperatures,  and  gives  butyrate  and 
acetate  on  fusion  with  potash. 

_  2.  Hydro-sorbic  acid,  a-propyl  acrylic  acid,  C5H9.CO.OH,  is  ob- 
tained from  sobric  acid  by  the  action  of  sodium  amalgam.  It  is  only 
slightly  soluble  in  water,  is  liquid  at  -18°,  boils  at  204°,  and  at  19° 
has  a  sp.  gr.  of  ;969 ;  fusion  with  potassic  hydrate  splits  it  up  into 
acetic  and  butyric  acids.

is  obtained  by  the  dry  distillation  of  terebic  acid,  C7H10O4.  It  is 
an  oil  boiling  at  210° ;  fusing  potash  gives  isobutyric  and  acetic

Higher  Members  of  the  CnH2n_202  Series. 

799.  These  bodies  are  very  imperfectly  known,  there  being  still 
many  gaps  in  the  series. 

icic  acid,  C15H2802,  occurs  in  a  free  state  in  a  beetle  (Rhaphi- 
gaster  punctipennis),  from  which  it  may  be  extracted  by  ether.  It 
melts  at  44°. 

Jf'/pogceic  acid,  C16H30O2,  exists  in  earth-nut  oil  (Arachis  hypogae) 
along  with  arachic  acid  (§  598),  and  also  in  the  sperm  oil  of  Physeter 
macrocephaUiS.  It  forms  colourless  needles,  melting  at  33°  and 
soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether.  It  oxidises  in  the  air  and  combines 
with  bromine  to  form  dibromrpahnitic  acid,  C16H30Br2O2,  melting 
point  29u,  which,  on  treatment  with  potash,  gives  monobrom-hypoy&ic 
arid,  C16H29Br02. 

Nitrous  acid  converts  hypogseic  acid  into  an  isomeric  gceidic  add, 
of  melting  point  39°,  which  does  not  oxidise  in  air  or  decompose  on 
distillation. 

800.  Oleic  acid,  Cj8H3402,  is  found  as  a  glycerine  salt  in  nearly 
all  fats,  C3H5(O.C18H330)3.  Almond,  olive,  and  whale  oils  are 
especially  rich  in  this  salt.  The  acid  is  obtained  by  saponification 
with  plumbic  oxide  and  finally  purified  by  means  of  its  barium  salt. 

It  is  a  colourless,  tasteless  oil,  solidifying  at  0°,  and  afterwards 
melting  at  14  .  It  <li>tils  in  superheated  steam  at  about  250°.  When 
distilled  alone  it  splits  up  into  a  mixture  of  sebacic,  caproic,  caprylic 
acids,  and  other  bodies.  It  rapidly  oxidises  in  the  air,  and  gives  ^alts 
with  the  alkalies  which  are  true  soaps.  It  combines  with  bromine  to 
form  C,  J  I  . ;  1 1) ■_«  ) _,,  from  which  brom-oleic  and  stearolic  acids  may  be 
obtained  by  the  action  of  potassic  hydrate. 

Oleic  acid  is  converted  by  nitrous  acid  into  the  isomeric  ela'idic 
aci  lt  forming  leafy  crystals  of  45c  melting  point.  This  acid  also 
forms  a  dibromide  from  which  nascent  hydrogen  reduces  the  original 
acid.     Oleic  acid,  when  Cosed  with  alkalies,  gives  acetic  and  palmitic 

i  hydroxy-oleic  acid,  C18H3403,  stands  in  near 
relationship  to  oleic  acid.     Its  glycerine  salt  is  found  in  linseed  oil. 

Iso  gives  an  isomeric  crystalline  modification,  melting  at  50°,  on 
treatment  with  nitrous  acid.  It  does  not  oxidise  on  exposure  to  air, 
and  gives  on  dry  distillation  cenanthol,  and  with  potash  yields  normal 

odary  octyl  alcohol  along  with  methyl-hexyl  ketone  and  sebacic

Erucic  aeidj  C22H4202,  also  called  brassic  acid,  is  obtained  from 
rape-seed  oil,  mustard  oil,  and  also  from  grape  seeds  or  kernels.  It  is 
purified  by  means  of  its  lead  Bait  in  similar  manner  to  that  already 
described  for  other  members  of  the  series.  It  forms  long  shining 
needles  melting  at  34°.  With  bromine  it  gives  a  dibromide, 
C22H42Br202,  forming  warty  crystals  melting  at  42°-43°,  decom- 
posed bv  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  into  brom-erucic  acid,  CaaH41BrO  ,. 
fusing  at  33°-34°. 

Dihydroxy-acids,  CnH2n_  3(OH)2O.OH. 

802.  The  only  known  member  of  this  series  is  glyceric  acid, 
dih yd 'rosy- propionic  acid,  C3H604,  the  product  of  the  gentle  oxi- 
dation of  glycerine  by  nitric  acid  or  by  bromine  and  water. 

For  its  preparation  a  mixture  of  equal  parts  of  glycerine  and 
water  contained  in  tall  glass  cylinders  is  very  slowly  mixed  with 
double  its  volume  of  nitric  acid,  of  sp.  gr.  1*3,  by  means  of  a  long 
funnel  tube  reaching  to  the  bottom  of  the  liquid.  After  standi) 
few  days,  until  the  liquid  has  become  homogeneous,  it  is  evaporated 
to  a  syrup,  which  is  then  diluted  with  water  and  neutralised  with 
plumbic  carbonate.  After  several  recrystallisations  and  treatment 
with  animal  charcoal  the  pure  suit  is  decomposed  by  hydrie  sulphide. 
The  nitrate,  on  evaporation,  yields  the  free  acid  as  a  syrup. 

Its  salts  are  mostly  soluble  and  crystallisable.  The"  calcic  aaUs 
(C3H504)2Ca  +  20H._„  crystallises  in  concentrically  grouped  prisms. 
The  ethylic  s<rft,  ( !  {H  ,,(( \,1 1  -)04,  is  a  viscid  liquid,  boiling  at 
230°-240°,  sp.  gr.  1-193  at  6°,  soluble  in  water,  and  easily  decomposing 
into  free  acid  and  alcohol. 

Glyceric  acid  is  a  monobasic  acid  and  also  a  diatomic  alcohol,  and 
possibly  has  the  constitution  CH2(OH).CH(OH).CO.OH,  but  the  pro- 
cess of  oxidation  and  constitution  may  also  be  expressed  by  the 
following  equation  : 

CH,.OH  CHo.OH 

I  I 

CH.OH  +  02  ==  OH2  +      C.OH 

I  /\ 

CH2.OH  O— CH.OH 

On  heating  to  140°  the  acid  gives  a  gummy  substance,  which  is  pro- 
bably an  ethereal  anhydride  (§  707).  At  a  higher  temperature  it 
gives  off  more  water,  and  passes  for  the  most  part  into  pyro-racemic 
or  pyruvic  acid  with  a  little  pyro-tartaric  acid  : 

C3H604  =  OH2  +  C3H403 

Pyruvic  acid. 

Treated  with  hydriodic  acid  it  gives  glycerine  iodo-propionic  acid 
(§  744) ;  with  phosphoric  chloride,  the  chloride  of  /3-dichlor-propionic 
acid  : 

C3H604  +  PC13  =  3P0C13  -f-  3HC1  +  C3H3C120.C1. 

Boiling  potassic  hydrate  solution  converts  glyceric  acid  into  oxalate 
and  lactate.     Melted  potash  gives  acetate  and  formate.

Aceto-formic      acid,      pyroracemic      acid,      or      pyruvic      acid, 

CH3.CO.CO.OH,  is  obtained  from  glyceric  acid,  as  above,  or  from 

tartaric  acid :

I  =  C02  +  H20  +      >0  or 

CH(OH).CO.OH  fa  c0  0H  CO.CO.OH 

It  is  a  liquid  miscible  with  water  and  boiling  between  165°  and  170°, 
decomposing,  however,  slightly  during  distillation.  Its  monobasic 
salts  are  crystallisable,  but  lose  this  property  on  warming  their 
solutions. 

The  acid  cannot  be  obtained  unchanged  on  acidifying  its  salts,  but 
is  converted  into  a  syrupy  non-volatile  acid,  giving  pyro-tartaric  acid 
on  distillation. 

Nascent  hydrogen  converts  it  into  ordinary  lactic  acid,  and  by 
heating  with  hydric  iodide  either  lactic  or  propionic  acid  may  be  pro- 
duced, according  to  the  temperature  or  relative  quantities  employed  :

With  bromine  it  forms  an  extremely  unstable  crystalline  com- 
pound, C3H4Br203.  At  a  temperature  of  100°  bromine  gives  a 
dibrom-pyroracemic  acid,  C3H2Br203  +  20H2,  which  forms  large 
rhombic  crystals.  Phosphoric  chloride  converts  it  into  dichlor  pro- 
pionic chloride.  By  long  heating  with  baric  hydrate  solution  salts  of 
acetic,  oxalic,  and  nitric  acids  are  produced. 

Propionyl  formic  acid,  CH3.CH2. CO.CO.OH,  is  a  colourless  oily 
liquid,  of  sp.  gr.  1*12  and  boiling  at  74°-78°  under  a  pressure  of 
25  mm. 

But yryl  formic  acid,  CH3.CH2.CH2. CO.CO.OH,  is  a  colourless 
liquid,  boiling  with  slight  decomposition  at  180°-185°  under  ordinary 
atmospheric  pressure. 

Serine,  sericine,  C3H7N03,  is  related  to  glyceric  acid  in  the  same 
manner  that  glycocine  is  to  glycollic  acid  or  alanine  to  lactic  acid.  It 
is  a  product  of  the  decomposition  of  silk  by  boiling  dilute  Milphuric 
acid. 

Serine  crystallises  in  hard  prisms,  soluble  in  cold  water,  but  in- 
soluble in  alcohol.  It  has  a  faintly  sweet  taste,  and  behaves  towards 
acids  and  bases  like  a  glycine  (§  718);  e.g.  it  combines  one  equivalent 
of  an  acid  and  allows  one  hydrogen  atom  to  be  rejDlaced  by  a  metal. 
Its  salts  are  all  crystallisable. 

Nitrous  acid  converts  it  into  glyceric  acid  : 

C3H3(OH)(NH2)O.OH  +  HO.NO  =  H20  +  N2 
+  C3H3(OH)2O.OH. 

Cystine,  C3H7N02S,  appears  to  be  a  sulphur  derivative  of  serine. 
It  has  been  found  in  urine  and  in  the  kidneys  in  very  small  quantity ; 
in  larger  quantity  in  some  forms  of  urinary  calculi,  from  which  it  may

be  extracted  by  ammonia  solution  and  obtained  in  minute  colourless 
six-sided  tabular  crystals. 

It  is  insoluble  in  water  and  alcohol,  but  dissolves  in  alkalies  and 
acids,  forming  crystalline  salts  with  the  latter.  It  is  non-volatile, 
and  decomposes  on  heating  with  production  of  a  most  penetrating

804.  By  removal  of  two  hydrogen  atoms  from  allyl  and  substitution 
of  a  triple  for  a  double  carbon  union,  the  primary  radical  propargyl  is 
formed.  The  propargyl  compounds  therefore  appear  as  allyene 
(§  759),  in  which  one  hydrogen  atom  of  the  methyl  group  has  been 
replaced  by  halogens  or  oxygen  nuclei,  kc.  :

805.  Propargylic  alcohol,  C3H40  =  CH  \  C.CH.2.OH,  is  obtained 
from  a-brom-allylic  alcohol  (§  768)  by  heating  with  potassic  hydrate 
and  a  little  water  in  a  vessel  attached  to  an  inverted  condenser : 

CH2:CBr.CH2.OH  +  KOH  =  KBr  +  H_<>  +  CH    <  AiJ,OH. 

The  excess  of  potassic  hydrate  is  neutralised  with  carbonic  anhydride, 
and  the  aqueous  propargylic  alcohol  distilled  off;  potassic  carbonate 
added  to  the  distillate  to  saturation,  the  separated  lighter  layer  re- 
moved, dried  by  rosed  potassic  carbonate  and  rectified. 

Propargylic  alcohol  is  a  colourless  mobile  liquid  of  burning  taste 
and  agreeable  smell,  miscible  with  water.  Its  sp.  gr.  is  '9628  at  21°, 
the  vapour  density  1*9;  it  boils  at  115°.  The  vapour  burns  in  air 
with  a  strongly  luminous  flame.  It  yields  a  siskin-green  precipitate 
with  ammoniacal  cuprous  chloride,  which  burns  explosively  on  heating, 
and  probably  has  the  formula  : 

Cu.CC.CH2.OH

Ammoniacal  argentic  chloride  gives  a  white  precipitate  of  analogous 
composition,  Ag2(C  :C.CH2.OH)2.  Both  metallic  compounds  yield 
propargylic  alcohol  when  treated  with  hydrochloric  acid.  It  combines 
directly  with  bromine,  and  with  strong  hydrobromic  acid  regenerates 
a-brom-allylic  alcohol. 

It  reacts  on  phosphorus  tribromide,  forming  propargylic  bromide, 
CH  j  C.CH2Br,  a  colourless  liquid  of  sp.  gr.  1*52  at  20°  and  boiling  at 
88°-90°,  whilst  acetylic  chloride  converts  it  into  propargylic  acetate, 
CH  \  C.CH2.O.C2H30,  a  liquid  of  unpleasant  odour,  boiling  at  125°. 

Propargyl-ethyl  ether,  C5H80  =  CH  :  C.CH2.O.C2H5,  is  obtained 
when  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  acts  on  glyceryl  trihaloids  : 

CH2C1.CHC1.CH2C1  +  2KOH  +  KOC2H5  =  3KC1  +  2H20

806.  Although  the  first  substitution  products  of  the  acids 
CnH2n  _  20.2  (§  792),  and  also  ricinolic  acid  (§  800),  are  monobasic  acids 
of  this  group,  it  has  been  more  convenient  to  consider  them  at  another 
place. 

Compounds  of  the  Double  Acid  Radicals,  CnH2n:(C=E)2. 

807.  The  chief  representatives  of  this  group  are  the  dibasic  acids 

and  the  derivatives  of  their  oxy-radicals,  the  diacid  oxyls,  Cn,H.2n  (CO)2. 
The  only  compounds  known  free  from  oxygen  are  some  nitiiles  and  a 
number  of  varied  derivatives  of  the  dicarbon  nucleus  [  C.C  • . 

The  dibasic  acids  stand  to  the  monobasic  acids  in  the  same  relation 
as  the  glycols  to  the  monhydric  alcohols.  All  metamorphoses  of  the 
monobasic  acids  can  be  suffered  by  them  either  singly  or  doubly. 
Thus  they  form  two  series  of  salts  :

together  with  salts  of  the  latter. 

The  formation  of  anhydrides  and  imides  probably  occurs  in  a  dif- 
ferent way  to  that  in  the  fatty  acids,  the  anhydro-oxvgen  atom  or 
divalent  imid  group  not  being  attached  to  two  diacid  oxyls,  but  to 
both  bonds  of  a  single  diacid  oxyl  :

Nearly  all  members  of  the  series  are  formed  by  the  oxidation  of 
the  fatty  acids,  CnH2n02,  of  high  carbon  contents,  also  from  the  acids 
of  the  oleic  series,  CnH2n_202,  and  the  acids,  CnH2n_402,  and,  in  con- 
sequence, also  from  the  monhydric  alcohols  and  fats.  Frequently  in 
these  cases  several  dibasic  acids  are  formed  at  the  same  time,  that  first 
formed  being  further  oxidised  into  carbonic  anhydride,  water,  and  an 
acid  of  less  carbon  contents  : 

CnH2n  (CO.OH)  +  30  =  C02  +  H20  +  C^H^.  ^(CO.OH),. 

The  following  methods  of  preparation  are  accompanied  with  nucleus 
synthesis. 

Alkylene  dihaloids  react  on  potassic  cyanide,  forming  alkylene 
dicyanides,  the  rritriles  of  the  radicals  of  the  dibasic  acids  : 

CnH2nBr2  +  2K.CN  =  2KBr  +  CnH2n(CN)2, 

which,  by  boiling  with  acids  or  alkalies,  are  converted  into  the  dibasic 
acids  and  ammonia. 

The  monohalogen  substitution  derivatives  of  the  fatty  acids 
similarly  yield  the  half-nitriles  : 

Cn.H2n.Br  CnH2n.CN 

|  +  K.C2ST  =  KBr  +  | 

CO.OK  CO.OK 

which  also  yield  dibasic  acids  on  boiling  with  acid  or  alkalies. 

The  moniodo  fatty  acids,  on  heating  with  finely  divided  silver,  give 
up  their  iodine  to  the  latter,  the  two  residues  uniting  with  one 
another,  e.g. 

CH2.CO.OH 
(I.CH2.CO.OH)2  +  Ag2  -  Ag2I2  +  | 

CH2.CO.OH 

809.  The  dibasic  acid  can  be  converted  into  the  fatty  acid  of  next 
lower  carbon  contents — though  always  only  in  part — by  fusing  with 
potassic  hydrate  containing  some  water  : 

CnH2n!caOK  +  H0K  =  C°(°K)2  +  CnH2n+1.CO.OK. 


DICARBON  HEXACHLORIDE.  475 

On  electrolysis  the  alkaline  salts  of  the  dibasic  acids  yield  alky- 
lenes,  containing  two  carbon  atoms  less,  similarly  to  the  formation  of 
the  dialkyls  from  the  fatty  acids  :

810.  Dicarbon  hexa chloride,  C2C16,  also  termed  sesquichloride  of 
carbon  and  perchlor  ethane,  is  the  last  chlor  substitution  product  of 
ethane,  and  also  therefore  results  from  the  action  of  chlorine,  assisted 
by  light  and  heat,  on  ethylic  chloride,  ethylene,  and  ethylidene  di- 
chlorides,  the  chlorides  of  the  formula  C2H3C13  and  C2H2C14,  and  on 
ethinyl  pentachloride,  C2HC15,  also  by  the  repeated  action  of  alco- 
holic potassic  hydrate  and  chlorine  on  ethylene  dichloride  (§  473). 

Perchlor-ethane  forms  colourless  rhombic  crystals  of  camphorous 
odour,  which  have  sp.  gr.  2  and  boil  at  182°.  They  are  insoluble 
in  water,  but  readily  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether. 

On  passing  the  vapour  through  red-hot  tubes  it  decomposes  into 
free  chlorine  and  dicarbon  tetrachloride  : 

CCI3.CCI3  =  Cl2  +  CC12:CC12. 

Two  chlorine  atoms  are  removed  by  treatment  with  alcoholic 
potassic  sulph-hydrate  : 

CCI3.CCI3  +  2KSH  =  2KC1  +  S  +  SH2  +  CC12.CC12, 
or  with  zinc  and  sulphuric  acid. 

At  ordinary  temperatures  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  has  no  action  ; 
on  long  heating  it  yields  much  oxalate  :

together  with  ethylene  and  oxidation  products  of  the  alcohol  em- 
ployed as  a  solvent. 

Dicarbon  tetrachloride,  C2C14  =  CC12  :CC12,  perchlor  ethylene,  is 
formed  by  the  above  decompositions  of  the  hexachloride,  and  is  readily 
obtained  by  heating  the  vapour  of  carbonic  tetrachloride  (§  538).  It 
is  a  colourless,  mobile  oil,  of  sp.  gr.  1'649  at  0°,  and  boils  at  117°.  In 
sunlight  it  unites  with  two  atoms  of  chlorine,  forming  the  hexachloride, 
and  also  with  bromine,  yielding  dicarbon  tetrachlor-dibromide, 
C2Cl4Br2  =  CCl2Br.CCl2Br,  small  crystals  of  aromatic  odour,  of  sp. 
gr.  2 "3  at  21°,  which  decompose  into  their  constituents  at  200°. 

On  heating  dicarbon  tetrachloride  in  sealed  tubes  with  nitric  per- 
oxide to  110°,  they  unite  together  and  form  dinitro-tetrachlor  ethane, 
C2C14(N02)2,  a  colourless  crystalline  mass,  which  decomposes  into  its 
constituents  at  140°. 

Bromine  compounds  of  similar  constitution  and  methods  of  prepara- 
tion are  known,  as  dicarbon  hexabromide,  C2Br6  =  CBr3.CBr3,  a 
colourless,  crystalline  body,  difficultly  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether, 
readily  in  carbonic  disulphide,  and  decomposing  at  200°  without  fusion 
into  bromine  and

Dicarbon  tetrabromide,  C2Br4  =  CBr2:CBr2,  or  perbrom  ethylene, 
crystallises  in  beautiful  plates,  which  melt  at  50°.  It  is  also  formed 
by  the  decomposition  of  ethinyl  pentabroraide  by  alcoholic  potassic 
hydrate. 

Oxyhaloids. 

811.  Perchlor-ethyl  ether,  C4Cl10O  =  (CC13.CC12)20,  is  the  last  pro- 
duct of  the  action  of  chlorine,  assisted  by  light  and  heat,  on  ethylic 
ether  (comp.  §  207).  It  crystallises  in  colourless  scales  of  similar 
odour  to  chloral  and  perchlor  ethane;  it  has  sp.  gr.  1*9  at  14*5°  and 
melts  at  69°.  It  decomposes  at  300°  into  trichlor-acetylic  chloride 
and  perchlor  ethane  : 

CC18.CC12.0.CC12.CC13  =  CCI3.CO.CI  +  CCI3.CCI3. 

Perchlor-ethyl  ether  loses  four  atoms  of  chlorine  when  boiled  with  al- 
coholic potassic  sulphide,  and  is  converted  into  chloroxethose,  C4C160  : 

(CC13.CC12)20  +  2K2S  =  4KC1  +  S2  +  CC12 :  CCl.O.CCl  :CC12, 

a  colourless  liquid  of  agreeable  Spiraea-like  odour  and  sweet  taste,  of 
sp.  gr.  1*654  at  21°  and  boiling  at  210°.  It  is  insoluble  in  water,  but 
mixes  in  every  proportion  with  alcohol  and  ether. 

In  sunlight  it  combines  with  chlorine,  forming  perchlor  ether ; 
with  bromine  it  forms  crystalline  chloroxethose  tetrabromide, 
(CCl2Br.OClBr).>0,  which  melts  at  96°  and  is  resolved  into  its  com- 
ponents at  180°. 

If  the  chlorine  be  added  in  presence  of  water,  much  chloracetic 
acid  is  formed  : 

(CC12:CC1)20  +  3H20  +  2C12  =  4HC1  +  2CCl3.CO.OH. 

812.  Perchlor  ethylic  formate,  C3C1602  =  CC10.0.C2C15,  the  end 
product  of  the  action  of  chlorine  in  sunlight  on  ethylic  formate,  is  a 
colourless  oil  of  strong,  persistent  odour,  which  boils  at  about  200°. 
When  its  vapour  is  passed  through  a  tube  heated  to  redness,  it  is  de- 
composed into  tricolor  acetylic  chloride  and  carbonic  oxychloride  : 

CC13.CC12.0.CC10  =  CCI3.CO.CI  +  coci2. 

Alcohol  reacts  with  it,  forming  ethylic  trichlor  acetate  and  ethylic 
chlor-formate : 

CC13.CC12.0.CC10  +  2HO.C2H5  =  2HC1  +  CCl3.CO.O.C2H5 
+  CC10.0.C2H5. 

813.  Trichlor-acetylic  chloride,  C2C140  =  CCl3.COCl,  is  an  oil  of 
persistent  odour,  which  boils  at  118°  and  has  sp.  gr.  1*603  at  18°.  It 
deliquesces  in  air,  being  readily  decomposed  by  water  into  trichlor 
acetic  acid  and  hydrochloric  acid  : 

CC13.C0C1  +  H20  =  CCI3.CO.OH  +  HC1. 

It  can  be  obtained  from  the  latter  by  action  of  phosphoric  chloride. 

814.  Trichlor-acetic  acid,  C2C13H02  =  CCl3.CO.OH,  can  be  ob- 
tained from  acetic  acid  by  substitution,  but  is  most  readily  prepared 
by  allowing  a  mixture  of  chloral  hydrate  with  three  times  its  weight 
of  nitric  acid  to  stand  for  some  days  in  sunlight.  When  the  evolution 
of  nitrous  fumes  has  ceased,  the  mass  is  distilled  from  a  retort,  that

portion  coming  over  at  195°  being  pure  trichlor-acetic  acid.  It  solidi- 
fies in  the  cold  to  colourless  rhoniohedral  crystals,  which  melt  at52'3°. 
Its  salts  are  mostly  crystalline  and  soluble. 

Nascent  hydrogen  in  aqueous  solution  (from  potassium  amalgam 
or  electrolysis)  converts  it  into  acetic  acid  : 

(  <l3.CO.OH  +  6K  +  2H20  =  CH3.CO.OK  +  3KC1  +  2KOH. 

On  boiling  with  solution  of  potassic  hydrate  it  decomposes  into  a  car- 
bonate and  chlorofonn,  the  latter  being  readily  further  converted  into 
a  formate  : 

CCI3.CO.OK  +  HOK  =  CHCI3  +  CO(OK), 
CCI3.CO.OK  +  5HOK  =  CHO.OK  +  CO(OK)2  +  3KC1  +  2H20. 

Boiling  aqueous  ammonia  only  produces  the  decomposition  shown  in 
the  first  equation. 

Ethylic  tr'ichlor-acetate,  CC13.C0.0.02H5,  obtained  either  by  satur-

or  distillation  with  sulphuric  acid,  or  by  the  action  of  trichlor  acetylic 
chloride  on  alcohol,  is  a  colourless  oil  boiling  at  164°. 

Ammonia  converts  it  into  alcohol  and  trichlor-acetamnl', 
CC13.C0.NH2,  which  crystallises  in  nacreous  plates,  melts  at  136°, 
and  boils  at  239°.  On  heating  with  water  to  100°  it  decomposes  into 
ammonic carbonate  and  chloroform.

Perchlor  eihy  ,  C4C180,  =  CCI3  C0.0.CC12.CC13,  is  the 

product  of  the  complete  chlorination  of  ethylic  acetate.  It  is  a  colour- 
less liquid  of  chloral-like  odour,  boiling  at  245°  and  having  a  sp.  gr. 
of  1*79  at  25°.  It  is  partly  decomposed  on  distillation,  completely  on 
passing  through  a  red-hot  tube,  yielding  two  molecules  of  trichlor 
acetylic  chloride  : 

CC13.C0.0.CC12.CC13  =  2CCI3.COCI. 

815.  Tribrom-acetic  acid,  C2Br302H  =  CBr3.CO.OH,  is  formed 
by  oxidation  of  bromal  (§  778)  with  strong  nitric  acid.  It  is  crys- 
talline, melts  at  135°,  and  boils  at  250°.  On  boiling  its  potassic  salt 
with  potassic  hydrate,  it  yields  bromoform  and  potassic  carbonate. 

Tribrom-acetylic  bromide,  CBr3.COBr,  is  obtained  by  heating 
dibrom-acetylic  bromide  (§  779)  with  bromine  to  200°  in  sealed  tubes. 
It  is  a  yellowish  liquid,  which  boils  somewhat  above  220°,  fumes  in 
air,  and  yields  tribrom-acetic  acid  with  water. 

Trisubstituted  Aceto-nitriles. 

816.  Fulminates. — In  presence  of  mercury  or  silver  salts  alcohol 
gives,  on  oxidation  with  nitric  acid  containing  some  nitrous  acid,  a 
crystalline  explosive  precipitate  of  the  so-termed  fulminates  of  silver 
and  mercury.     These  have  the  same  composition  as  the  cyanates  of

those  metals,  but  though  having  double  the  molecular  weight,  are  not 
salts  of  a  dicyanic  acid,  but  from  their  products  of  decomposition 
would  appear  to  be  derivatives  of  aceto-nitrile  (§  547)  in  which  one 
hydrogen  atom  has  been  replaced  by  nitryl  (N02),  the  two  others  by 
metal. 

Mercuric  fulminate,  fulminating  mercury,  C2N2Hg02,  is  mercury 
nitro-acetonitrile,  CHg(N02).CN.  To  prepare  this  compound  1  part 
of  mercury  is  dissolved  in  12  parts  of  nitric  acid  of  sp.  gr.  l-36,  and 
5J  parts  of  90  %  alcohol  is  then  poured  into  the  solution.  As  soon 
as  the  mixture  is  in  violent  reaction  6  parts  more  of  alcohol  are 
added  slowly,  to  moderate  the  reaction.  At  first  the  mixture  blackens, 
from  separation  of  mercury,  but  this  soon  vanishes  and  is  succeeded 
by  crystalline  flocks  of  mercuric  fulminate,  which  fall  to  the  bottom  of 
the  vessel.  During  the  reaction  large  quantities  of  volatile  oxidation 
products  of  alcohol,  such  as  aldehyde,  ethylic  nitrate,  <fec,  are  evolved 
from  the  boiling  liquid,  whilst  others,  such  as  glycollicacid,  remain  in 
solution.  The  mercuric  fulminate  is  then  crystallised  from  hot  water. 
It  forms  white,  silky,  delicate  needles,  which  are  difficultly  soluble  in 
cold  water.  In  the  dry  state  it  is  extremely  explosive,  detonating  on 
heating  or  by  friction  or  percussion,  as  also  on  contact  with  con- 
centrated sulphuric  acid.  It  is  used,  mixed  with  potassic  nitrate,  for 
filling  percussion  caps. 

On  adding  copper  or  zinc  to  a  hot  saturated  solution  of  the  salt, 
metallic  mercury  separates,  and  readily  soluble  zincic  or  cupric  ful- 
minate is  formed. 

Argentic  fulminate,  fulminatlwj  silver,  C2N202Ag2,  diargento- 
nitro-acetonitrile,  C(N02)  Ag2.CN,  is  prepared  in  similar  manner  to  the 
mercury  compound.  It  separates  in  fine  white  needles,  which  dissolve 
in  36  parts  of  boiling  water  and  are  very  difficultly  soluble  in  cold 
water.  At  above  100°,  or  on  the  weakest  blow,  fulminating  silver 
explodes  with  fearful  violence,  even  when  covered  with  water. 

On  adding  pota,ssic  chloride  to  a  boiling  solution  of  argentic  ful- 
minate as  long  as  a  precipitate  of  argentic  chloride  forms,  there  is 
obtained  on  evaporation  brilliant  white  plates,  of  very  explosive  nature, 
of  potassic  "/•</<  itt 'a'  fvlin'i 'note,  C(NO  ^>  from  whose  aqueous 

solution  nitric  acid  precipitates  a  white  powder  of  hydric  argentic  ful- 
minate, C(N02)HAg.CN. 

817.  All  attempts  to  prepare  nitro-acetonitrile,  C(N02)H2.CN, from 
the  fulminates  have  failed.  On  passing  sulphuretted  hydrogen  through 
an  aqueous  solution  of  mercuric  fulminate,  mercuric  sulphide  is  pre- 
cipitated, but  at  the  same  time  carbonic  anhydride  is  evolved,  and  the 
solution  contains  ammonic  sulpho-cyanate  : 

C(N02)Hg.CN  +-  2H2S  =  HgS  +  C02  +  (NH4)S.CN. 

Chlorine  gas  decomposes  mercuric  fulminate  into  mercuric  chloride, 
chlorpicrin  (§  542),  and  cyanogen  chloride  : 

C(N02)Hg.CN  +  3C12  =  HgCl2  +  C(N02)C13  +  C1CN, 

whilst  bromine  in  the  presence  of  water  removes  the  metal,  taking  its 
place  and  yielding  dibrom  nitro-acetonitrile  : 

C(N02)Hg.CN  +  2Br2  =  HgBr2  +  C(N02)Br2.CN. 

Dibrom   nitro-acetonitrile  crystallises  from  ether  and  alcohol  in 


FULMINURIC  ACID.  479 

well-formed  crystals  insoluble  in  water.  It  melts  at  50°,  and  com- 
mences to  boil  with  decomposition  at  130°. 

Iodine  acts  like  bromine  and  yields  colourless  monoclinic  prisms  of 
diiodnitro-acetonitrile,  C(N02)L>.CN,  which  melt  at  86°  with  partial 
decomposition. 

818.  Fulminuric  Acid. — By  boiling  mercuric  fulminate  with 
aqueous  solutions  of  alkaline  haloids,  mercuric  haloids  and  fulminurates 
are  formed.  Most  usually  amnionic  chloride  is  employed  to  effect  the 
decomposition;  the  solution  is  mixed  with  ammonia  to  precipitate  the 
mercury  as  white  precipitate,  and  amnionic  fulminurate  : 

C3N3(NH4)H203, 

obtained  by  evaporating  the  filtrate.  If  potassic  chloride  be  employed 
instead  of  amnionic  chloride,  potassic  fulminurate  is  obtained  in  brilliant 
prisms.  A  solution  of  the  ammonic  salt  gives  with  basic  plumbic 
acetate  a  white  precipitate  of  plumbic  fulminurate.  If  this  latter  be 
suspended  in  water  and  decomposed  with  sulphuretted  hydrogen, 
plumbic  sulphide  is  precipitated  and  fulminuric  acid,  C3N3H3O3,  re- 
mains in  solution,  and  is  left  on  evaporation  in  the  form  of  a  strongly 
acid  syrup,  which,  on  complete  drying,  solidifies  to  a  crystalline  mass. 
This  latter  decomposes  with  slight  explosion  when  heated. 

A  mixture  of  strong  sulphuric  and  nitric  acids  converts  fulminuric 
acid  into 

819.  Trinitro-acetonitriL*,  C2N406  =  C(N02)3.CN,  a  colourless, 
camphor-like,  crystalline  mass,  inciting  at  41"5°  ;  it  detonates  violently 
at  220°,  and  is  converted  into  carbonic  anhydride  and  the  ammonium 
compound  of  nitroform  by  water  or  alcohol  at  ordinary  temperatures 
(§  541). 

Sulphuretted  hydrogen  converts  trinitro-acetonitrile  into  ammon- 
dinitro-acetonitrile  : 

C(N02)3.CN  +  4H2S  =  S4  +  2H20  +  C(NO,)2(NH4).CN, 

crystallising  in  brilliant  colourless  needles,  readily  soluble  in  water, 
and  which  volatilise  markedly  with  evolution  of  irritating  fumes  at 
100°.  Dilute  sulphuric  acid  forms  with  it  ammonic  sulphate  and 
dinitro-acetonitrile,  C(N02)2H.CN,  forming  large  tables,  and  when 
treated  with  potassic  hydrate  it  yields  jwtassium  dinitro-acetonitrile, 
C(N02)2K.CN,  with  nitric  acid  again  yields  trinitro-acetonitrile. 

The  formation  of  trinitro-acetonitriles  from  fulminuric  acid  would 
characterise  the  latter  as  a  dicarbon  compound ;  neither  its  constitution 
nor  molecular  weight,  however,  can  yet  be  settled. 

Trichlor-acetonitrih,  C2C13.N  =  CC13.CN,  is  formed  by  heating 
trichlor  acetamide  with  phosphoric  anhydride,  as  an  oil  of  penetrating 
odour,  boiling  at  83°-84°  and  of  sp.  gr.  1-439.

of  different  varieties  of  Oxalis  and  Rumex,  as  sodium  salts  in  Salsola

plant  cells,  e.g.  rhubarb,  &c. ;  in  the  urine  of  men  and  animals  it  also 
often  occurs,  sometimes  forming  concretions  in  the  bladder.  It  may-

A  common  method  of  preparation  is  by  the  oxidation  of  sugar  by 
nitric  acid,  1  part  sugar  and  8  parts  nitric  acid,  sp.  gr.  l-38,  being 
heated  together ;  after  evaporating  the  excess  of  nitric  acid,  the  oxalic 
crystallises  out  and  may  be  purified  by  recrystallisation  from  water. 
On  the  large  scale  it  is  obtained  by  melting  some  cheap  form  of 
cellulose — e.g.  wood  shavings,  sawdust — with  a  mixture  of  caustic 
potash  and  soda.  On  treatment  of  the  fused  mass  with  a  little  cold 
water  sodic  oxalate  remains  for  the  most  part  undissolved. 

The  acid  crystallises  from  its  aqueous  solution  in  colourless  prisms 
of  the  probable  formula  : 

C(OH)3 

C(OH)3 

which  dissolve  in  9  parts  cold  water  and  2-|  parts  of  alcohol,  and  are 
very  soluble  in  the  boiling  liquids.  The  crystals  lose  water  in  dry 
air,  or  at  a  temperature  of  100°,  and  then  have  the  composition 
H2C204.  It  sublimes  if  carefully  heated  to  150°  in  fine  white 
needles.  By  very  quickly  heating  complete  decomposition  may  be 
brought  about,  thus  : 

HO.CO.CO.OH  =  C02  +  HCO.OH  or  =  C02  +  CO  +  H20. 

The  latter  products  alone  result  when  it  is  heated  with  sulphuric 
acid.  With  glycerine  much  formic  acid  (§  567)  is  produced,  some  of 
the   glycerine  being  reduced  to  allylic  alcohol  (§  663).     Oxidising

821.  Oxalates. — Oxalic  acid  is  a  strong  dibasic  acid,  and  gives 
with  the  alkali  metals  neutral  and  acid  salts,  and  even  salts  with 

188  of  acid  (§  575).  Most  of  the  other  metallic  salts  are  very  in- 
soluble, and  are  decomposed  by  strong  mineral  acids.  The  following 
selections  must  suffice  as  examples  of  the  very  numerous  oxalates 
known  : — 

J)ipotassic  oxalate,  K2C204,OH2 ;  forms  monclinic  prisms  easily 
soluble.  Ilydric  potastie  oxalate,  KHC204,OH2 ;  forms  rhombic 
prisms  very  difficultly  soluble.  Fotassic  quadroxalat  • .  KH<\204, 
H2C204,2H20,  commonly  called  Baits  of  sorrel,  crystallises  in  anor- 
thic  forms  and  dissolves  in  twenty  parts  water  at  20°.  Two  amnionic 
salts  are  known  isomorphic  with  the  potassic  salts.  Calcium  oxalate, 
CaC204.OH2,  or  with  30H2,  is  obtained  as  a  white  amorphous  pre- 
cipitate quite  insoluble  in  water  and  acetic  acid.  In  the  cells  of  some 
plants  and  in  urinary  deposits  it,  however,  sometimes  forms  crystals 
belonging  to  the  rhombic  system.  Its  last  molecule  of  water  may  be 
expelled  at  200°.  The  oxalates  of  mercury  and  silver  are  also  white 
precipitates,  which,  when  dried  and  heated,  explode  very  violently, 
decomposing  into  metal  and  C02. 

822.  Ethereal  Salts  of  Oxalic  Acid. — Neutral  and  acid  salts  are 
known.  The  neutral  are  best  obtained  by  long-continued  heating  of 
the  particular  alcohol  with  dried  oxalic  acid.  They  are  decomposed 
even  by  cold  water  into  the  alcohol  and  acid,  and  also  by  alkalies. 
On  heating  with  zinc  and  alkyl  iodides  they  yield  the  alkyl  salts  of 
tertiary  alcoholic  acids  (§  705,  8) ;  by  the  action  of  potassium,  the  salts 
of  carbonic  acid  (§  22S). 

Dimethylic  oxalate,  (CH3).2C204,  prepared  by  distilling  equal  parts 
oxalic  acid,  methyl  alcohol,  and  sulphuric  acid,  forms  nacreous  crys- 
tals of  fusing  point  51°,  boiling  at  162°, 

Diethylic  oxalate,  (C2H5)2C2C4,  may  be  prepared  in  a  similar 
manner  to  the  above,  and  also  by  saturating  a  solution  of  oxalic  acid 
in  absolute  alcohol  with  HC1  gas  and  distilling.  It  is  a  mobile, 
colourless  liquid  of  faint  odour,  boiling  at  186°,  and  of  sp.  gr.  1*0824 
at  15°. 

Dipropyl  oxalate,  (CH3.CH2.CH2)2C204,  boils  at  209°-211°?  sp.  gr. 
1-018. 

Diisobutyl  oxalate,  [(CH3)2  :CH.CH9]2C204,  boils  at  224°-226°, 
sp.  gr.  =  1-002. 

Salts  of  oxalic  acid  of  the  form  (CnH2n  +  1)HC204  are  scarcely

known  in  the  free  state.  They  decompose  with  great  rapidity  in  con- 
tact with  water.  Their  potassic  salts  may,  however,  be  obtained  as 
crystalline  precipitates,  e.g.  potassic  ethylic  oxalate,  (C2H5)K.C204. 

823.  Potassic  ethylic  oxalate,  when  acted  upon  by  phosphor  oxy- 
chloride,  gives  ethyl-oxal  cldoride ;  thus  :

a  liquid  boiling  at  140°,  of  sp.  gr.  1*216,  and  fuming  strongly  in  moist 
air.  Water  converts  it  into  oxalic  acid  and  ethylic  chloride ;  with 
alcohol  it  forms  the  neutral  salt 

824.  Oxalyl  Diamides. — The  neutral  ethereal  salts  of  oxalic  acid 
are  very  easily  converted  by  aqueous  ammonia  into  the  double  amide 
of  the  acid,  oxamide,  C2H4N202  : 

CO.O.C2H5  CO.NH2 

+  2NH3  =   I  +  2HO.C2H5

The  same  body  also  results  from  the  action  of  aldehyde  on  an  aqueous 
solution  of  cyanogen  :

also  by  the  oxidation  of  hydrocyanic  acid  with  hydric  peroxide  : 

2HCN  +  H202  =  C202(NH2)2. 

Oxamide  is  a  white  powder  which  requires  about  10,000  times  its 
weight  of  cold  water  for  solution.  It  is  taken  up  more  freely  by  a 
hot  saturated  solution  of  calcic  chloride,  from  which  it  crystallises  in 
needles  on  cooling.  It  sublimes  unchanged  on  careful  heating.  Heated 
with  water  to  200°,  it  is  converted  into  neutral  amnionic  oxalate. 

Alkyl  oxalates  are  converted  by  alkylamines  into  dialkyl 
oxamides. 

Dimethyl  oxamide,  C202(N.CH3.H)2,  crystallises  in  needles 
soluble  in  hot  water. 

Diethyl  oxamide,  C202(N.C2H5.H)2,  is  very  similar. 

825.  Acid  Amides. — By  heating  acid  ammonic  oxalate  until 
carbonic  anhydride  begins  to  be  evolved  a  mixture  of  oxamide  and 
oxamic  acid  is  left,  from  which  the  latter  can  be  extracted  by  water : 

CO.O.NH4  CO.NH2 

=  OH2  +    I  (oxamic  acid) 

CO.OH  CO.OH 

By  evaporating  its  solution  it  may  be  obtained  as  a  pulverulent  sub- 
stance of  acid  reaction,  soluble  in  58  parts  of  water  at  18°.  It  melts 
at  173°  and  decomposes  at  the  same  time  into  water,  formic  acid,  and 
oxamide.  It  recombines,  when  boiled  with  water,  to  acid  ammonic 
oxalate.  It  acts  towards  metals  as  a  monobasic  acid  and  yields  crys- 
talline salts. 

Ethereal  oxamates  may  be  prepared  by  acting  on  neutral  ethereal 
salts  of  oxalic  acid  with  alcoholic  ammonia  until  oxamide  begins  to

precipitate.  Ethyl-oxal  chloride  also  reacts  with  ammonia  to  form 
ethvlic  oxamate  : 

Cl.CO.CO.O.C,H8  +  NH3  =  NH4C1  +  NH2.CO.CO.O.C2H5. 

Ethylxc  oxamate  is  best  known.  It  crystallises  in  nacreous 
leaves,  soluble  in  water  and  alcohol,  and  converted  by  ammonia  into 
oxamide. 

Isomeric    with   these  ethereal  salts  are  the  alhjl  oxamic  adds,

Ethyl-oxamic     acid,     Qfitrfiw*  »    forms     six-sided    tables

EtliyUc  dirtltyl-oxamate,  CjOj'q  V,  W  *'* ,  is  obtained  by  re- 
action between  ethylic  oxalate  and  diethylamine  (§  262)  as  a  liquid 
boiling  at  254°.  It  gives  a  soluble  salt  with  calcic  hydrate,  from 
which  the  free  acid  can  be  obtained  by  precipitation  of  the  calcium 
with  oxalic  acid.

Parabanic  acid  forms  anhydrous,  broad,  colourless  prisms,  which

A  solution  of  parabanic  acid  gives  with  argentic  nitrate  solution,

crystallising  in  large  shining  rhombohedra.  It  dissolves  in  three 
parts  cold  water  and  cannot  be  sublimed.  It  was  first  discovered 
amongst  the  oxidation  products  of  caffeine: 

On  treating  parabanic  acid  with  aqueous  alkalies  salts  of  oxaluric 
acid,  isomeric  with  parabanic  hydrate,  are  produced. 

827.  Oxaluric  acid,  C3H4N204,  is  related  to  parabanic  acid  in  the 
same  manner  that  hydantoic  acid  is  to  hydantoin  (§  724).  Oxaluric 
acid,  or  ammonic  oxalurate,  is  most  readily  obtained  by  warming  a 
solution  of  parabanic  acid  with  ammonia  : 

CO  NH'  |  °  +  NH3  +  OH2  =  CONH.CO.CO.O.NH4 
.NH.CO  JN±±2 

On  acidifying  with  a  mineral  acid  the  oxaluric  acid  is  separated  as  a 
white,  difficultly  soluble  acid  powder. 

The  ammonic  salt  is  found  in  small  amount  in  urine.  Silver 
solutions  yield  a  precipitate  of  argentic  oxalurate  :  C3H3AgN204, 
silky  needles  soluble  in  hot  water.  POCl3  warmed  with  oxaluric 
acid  reproduces  parabanic  acid. 

Ethylic  oxalurate  is  formed  by  the  reaction  at  ordinary  tempera- 
tures between  ethyl-oxal  chloride  (§  823)  and  urea  : 

C2H5.O.CO.CO.Cl  +  NH,.CO.NH2  =  HC1 
+  C2H5.O.CO.CO.N~H.CO.NH2. 

It  crystallises  in  silky  needles,  only  slightly  soluble  in  alcohol,  ether, 
or  water  in  the  cold.  It  melts  between  160°  and  170°  and  decom-

The  solution  is  exactly  neutralised  with  sulphuric  acid  evaporated  to  a 
small  bulk,  when  an  excess  of  strong  acid  La  added,  and  the  cyanacetic 
acid  extracted  by  shaking  out  with  ether.  The  acid  is  further  puri- 
fied by  conversion  into  the  plumbic  salt,  and  decomposing  this  with 
hydric  sulphide.  Salts  of  this  acid  are  all  soluble,  with  the  exception 
of  those  of  mercury  and  silver.  Cyanacetic  acid  is  the  half-nitrile  of 
malonic  acid,  into  which  it  is  easily  converted  by  boiling  with  alkali.

careful  oxidation  of  malic  acid  by  potassic  dichromate  solution,  and 
from  ethylene  lactic  acid. 

It  crystallises  in  large  plates,  easily  soluble  in  water  and  alcohol,

The  alkali  salts  only  of  this  acid  are  easily  soluble  in  water. 
The  baric  salt,  CH2  :(CO.O)2Ba,H20,  crystallises  in  groups  of 
needles ;  the  calcic  salt,  of  similar  appearance,  is  extremely  difficultly 
soluble  in  water,  the  argentic  and  plumbic  salts  quite  insoluble. 

Barbituric  acid,  or  malonyl  urea,  CH2  :(CO.NH)2  :C0,  will  be 
considered  under  the  derivatives  of  uric  acid. 

Compounds  of  the  Radical  C2H4 -.(CEE)^ 

831.  The  hydrocarbon  radical,  C2H4 :  (CEE)2,  exists  in  two  isomeric 

forms,  accordingly  as  the  group  C2H4  occurs  as  ethylene  or  ethylidene. 

CO  OTT 
The  dibasic  acid,  C2H4'p^'^-p-,    is    termed   succinic    acidy    and    is 

known  in  two  forms,  ordinary  succinic  and  iso-succinic  acid. 

Iso-succinic  or  ethylidene  dicarboxylic  acid,  CH3.CH  :(CO.OH)2,  is

obtained,  similarly  to  malonic  acid,  from  the  a-halogen  compounds  of 
propionic  acid  :

CO.OK 

Potassic  cyano-propionate. 
This  latter  body,  which  has  not  yet  been  isolated  in  a  pure  state,  is 
boiled  with  potassic  hydrate  until  ammonia  ceases  to  be  evolved,  and 
the  acid  separated  from  the  potassic  salt  after  the  method  indicated 
for  malonic  acid. 

Iso-succinic  acid  forms  colourless  crystals,  subliming  at  100°, 
melting  at  130°,  and  decomposing  at  150°  into  propionic  and  carbonic 
acids.  This  decomposition  is  determined  by  the  fact  that  both  CO. OH 
groups  are  combined  in  iso-succinic  as  in  malonic  acid  to  one  carbon 
atom.     It  may  therefore  be  termed  Diethyl  malonic  acid. 

The  salts  resemble  those  of  malonic  acid.  It  dissolves  in  5  parts 
water  at  ordinary  temperature.

CH2.CO.OH 

833.  Succinic   acid,  ethylene  dicarboxylic  acid,  |  ,     is 

CH2.CO.OH 
found  in  amber,  in  wormwood  and  mountain  ash  berries  (Sorbus 
aucuparia),  and  in  many  animal  fluids.  It  is  a  regular  product  of 
the  alcoholic  fermentation  of  sugar  and  of  the  oxidation  of  fatty  acids 
of  high  molecular  weight.  It  is  also  formed  by  reduction  of  malic 
and  tartaric  acids,  either  by  hydriodic  acid  or  fermentation,  and  by 
the  action  of  nascent  hydrogen  in  maleic  and  fumaric  acids. 

Succinic  acid  is  obtained  on  a  large  scale  by  the  distillation  of 
waste  amber  in  iron  retorts.  The  distillate  is  evaporated  and  boiled 
with  nitric  acid  to  destroy  colouring  matters,  and  crystallised  from 
water. 

It  is  also  obtained  by  the  fermentation  of  malic  acid  in  alkaline 
solution  by  means  of  old  cheese.  The  mixture  of  crude  calcic  malate, 
old  cheese,  and  water  is  allowed  to  stand  for  some  days  at  30°  or  40°, 
after  which  the  precipitate  is  decomposed  with  sulphuric  acid. 


SUCCINIC  ACID.  487 

Succinic  acid  forms  colourless  monoclinic  prisms,  soluble  in  17 
parts  of  water  at  18°,  in  3  parts  at  100°.  It  begins  to  sublime  at 
120°,  and  melts  about  180°.  It  decomposes  into  anhydride  and  water 
at  -235°. 

By  electrolysis  carbonic  acid,  hydrogen,  and  ethylene  are  produced. 
In  contact  with  uranium  salts  in  sunlight  it  splits  up  into  carbonic 
and  propionic  acids.  The  same  reaction  takes  place  when  it  is  fused 
with  alkalies. 

Succinates  of  the  alkalies  are  all  easily  soluble ;  salts  with  other 
metals  are  difficultly  soluble  or  insoluble  in  water.  Calcic  suc- 
cinate is  somewhat  soluble,  and  may  be  obtained  in  crystals,

molecule  of  water  in  rhombic  tabular  crystals,  melting  at  125°-126° 
and  boiling  at  287°-288°.     It  also  sublimes  in  colourless  needles.

Derivatives  of  the  Hexavalext  Alcohol  Radicals,  CnH2n_4. 

846.  In  the  hexhydric  alcohols,  CnH2n_4(OH)6,  the  six  hydroxyl 
groups  are  united  to  six  different  carbon  atoms,  so  that  there  must  be 
at  least  a  hexacarbon  nucleus.  So  far  only  derivatives  of  isomeric 
radicals,  C6H8,  are  known. 

Mannite,  C6H8(OH)6. 

847.  Mannite  is  very  widely  disseminated  in  the  vegetable 
kingdom.  It  occurs  in  the  leaves  of  Syringia  vulgaris  and  Ligustrum 
vulgare,  in  numerous  bulbs,  as  in  those  of  Cyclamen  europaeum  and 
celery,  in  fungi  and  sea- weeds,  in  the  sap  of  the  larch,  the  bark  of 
Canella  alba,  the  exuded  sap  of  apple  and  cherry  trees,  limes,  kc.  It 
occurs  in  large  quantity  in  the  sap  of  Fraxinus  Ornus,  which  in  the 
dry  state  forms  commercial  manna.  It  is  prepared  artificially  from 
grape  sugar  by  the  action  of  the  hydrogen  evolved  by  sodium  amalgam, 
or  by  reducing  fermentations,  as  in  the  so-called  mucous  and  butyric 
fermentations  of  sugar. 

It  is  most  readily  obtained  from  manna.  This  is  dissolved  in  half 
its  weight  of  boiling  water,  some  albumin  added  in  order  to  clarify  it, 
and  filtered  through  a  thick  cloth.  The  mass  which  solidifies  on 
cooling  is  pressed  and  obtained  colourless  by  repeated  fine  division  in 


492     DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  HEXAD  ALCOHOL  RADICALS,  CnH^.*. 

water  and  pressing.  Mannite  can  also  be  obtained  pure  by  extracting 
manna  with  hot  alcohol  and  crystallisation  of  the  solution. 

Mannite  crystallises  from  alcohol  in  fine  silky  needles,  from  water 
in  large,  transparent,  rhombic  prisms.  It  dissolves  in  65  parts 
of  water  at  16°,  very  readily  at  100°.  It  is  difficultly  soluble  in  cold, 
readily  in  boiling  alcohol,  insoluble  in  ether.  Its  taste  is  intensely 
sweet;  its  melting  point  is  above  160°.  With  metallic  oxides  it 
yields  compounds  in  which  a  part  of  the  hydroxylic  hydrogen  atoms 
have  been  replaced  by  metals  (comp.  glycerin,  §  676). 

On  keeping  a  solution  of  mannite  mixed  with  chalk  and  putrid 
cheese  at  a  temperature  not  exceeding  40°,  a  fermentation  occurs,  in 
which  lactic,  butyric,  and  acetic  acids  and  some  alcohol  are  formed. 
By  gentle  oxidation,  as  by  the  standing  of  an  aqueous  solution  with 
platinum  black,  it  is  first  converted  into  a  fermentable  sugar, 
mannitose,  C6H8(OH)6  +  O  =  H20  +  C6H7(OH)t50,  closely  re- 
sembling fruit  sugar,  and  from  which,  by  further  addition  of  oxygen, 
mannitic  acid,  C6H1207,  is  obtained.  This  latter  yields  saccharic  acid 
on  boiling  with  nitric  acid,  as  also  does  mannite. 

On  heating  mannite  with  concentrated  hydriodic  acid,  secondary 
normal  hexylic  iodide  is  formed  (§  195).  It  follows  from  this  that 
mannite  must  be  considered  as  a  derivative  of  normal  hexane,  and  has 
the  structural  formula : 

CH2(OH).CH(OH).CH(OH).CH(OH).CH(CH).CH2(OH). 

848.  Haloid  Derivatives  of  Mannite. — By  heating  mannite  to 
100°  with  a  large  excess  of  concentrated  hydrochloric  or  hydrobromic 
acid,  two  hydroxyl  groups  are  replaced  by  halogen  atoms.  There  are 
thus  formed  dihaloid  tetrahydrates  of  the  mannite  radical  (mannyl), 
which  can  be  obtained  in  crystals  by  evaporation  of  the  solution  under 
a  bell  jar,  in  which  are  placed  vessels  containing  potassic  hydrate 
and  sulphuric  acid. 

Mannite  dicldor-hydr'm,  C6H8CL,(OH)4,  forms  long  colourless 
plates  melting  with  evolution  of  hydrochloric  acid  at  174°  ;  they 
dissolve  in  water,  but  are  nearly  or  quite  insoluble  in  alcohol  or  ether. 

Mannite  dibrom-hydrin,  C6H8Br2(OH)4,  is  very  similar  to  the  fore- 
going, but  is  insoluble  in  water  and  melts  with  decomposition  at  178°. 

849.  Mannite  Salts. — As  a  hexavalent  alcohol  mannite  reacts  with 
strong  mineral  acids  and  the  anhydrides  of  organic  acids,  yielding 
salts  of  mannite,  of  which  only  few  have  been  prepared  in  a  state  of 
purity. 

Ma 'unite  nitrate,  C6H8!N"6018  =  C6H8(O.N02)G,  nitro-mannite,  or 
mannyl  hcxanitrate,  is  obtained  by  dissolving  mannite  in  cold  con- 
centrated nitric  acid,  and  separates  in  crystals  on  addition  of  concen- 
trated sulphuric  acid  : 

C6H8(OH)6  +  6HO.N02  +  6H2S04  =  C6H8(O.N02)6  +  6H4S05. 

This  body  is  insoluble  in  cold  water,  but  is  readily  dissolved  by 
boiling  alcohol  and  by  ether,  and  separates  from  these  solvents  in  fine 
silky  needles,  which  melt  at  108°.  It  burns  with  detonation  at  120° 
and  explodes  violently  under  a  short  powerful  blow : 

C6H8(ON02)6  =  6C02  +  4H20  +  3N2  +  02. 

Mannite  sulplturic  acid,  CGH8(OH)3(O.S02.OH)3(?),  is  a  liydric 


MANNITE.  493 

basic  mannyl  .sulphate.  It  is  prepared  by  dissolving  mannitein  strong 
sulphuric  acid,  and  is  separated  in  similar  manner  to  ethysulphuric 
acid  (§  216),  glycol,  and  glycerin  sulphuric  acids  (§§  518  and  690).  As 
a  strong  acid  it  can  exchange  three  atoms  of  hydrogen  for  metal,  and 
yields  readily  soluble,  difficultly  crystallisable  salts  : 

C6H8(OH)3(O.S02.OM)3. 

The  free  acid  is  decomposed  by  water  into  dilute  sulphuric  acid  and 
mannite. 

Salts  of  organic  acids  cannot  be  prepared,  as  in  the  case  of 
glycerin,  by  heating  mannite  with  organic  acids,  as  at  the  same  time 
water  is  eliminated  with  formation  of  mannitan  salts.  Normal 
organic  salts  of  mannite  are  obtained  by  long  heating  of  mannite  with 
the  anhydrides  of  organic  acids;    there  is  thus  obtained,  e.g.  : 

C6H8(OH)6  +  6(C2H30)20  =  6HO.C2H30  +  C6H8(O.C.2H30)6, 

Mannyl  Acetate. — This  crystallises  in  white  granules,  which  are 
little  soluble  in  cold  water,  more  readily  in  boiling  water  and  alcohol, 
and  melt  at  about  100°. 

850.  MarmUan,  <  \~H.X2Ob  =  C6H8(OH)40,  or  inannyl- oxide  tetra- 
hydrate,  is  prepared  from  mannite  with  direct  elimination  of  a  mole- 
cule of  water  by  beating  to  200°,  and  is  also  formed  by  long  boiling 
with  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid.  Mannitan  is  a  scarcely  liquid 
syrup  of  strongly  sweet  taste,  which  is  niiscible  with  water  and 
alcohol,  insoluble  in  ether.  By  long  contact  with  water,  as  by  stand- 
ing in  moist  air,  or  more  quickly  by  boiling  with  baryta  water,  it 
takes  up  a  molecule  of  water  and  is  reconverted  into  mannite. 

Halogen  derivatives  of  mannitan  are  formed  from  the  mannyl 
dihaloid  tetrahydrates  by  boiling  with  water  ;  e.g. 

C6H8C12(0H)4  =  HC1  +  C6H80(0H)3C1. 

In  addition  to  mannitan  chlorhydrin,  the  corresponding  mannitan 
dibromhydrin,  ( ,,iH8.0(OH3)Br,  is  also  known.  Both  are  crystalline 
bodies  soluble  in  water,  which  melt  below  100°  and  are  converted 
into  mannitan  on  long  boiling  with  water  : 

C6H80(0H)3C1  +  H20  =  HC1  +  C6H8(OH)40. 

In  the  preparation  of  mannitan  from  mannite,  by  long  boiling  with 
hydrochloric  acid,  this  chloride  is  without  doubt  formed  as  an  inter- 
mediate product. 

,S(ilts  of  mannitan  with  organic  acids  are  formed  by  the  long 
heating  of  the  latter  with  mannite  at  200°-250°.  The  first  products 
are  diacid  salts,  from  which,  by  similar  treatment,  the  normal  tetra- 
acid  salts  are  obtained.  The  following  are  some  of  the  salts  prepared  : — 

Mannitan  diacetate,  C6H80(O.C2H30).,(OH).,,  the  dihutyrate, 
C6H80(O.C4H70)2(OH)2,  and  tetrabutyrate]  C6H80(O.C4H70)4,  all 
three  liquids  soluble  in  ether.  Palmitates  and  stearates  have  also 
been  obtained  as  fatty  masses. 

851.  Dulcite,  or  melampyrite,  C6H1406  =  C6H8(OH)6,  occurs  in 
the  sap  of  numerous  plants,  such  as  Melampyrum  nemorosum,  Scro- 
phularia  nodosa,  Evonymus  europaeus,  &c.  It  occurs  in  largest 
quantity  in  the  so-called  dulcit  manna  from  Madagascar,   prepared 


494     DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  BEXAD  ALCOHOL  RADICALS,  CnH,n_4. 

from  plants  not  yet  determined,  and  is  obtained  therefrom  by  crystal- 
lisation from  a  hot  aqueous  solution. 

Synthetically  dulcite  has  been  obtained  by  addition  of  hydrogen 
to  lactose,  by  treatment  of  a  solution  of  the  latter  with  sodium 
amalgam. 

Dulcite  crystallises  in  large  monoclinic  prisms,  melting  at  188°- 
190°,  which  require  38  parts  of  water  at  14°  for  solution.  It  is  but 
little  soluble  in  alcohol.  By  oxidation  with  nitric  acid  it  yields 
mucic  acid.  The  chemical  behaviour  of  dulcite  is  very  similar  to  that 
of  mannite. 

By  heating  with  hydrochloric  or  hydrobromic  acids  it  gives 
dihaloid  tetrahydrates,  crystallising  in  plates,  which  are  but  little 
soluble  in  water,  and  of  which  C6H8C12(0H)4  melts  with  decomposi- 
tion at  180°. 

With  nitric  and  sulphuric  acids  dulcite  yields  nitrodulcite, 
C6H8(O.N02)6.  By  heating  to  180°  with  four  times  its  weight  of 
acetic  anhydride  it  gives  the  hexacetate,  C6H8(O.C2H30)6,  crystallis- 
ing in  small  brittle  plates,  melting  at  171°.  Heated  to  solution  with 
1^  part  of  acetic  anhydride  and  some  glacial  acetic  acid,  dulcite 
yields  scales  of  a  diacetate,  C6H8(OH)2(O.C2H30)2,  melting  at  176°  ; 
with  acetic  acid  only  it  gives  the  dulcitan  salts  : 

C6H80(OH)2(O.C2H30)2, 

as  an  oily  liquid,  and  C6H80(O.C2H30)4  as  a  very  bitter,  resinous 
mass.  By  heating  the  latter  with  a  molecule  of  acetic  anhydride  it 
is  transformed  into  the  hexacetate  of  dulcite. 

Ohlor-acetyl  converts  dulcite  into  the  crystalline  pentacetate 
chloride,  C6H8C1(0.C2H30)5,  converted  by  water  into 

C6H8(OH)(O.C2H30)5, 

crystallising  in  needles  of  melting  point  165°. 

852.  A  third  isomeric  of  mannite,  sorbite,  C6H1206,  occurs  in  the 
berries  of  the  mountain  ash  (Sorbus  aucuparia),  and  is  found,  as  it  is 
not  fermentable,  in  the  wine  prepared  from  these  by  fermentation.  It 
forms  crystals  containing  J  molecule  of  water.  In  the  dry  state  it 
melts  at  110o-lll°. 

Isomerides  of  Mannitan. 

853.  Crystalline  bodies  isomeric  with  mannitan  are  found  in 
several  plants ;  their  constitution  must,  however,  be  different,  as  no 
union  with  water  and  conversion  into  compounds  of  the  mannite 
formula  has  been  observed. 

Finite,  C6H1205,  occurs  in  the  exudations  of  the  Californian  pine 
Pinus  lambertiana.  It  forms  hard,  warty  crystal  masses  of  in- 
tensely sweet  taste,  which  melt  at  150°  and  whose  solution  rotates 
the  plane  of  polarisation  to  the  right. 

Isodulcite,  C6H1205,H20,is  obtained,  together  with  quercetin,  by 
boiling  quercitrin  with  dilute  mineral  acids.  It  forms  large  trans- 
parent crystals,  which  are  readily  soluble,  and  melt  at  105°-110° 
with  loss  of  their  water  of  crystallisation.

DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  HEPTAVALENT  HYDROCARBON 

NUCLEUS,  CnH2n_5. 

Monobasic  Acids  of  the  Series  CnH2n_402. 

854.  Acids  of  this  series,  CnH2n  _  5O.OH  or  Cn-H2n.  _  3.CO.OH,  are 
mostly  prepared  by  the  action  of  excess  of  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate 
on  the  halogen  addition  products  of  the  members  of  the  acryl  oleic 
acid  series  : 

Cn,H2n._  !Br2CO.OH  +  3KOH  =  2KBr  +  3H20 
+  Cn.H2n._3.CO.OK, 

or,  what  comes  to  essentially  the  same  thing,  on  the  first  halogen 
substitution  products  of  those  acids  : 

Cn'H2n'_2Br.CO.OH  +  2KOH  =  KBr  +  2H20  +  CnH2n._3.CO.OK. 

In  the  carbon  residue  united  to  CO. OH  either  double  union  of 
neighbouring  carbon  atoms  occurs  twice,  or  else  one  triple  union 
occurs,  so  that  the  acids  can  unite  directly  with  four  atoms  of 
halogen. 

By  action  of  nitric  acid  the  higher  members  of  the  series  similarly 
unite  with  two  atoms  of  oxygen,  and  yield  monobasic  acids  of  the 
formula  CnH2n_404,  which  further  yield  first  half-aldehydes  and 
later  acids  of  the  succinic  series,  whose  carbon  contents  is  equal  to  half 
that  of  the  acid  CnH2n  _  404  : 

CnH2n_404  +  30  =  C|H2|_204  +C|H2|_203. 

855.  Tetrolic  acid,  C4H402  or  C3H3CO.OH.     Either 

CH3.C ;  C.CO.OH 

or  CH2  :  C  :  CH.CO.OH  is  formed  by  heading  chlor  a-crotonic  acid 
with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  on  the  water  bath,  and  is  obtained 
from  the  potassic  salt  first  formed  : 

CH3.CC1  :CH.CO.OK  +  KOH  =  KC1  +  H20  +  C3H3.CO.OK, 

by  addition  of  sulphuric  acid,  and  extracted  from  the  aqueous  solution 
by  shaking  with  ether,  and  also  by  the  action  of  carbonic  anhydride 
on  sodium  allylene,  CH3.C  •  CNa.  It  crystallises  in  rhombic  tables, 
deliquescing  in  air,  is  also  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether,  and  melts  at 
76-5°  and  boils  at  203°. 

856.  Sorbie  acid,  C6H802  =  C5H7.CO.OH,  is  obtained  from  the 
juice  of  unripe  berries  of  the  mountain  ash  by  distillation,  and  passes 
over  with  the  vapour  of  water  as  a  yellow  oil.     This  oil,  on  heating 


496      DERIVATIVES   OF  THE   HEPTAVALENT   RADICALS,  CnH,u_5. 

with  solid  potassic  hydrate  and  acidulation,  or  by  long  boiling  with 
strong  hydrochloric  acid,  yields  solid  sorbic  acid.  It  crystallises  in 
long  colourless  needles,  very  difficultly  soluble  in  cold,  more  readily  in 
hot  water  and  in  alcohol,  and  melts  at  134'5°.  Although  not  distill- 
able  unchanged  alone  it  passes  over  in  the  vapour  of  water.  Its 
baric  salt,  (C5H7.CO.O)2Ba,  crystallises  in  silvery  scales,  which  are 
readily  soluble. 

Ethylic  sorbate,  C5H7CO.O.C2tI5,  prepared  by  saturating  the 
alcoholic  solution  of  the  acid  with  hydrochloric  acid,  is  an  oil  of 
aromatic  odour  boiling  at  195 '5°. 

Sorbic  acid  unites  with  nascent  hydrogen,  forming  hydrosorbic acid 
(§  798,  2),  with  bromine,  according  to  the  quantity  of  the  latter, 
either  to  form  the  dibromide,  C5H7Br2.CO.OH,  crystallising  in 
small  brilliant  plates  and  melting  at  94°-95°,  or  the  tetrabromide, 
CftH7Br4.CO.OH,  or  tetrabrom-hexylic  acid,  which  is  difficultly 
soluble  in  water,  melts  at  183°,  and  yields  salts  with  the  alkalies, 
barium,  calcium,  and  zinc,  which  mostly  crystallise  in  brilliant  plates 
and  decompose  on  boiling. 

857.  Palmitolic  acid,  C10H28O2  =  C15H27CO.OH,  is  obtained  by 
heating  hypogacic  acid  and  gaidic  acid  dibromides  (§  799)  with 
alcoholic  potassic  hydrate,  and  decomposition  of  the  aqueous  solutions 
of  the  potassic  salt  formed  by  mineral  acids.  It  crystallises  from 
alcohol  and  ether  in  fine  silky  needles,  insoluble  in  water,  melting  at 
42°,  and  combining  directly  with  bromine  to  form  the  bromides 
C16H28Br202  and  C16H28Br402. 

Fuming  nitric  acid  converts  palmitolic  acid  into  palmitoxylic  acid, 
C15H2702CO.OH,  crystallising  in  plates  and  melting  at  67°,  and 
further  oxidises  the  latter  with  resolution  into  suberic  aldehvdic 
acid,  C8H1403  (§  782),  and  suberic  acid,  C8H1404  (§  841). 

Stearolic  acid,  C18H3202  =  Cl7H3,.CO.OH,  is  obtained  from  the 
dibromides  of  oleic  and  elaidic  acids  in  long  colourless  prisms,  melting 
at  48°,  which  are  little  soluble  in  cold  alcohol.  It  volatilises  without 
decomposition.  Its  salts  are  mostly  crystalline,  those  of  the  alkalies 
haying  the  properties  of  soaps.  It  does  not  unite  with  nascent 
hydrogen,  but  gives  with  bromine  a  liquid  dibromide  : 

C18H31Br2O.OH< 

and  a  crystalline  tetrabromide,  Ci8H31Br4O.OH,  which  melts  at  70°. 
Nitric  acid  converts  stearolic  acid  into  stearoxylic  acid : 

C1&H3204=C17H3102.CO.OH. 

This  crystallises  in  brilliant  plates,  melting  at  86°.  Further  action  of 
the  oxidising  agent  conveits  it,  with  decomposition  of  the  molecule, 
into  azela-aldehydic  acid,  C9H1603,  and  azelaic  acid,  C9H1604. 

Behenolic  acid,  C22H40O2  =  C21H39.CO.OH,  obtained  by  action  of 
alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  on  erucic  acid  dibromide  at  150°  and  on 
brassic  acid  dibromide  at  210°-220°.  It  crystallises  from  alcohol  in 
tufts  of  needles,  melting  at  57'5°,  and  gives  crystalline  bromides  with 
two  and  four  atoms  of  bromine.  Concentrated  nitric  acid  converts 
it  into  belienoxylic  acid,  C.21H3902.CO.OH,  brilliant  plates  melting 
at  90°-91°,  brassylo-aldehydic  acid,  CnH20O3,  and  brassylic  acid 
CnH20O2. 


TARTRONIC  ACID.  497 


Derivatives  of  the  Radicals  of  Dibasic  Hydroxy- Acids. 

858.  The  compounds  of  this  series  are  mostly  dibasic  acids,  which 
are  derived  from  the  acids  of  the  series  CryH2ll.(CO.OH)2  by  substitu- 
tion of  halogen,  hydroxyl,  &c,  for  a  hydrogen  atom.  The  hydroxyl 
derivatives,  Cn.H2n._  ,(OH)(CO.OH)2,  therefore,  bear  the  same  relation 
to  these  dibasic  acids  as  that  of  the- gly collie  to  the  fatty  acids. 

Tartronic  Acid,  C3H405  =  CH(OH)(CO.OH)2. 

859.  Tartronic  or  hydroxy-malonic  acid  was  first  obtained  by 
evaporating  an  aqueous  solution  of  dinitro-tartaric  acid  : 

CH(O.N02).CO.OH  CO.OH 

|  =  C02  +  N,03  +    | 

CH(O.N02).CO.OH  CH(OH).CO.OH 

it  is  also  formed  by  the  action  of  nascent  hydrogen  on  mesoxalic  acid  : 

co!co1oh  + 2H  =  ch(oh);co!oh 

and  by  the  oxidation  of  grape  sugar  by  an  alkaline  copper  solution. 
It  crystallises  in  large  colourless  prisms,  melting  at  180°,  with  evolu- 
tion of  water  and  carbonic  anhydride,  and  leaving  an  amorphous 
residue  of  glycollide  (§  713)  : 


CH(OH).CO.OH  CH2V 

=  C02  +  H20+   |       >0 
CO.OH  CO  / 


860.  Chloral  cyanhydrin  is  a  derivative  of  the  same  carbon 
nucleus ;  it  is  obtained  by  the  action  of  hydrocyanic  acid  on  chloral 
hydrate  : 

CC13.CH(0H)2  +  HCN  =  H20  +  CCl3.CH(OH).CN. 

It  crystallises  in  colourless  prisms,  melting  between  60°  and  61°,  and 
is  decomposed  by  alkalies  into  chloroform  and  metallic  formate  and 
cyanide. 

Trichlor-lactic  acid,  CCl3.CH(OH).CO.OH,  obtained  by  the  action 
of  aqueous  acids  on  chloral  cyanhydrin,  is  another  derivative  of  the 
same  carbon  nucleus;  it  is  crystalline  and  melts  between  105°  and 
110°.     Its  salts  readily  decompose  into  formates  and  chloral : 

CCl3.CH(OH).CO.ONa  =  CCl3.CHO  +  CHO.ONa. 

Ethylic  trichlor-lactate  forms  plates  melting  between  66°  and  67°. 

Malic  Acid,  C4H605  =  C2H3(OH)(CO.OH)2. 

861.  Three  isomeric  acids  are  possible  of  this  formula  : 

CH2. CO.OH  p^   ATT  ^/-w   ATT 

,  CH3.C(OH) ^  ^  ,  and  CH2(OH)OH'^^ 
CH(OH).CO.OH  .OU.UH  .CO.OH 

So  far  only  two  are  known,  which,  however,  appear  not  to  be  struc- 
tural but  physical  isomers.     One  of  them,  natural  malic  acid,  rotates 

K  K 


498      DERIVATIVES   OF   THE  HEPTAVALENT  RADICALS,  CnH.2n_5. 

the  plane  of  polarisation  to  the  right,  whilst  the  artificial  is  optically 
inactive.  Both  of  them  are  converted  into  ordinary  succinic  acid  by 
heating  with  hydriodic  acid,  and  lnir^t,  therefore,  correspond  to  the 
first  of  the  three  formulae  above  given. 

Natural  or  optically  active  malic  acid  occurs  very  widely  disse- 
minated in  the  vegetable  juices,  in  the  free  state  in  sour  apples,  unripe 
grapes,  and  especially  in  quinces  and  unripe  mountain  ash  berries. 

It  is  best  prepared  from  the  boiled  and  filtered  juice  of  the  latter, 
which  is  then  nearly  saturated  with  milk  of  lime,  so  that  it  only 
possesses  a  feebly  acid  reaction.     On  continued  boiling  calcic  malate, 

C2H3(OH)*pQ'/-y]>Ca,H20,  precipitates  as  a  nearly  insoluble  crystal- 
line powder.  This  is  then  added  as  long  as  it  still  dissolves  to  nitric 
acid  diluted  with  ten  times  its  weight  of  water.  On  cooling  large 
brilliant,  transparent  crystals,  difficultly  soluble  in  water,  of  hydric 

C2H3(OH)"pq'q J2Ca,8H20,  separate  ;  these  are  dis- 
solved in  hot  water  and  precipitated  with  plumbic  acetate.  The 
washed,  insoluble  plumbic  salt,  C2H3(OH)(CO.O)2Pb,  is  then  sus- 
pended in  water,  decomposed  by  hydric  sulphide,  and  the  filtered  liquid 
evaporated. 

Malic  acid  crystallises  only  difficultly  in  cauliflower- like  aggregates, 
which  deliquesce  in  acid.  It  melts  at  below  100°  and  decomposes  at 
150°,  or  on  long  boiling  with  hydrochloric  acid,  into  water  and 
fumaric  acid  : 

C2H3(OH)(CO.OH)2  =  H20  +  C2H.2(CO.OH)2. 

Phosphoric  chloride  converts  it  into  fumaric  dichloride,  C2H2(C0.C1)2. 
Its  aqueous  solution  rotates  the  plane  of  a  polarised  beam  of  light 
somewhat  to  the  left   (specif,  rotation  =  —  5°).     By   heating   with 
hydrobromic  acid  it  is  converted  into  brom-succinic  acid  : 

C2H3(OH)(CO.OH)2  +  HBr  =  HX>  +  C2H3Br(CO.OH)2 ; 

with  strong  hydriodic  acid  it  yields  ordinary  succinic  acid  : 

C2H3(OH)(CO.OH)2  +  2HI  =  H20  +  I2  +  C2H4  :(CO.OH)2. 

Chromic  acid  converts  malic  acid  into  malonic  acid  (§  830) ;  putrefac- 
tion   ferments    convert  it    into   carbonic  anhydride,  acetic    succinic 
(§  833)  and  butyric  acids.     Fusing  with  potassic  hydrate  decomp 
it  into  acetate  and  oxalate  : 

CH(OH)CO.OK 

|  +  KOH  =  CH3.CO.OK  +  KO.CO.CO.OK  +  H,. 

CH2.CO.OK 

The  alkaline  malates  are  readily  soluble,  all  others  difficultly 
soluble;  all  are  crystalline. 

Di'thylic  malate,  C2H3(OH)  :(CO.O.C2H5)2,  is  obtained  by  satur- 
ating an  alcoholic  solution  of  malic  acid  with  hydrochloric  acid.  The 
liquid,  after  standing  for  a  long  time,  is  neutralised  with  sodie  hydrate 
and  shaken  with  ether.  On  evaporation  of  the  solution  diethylic 
malate  is  obtained  as  a  liquid  soluble  in  alcohol,  ether,  and  also  in 
water,  the  latter  soon  decomposing  it  into  alcohol  and  malic  acid. 


ASPARAGINE.  499 

On  mixing  it  with  ace  ty  lie  chloride  a  violent  reaction  occurs,  in 
which  there  is  formed  : 

CoH3(OH)(CO.O.C9H5)  +  C1.C2H30  =  HC1 
+  C2H3(O.C2H30)(CO.O.C2H5)2, 

Diethylic  acetyl  malate,  a  liquid  boiling  at  258°,  insoluble  in  water, 
saponified  by  alkalies  into  ethylic  alcohol  and  a  malate  and  an  acetate. 

Alcoholic   ammonia    converts   diethylic    malate   into    maim 
C2H3(OH):(( .'<  ».  X  1 1  _. )  _,,   which  separates  in  anhydrous   crystalfl   on 
evaporation. 

Asparagine  and  aspartic  acid  are  most  important  derivatives  of 
malic  acid. 

862.  Asparagine,  C4H8N203,  occurs  in  the  juices  of  many  plants, 
dally  in  such  parts  as  have  been  formed  in  the  dark.     It  occur- 
largely  in  asparagus  shoots,  in  the  roots  of  Althaea  and  Scorzon 
also  in  the  shoots  evolved  in  the  dark  by  leguminosa?. 

To  prepare  it  young  shoots  of  vetch,  grown  in  the  dark,  are 
Btrongly  pressed,  the  filtered  juice  boiled  to  remove  albuminoids,  and 
the  filtered  liquid  evaporated  to  a  syrup.  On  long  standing  aspara- 
gine separates,  and  is  purified  by  repeated  crystallisation  from  hot 
water,  being  at  first  also  heated  with  animal  charcoal. 

It  forms  hard,  colourless,  four-sided,  rhombic  prisms  of  the  formula 
C4H8N203,H20.  It  is  difficultly  soluble  in  cold  water,  scarcely  in 
alcohol ;  it  decomposes  at  higher  temperatures  without  volatilisation. 
It  rotates  the  plane  of  polarisation  to  the  left. 

Asparagine  is  isomeric  with  nialamide;  it  behaves  as  though 
an  amide  of  the  alcohol  group  of  malic  acid,  and  also  as  an  amic  acid  j 
its  structural  formula  is  therefore  :

Aspartic  acid  occurs  in  sugar  molasses,  and  in  the  product  of 
decomposition  of  albuminoids,  by  boiling  with  sulphuric  acid  or  by 
heating  with  bromine  and  water  or  zincic  chloride.  It  crystallises  in 
colourless  rhombic  prisms,  which  are  scarcely  soluble  in  alcohol  and 
require  364  parts  of  water  at  11°  for  solution.  It  rotates  the  plane 
of  polarisation  to  the  right. 

Aspartic  acid  stands  to  malic  acid  in  the  same  relation  as  glycocine 
t  1  glycollic  acid,  and  in  consequence  yields  salts  with  both  acids  and 
alkalies.

On  heating  succinic  acid  with  a  molecule  of  bromine  and  1 5  times

Paraconic  acid  may  be  regarded  as  the  ethereal  anhydride  of 
itamalic  acid.  It  is  obtained  together  with  that  body  by  heating

It  is  crystalline,  melts  at  70°,  and  is  readily  soluble  in  water.  It 
unites  with  hydrobroinic  acid,  forming  itabrom-pyrotartaric  acid,  and 
is  converted  into  itamalic  acid  by  strong  bases. 

b.  Citramalic  Acid.- — Citraconic  acid  unites  with  hydrochloric 
acid,  forming  citrachlor-pyrotartaric  acid,  03H5Cl(CO.OH)2,  which 
readily  decomposes — mere  warming  of  its  aqueous  solution  sufficing — 
into  hydrochloric  and  mesaconic  acids,  and  from  which  citramalic 
acid  cannot  be  prepared  ;  but  this  can  be  obtained  from  the  addition 
product  of  hypochlorous  and  citraconic  acids,  eld  or -citramalic  acid  : 

C3H4:(CO.OH)2  +  C10H  =  C3H4Cl(OH):(CO.OH)2, 
when  its  aqueous  solution  is  heated  with  zinc  : 

2C3H4Cl(OH):(CO.OH)2  +  Zn3  =  ZnCl2 
+  2C3H5(OH):(CO.O)2Zn  +  H2. 

Citrainalic  acid  is  dibasic,  amorphous,  and  deliquescent. 

c.  Mesamalic  Acid. — Mesaconic  acid  gives  with  hydrochloric 
acid  the  crystal  line  mesachlor  pyrotartaric  acid,  which  melts-  at 
129°-130°,  and  on  boiling  with  water  decomposes  into  mesamalic 
and  hydrochloric  acids.  Mesamalic  acid*  is  deliquescent  and  melts 
at  60°. 

All  three  acids  are  hydroxyl  derivatives  of  pyrotartaric  acid,  into 
which  they  can  be  converted  by  heating  with  hydriodic  acid. 

2.  Glyceryl  hydrate  dicarbonic  acid,  erroneously  termed  oxypvro- 
tartaric  acid,  is  prepared  from  dichlorhydrin.  By  heating  this  latter 
with  alcohol  and  potassic  cyanide,  dieyanhydrin  is  formed,  which  on 
boiling  with  potassic  hydrate  yields  ammonia  and  potassic  glyceryl 
hydrate  dicarbonate  :

which  forms  rhombic  pyramids,  difficultly  soluble  in  water,  and  which 
on  treatment  with  nitrous  acid  yields  hydroxy-glutaric  acid. 

This  latter  has  only  been  obtained  in  the  form  of  a  scarcely  erys- 
tallisable  syrup,  and  forms  amorphous  salts.  Hydriodic  acid  converts 
it  into  glutaric  acid  (§  838,  3).  The  constitution  of  this  compound 
is  entirely  unknown. 

4.  Methyl  hydroxy-succinic  acid :

TEKEBIC  ACID.  503 

hydrocyanic  acid  at  100°,  and  then  digesting  with  hydrochloric  acid. 
It  crystallises  in  deliquescent  needles. 

867.  Probably  <liaterebicaci<l,  C7H120-,  and  U  .  C7H10O4, 
belong  to  this  group.  The  first  is  only  known  in  the  form  of  salts, 
the  latter  in  the  free  state  also. 

To  prepare  terebic  acid,  oil  of  turpentine  is  warmed  to  80°  with  four 
parts  of  nitric  acid  of  sp.  gr.  125.  As  soon  as  the  first  violent  action 
has  ceased  the  resulting  mass  Is  heated  on  the  water  bath  for 
twenty-four  hours,  with  frequent  addition  of  small  quantities  of  nitric 
acid  of  sp.  gr.  1*4.  The  liquid,  evaporated  to  a  third  of  its  volume, 
is  then  mixed  with  much  water,  filtered  if  necessary,  and  evaporated 
to  crystallisation.  Hydric  amnionic  oxalate  crystallises  out  with  the 
terebic  acid,  from  which  the  latter  can  be  separated  by  recrystallisation 
from  hot  water. 

Terebic  acid  forms  small,  brilliant,  colourless  prisms,  which  dis- 
solve in  about  100  parts  of  cold  water,  more  readily  in  alcohol  and 
boiling  water.  It  melts  at  175°,  sublimes  below  that  temperature, 
decomposes  on  greater  heating  into  carbonic  anhvdride  and  pvroterebic 
acid  (§  798,  3). 

With  carbonates  it  yields  monobasic  terebates,  <  '71 1  .MO.,,  which 
are  mostly  soluble  in  water.  Strong  bases,  on  the  other  hand,  give  the 
dibasic,  mostly  difficultly  soluble  and  more  crvstallisable,  salt  of  dia- 
terebic  acid : 

C7H9K04  +  KOH  =  c:H.   K,05, 

which  on  treatment  with  carbonic  anhydride  lose  half  their  metal 
and  are  reconverted  into  tereb. 

These  reactions  and  the  decomposition  suffered  by  terebic  acid 
on  heating  render  the  following  constitutional  formula?  probable  :

Their  relations  to  one  another  are  the  same  as  those  of  itamalic  and

The  Group  of  '  Carbo-Hydrates.' 

868.  The  compounds  belonging  to  this  family  contain  either  six 
or  some  whole  multiple  of  six  carbon  atoms,  and  twice  as  many  hy- 
drogen as  oxygen  atoms.  They  are  amongst  the  most  important 
physiological  compounds,  generally  forming  the  principal  part  of  the 
organic  matter  of  the  vegetable  organism,  and  also  occur  largely  in  the 
animal  body. 

The  very  numerous  members  correspond  almost  without  exception 
to  one  of  the  formulae  C6Hl206,  CjjH^Oh,  and  C6H10O5,  and  stand 
to  one  another  in  very  simple  genetic  relations. 

The  compounds  corresponding  to  lx)th  the  last  expressions  must  be

expressed  as  anhydrides  of  those  of  the  first,  and  as  a  matter  of  fact 
are  converted  into  them  by  action  of  ferments  or  by  boiling  with 
acids,  water  being  combined  : 

C^H^On  +  H,0  =-  2C6H1206 
and 

(C6H10O5)n  +  nR20  =  rcC6H1206. 

Although  so  far  not  a  single  one  of  these  bodies  has  been  prepared 
synthetically,  nor  the  molecular  weight  yet  been  determined  with 
certainty  in  a  single  case,  yet  something  is  known  of  the  constitution 
of  these  bodies.  They  have,  without  exception,  the  properties  of  poly- 
hydric  alcohols,  and  some  of  them  in  addition  behave  like  aldehydes. 
The  compounds  C6H1206  and  C12H22011  are  soluble  in  water,  have  a 
sweet  taste,  and  are  termed  sugars,  whilst  a  part  of  those  having  the 
atomic  proportion  C6H10O5  cannot  be  dissolved  unchanged  by  any 
liquid. 

The  Sugars,  C6H1206.     Glucoses. 

869.  The  most  widely  disseminated  and  most  important  sugars  of 
this  group  are  the  first  aldehydes  of  the  mannite  bodies,  C6H1406 
(§  846  and  following),  and  can  be  converted  into  those  bexhydric 
alcohols  by  the  action  of  nascent  hydrogen.  As  aldehydes  they  reduce 
the  oxides  of  the  noble  metals,  as  also  cupric  oxide  when  free  alkali  is 
present.  In  addition  they  behave  as  pentahydiic  alcohols,  i.e.  can 
exchange  five  hydrogen  atoms  for  acid  radicals,  forming  true  salts, 
also  can  exchange  some  of  these  hydrogen  atoms  for  metal,  which, 
however,  is  again  removed  by  carbonic  anhydride.  Several  of  them 
are  so  decomposed  by  yeast,  when  in  aqueous  solution,  that  the  main 
products  are  ethylic  alcohol  and  carbonic  anhydride.  Their  constitu- 
tion can  be  expressed  by  the  formula  C5H6(OH)5.CH  :  O.  That 
the  group  C5H5(OH)5,  even  if  each  hydroxyl  group  be  united 
to  a  different  carbon  atom,  can  have  varied  constitutions,  and 
therefore  is  the  cause  of  true  isomerism,  requires  no  further 
proof.  The  number  of  possible  isomers  would  be  still  further 
increased  if,  as  with  the  single  aldehydes  of  the  formula  CnH2nO, 
polymerisations  also  occurred,  and  physical  isomerism  may  also  occur. 

There  still  remains  the  further  possibility  of  the  existence  of 
hexhydric  alcohols  of  the  formula  C6H120G  =  C6H6(OH)6,  in  whose 
carbon  nuclei  there  must  occur  either  one  divalent  union  of  neigh- 
bouring carbon  atoms  or  the  nucleus  must  be  closed  to  a  ring.  Such 
bodies  are,  so  far,  not  known  with  certainty,  but  it  is  quite  possible 
that  certain  sugars  which  lack  the  properties  of  aldehydes,  and  also 
are  incapable  of  fermentation,  may  belong  to  the  category.

Grape  Sugar,  Glucose  or  Dextrose,  \

870.  Dextrose  occurs  in  most  sweet-tasting  fruits,  such  as  grapes, 
figs,  cherries,  plums,  <fce.,  often  together  with  the  isomeric  fruit  sugar. 
It  can  be  obtained  from  these  fruits  by  boiling  and  filtering  the  juice, 
evaporating  to  a  syrup,  when,  on  standing,  it  crystallises  after  a  time 
in  warty  masses,  and  can  be    purified    by  crystallisation  from  hot

alcohol.  Dextrose  occurs,  together  with  lcevulose,  in  honey,  in  small 
quantity  in  healthy  blood  and  urine,  and  at  times  largely  pathologically 
in  the  latter  (especially  in  cases  of  diabetes).  It  also  is  found  in 
small  quantity  in  the  liver  when  examined  quickly  after  death ;  after 
the  lapse  of  a  little  time  it  is  found  in  large  quantity,  as  the  result 
of  post  mortem  changes  in  the  glycogen  contained  in  the  liver.  It  is 
further  obtained  by  the  action  of  certain  ferments  or  hot  dilute  acids 
on  certain  of  the  carbo-hydrates  of  the  formulae  C12H22On  (e.g.  from 
cane  sugar  together  with  Isevulose)  and  C6H10O5  (cellulose,  starch, 
dextrin),  by  combination  of  water,  and  by  similar  action  from  numer- 
ous organic  bodies  which  are  ethereal  or  saline  compounds  of  dextrose 
and  are  termed  glucosides  (e.g.  salicine,  phloridzine,  amygdaline,  &c.) 
On  the  large  scale  it  is  generally  prepared  by  adding  10  parts  of 
starch  in  portions  to  a  boiling  mixture  of  1  part  of  sulphuric  acid 
and  20  parts  of  water ;  after  boiling  for  several  hours  the  acid  is  neu- 
tralised with  calcic  carbonate,  the  solution  freed  from  the  separated 
calcic  sulphate,  decolourised  by  animal  charcoal,  and  the  syrup  evapo- 
rated. This,  on  ccoling,  then  solidifies  to  an  indistinctly  crystalline 
mass  of  grape  sugar.  Starch  can  also  be  converted  into  dextrose  by 
the  action  of  the  diastase  of  malt.  To  obtain  it  pure  it  must  be 
finally  crystallised  from  alcohol. 

From  aqueous  solution  dextrose  separates  in  colourless  granular 
masses  of  the  formula  C6H1206,H20;  from  strong  alcohol,  anhydrous 
in  fine  needles,  which  unite  to  wart-like  masses. 

They  first  lose  their  water  of  crystallisation  on  slow  heating  below 
80°  ;  on  quick  heating  to  this  temperature  they  melt,  and  an  amorphous 
hygroscopic  mass  is  obtained,  which  is  slowly  reconverted  into  crystals 
on  exposure  to  moist  air. 

Dry  dextrose  dissolves  in  1^  part  of  cold  water,  50  parts  of  85  % 
alcohol  at  ordinary  temperatures,  but  only  about  5  parts  at  the  boiling 
point. 

All  solutions  of  dextrose  rotate  the  plane  of  polarisation  strongly 
to  the  right ;  the  specific  rotatory  power  of  freshly  prepared  solutions 
of  both  crystalline  forms  and  of  that  dried  without  fusion  =  104°.  On 
keeping  this  diminishes  slowly  by  boiling  quickly  until  it  becomes 
constant  at  [a]  =  56°.  This  latter  rotary  power  is  also  that  of  a 
freshly  prepared  solution  of  amorphous  grape  sugar  rendered  anhydrous 
by  fusion,  and  of  such  as  occurs  in  aqueous  solution  (therefore  of  that 
in  urine). 

By  long  heating  to  170°  dry  dextrose  loses  a  molecule  of  water 
and  is  transformed  into  ylucosane,  C6H10O5,  an  amorphous  mass  of 
scarcely  sweet  taste,  which  stands  to  dextrose  as  mannitan  does  to 
mannite,  and  similarly  can  be  reconverted  into  dextrose  by  slow  ad- 
dition of  water,  especially  by  boiling  with  dilute  mineral  acids. 

The  noble  metals  are  precipitated  in  the  metallic  state  from  all 
their  solutions  by  dextrose,  mercury  even  being  precipitated  from 
mercuric  cyanide.  Cupric  solutions  are  also  reduced  in  the  presence 
of  free  alkali.  This  latter  reaction  occurs  slowly  in  the  cold,  very 
quickly  on  heating,  and  in  the  latter  case  gives  pure  anhydrous 
cuprous  oxide.  In  the  presence  of  free  alkali  basic  bismuthous  nitrate 
is  also  reduced. 

The  reduction  of  cupric  salts  is  employed  in  a  very  useful  volume-

trie  method  for  the  estimation  of  dextrose,  one  molecule  of  the  latter 
in  presence  of  much  water  causing  the  reduction  of  five  molecules  of 
cupric  salt  to  cuprous  oxide. 

The  copper  is  employed  in  the  form  of  '  Fehling's  solution.'  This 
is  prepared  by  dissolving  34'64  grams  of  pure  crystallised  cupric  sul- 
phate in  about  100  grams  of  water,  mixed  with  a  solution  of  200  grams 
of  pobassic  sodic  tartrate  in  600  cc.  of  sodic  hydrate  solution  of  1-13 
sp.  gr.,  and  the  whole  made  up  to  1,000  cc.  by  addition  of  water. 
10  cc.  of  this  solution  will  require  for  complete  reduction  '05  gram  of 
dextrose.  After  the  reaction  the  salts  of  tartronic  and  several  other 
organic  acids  are  found  in  solutiou. 

In  presence  of  free  alkalies  dextrose  can  be  oxidised  by  exposure 
to  air ;  in  absence  of  air  an  alkaline  solution,  on  heating,  turns  brown, 
and  after  a  time  deposits  humus-like  bodies. 

The  decompositions  of  grape  sugar  in  aqueous  solution  by  yeast, 
chiefly  into  alcohol  and  carbonic  anhydride,  and  by  putrefaction  ferments 
into  lactic  and  later  into  butyric  acids,  with  simultaneous  formation  of 
mannite,  have  been  already  mentioned  at  the  respective  places.  Under 
other  circumstances,  at  present  not  known  with  certainty,  the  so-called 
mucous  fermentation  occurs,  whose  chief  products  are  a  gummy  body, 
lactic  acid  and  mannite. 

Mannite  is  also  formed  from  dextrose  by  nascent  hydrogen  evolved 
with  sodium  amalgam.  From  this  it  is  very  probable,  though  not 
certain,  that  dextrose  may  be  expressed  by  the  formula  : 

CH2(OH).CH(OH).CH(OH).CH(OH).CH(OH).CH:0. 

The  first  oxidation  products  of  dextrose  are  gluconic  and  saccharic 
acids. 

871.  Dextrose  Salts. — Anhydrous  dextrose  dissolves  slowly  and 
without  coloration  in  1J  time  its  weight  of  concentrated  sulphuric 
acid,  and  yields  thereby  a  basic  hydric  sulphate  corresponding  in 
general  to  glycerine  sulphuric  acid.  The  formula  of  this  dextrose 
sulphuric  acid  is  not  known,  as,  on  account  of  its  ready  decomposability 
by  water  into  dextrose  and  sulphuric  acid,  it  can  scarcely  be  prepared 
in  a  state  of  purity.     Its  baric  salt  is  soluble. 

Different  acetates  are  obtained  by  heating  dextrose  with  acetic 
anhydride.  One  part  of  dextrose  with  2-J-  parts  of  acetic 
anhydride  yields  at  the  boiling  point  of  the  latter  dextrose 
diacetate,  C5H6(OH)3(O.C2H30)2.CHO,  as  a  colourless  amorphous 
mass,  melting  below  100°,  of  very  bitter  taste,  readily  soluble  in 
alcohol  and  water,  which  by  heating  to  160°  with  water  is  rapidly  de- 
composed into  acetic  acid  and  dextrose.  If  it  is  heated  for  a  long  time 
to  140°  with  double  its  weight  of  acetic  anhydride  dextrose  triacetate, 
C5H6(OH)2(O.C2H30)3.CHO,  is  formed  as  a  colourless  solid  mass, 
difficultly  soluble  in  water,  readily  in  alcohol  and  ether. 

On  heating  dextrose  with  large  excess  of  acetylic  chloride  a  pretty 
energetic  reaction  occurs,  and  after  evaporation  there  remains  aceto- 
chlor-hydrose,  i.e.  dextrose  chloride  tetracetate  : 

C5H6Cl(O.C2H30)4.CHO, 

as  a  colourless  crystalline  body,  very  readily  decomposed  by  water 
and  converted  by  well-cooled  strong  nitric  acid  into  dextrose  nitrate 


SUGARS,   C6H1206.  507 

tetracetate,  C^H6(O.N02)(O.C2H30).,.CHO,  which  crystallises  in  rhom- 
bic tables  and  prisms  melting  at  145°,  is  insoluble  in  water,  but 
soluble  in  alcohol. 

872.  Metallic  Compounds  of  Dextrose. — Like  all  polyhydric 
alcohols  dextrose  combines  with  metals  when  in  contact  with  basic 
hydrates.  The  resulting  compounds  are  mostly  soluble  in  water,  are 
decomposed  by  carbonic  anhydride  into  dextrose  and  a  carbonate,  and 
are  oxidised  and  turn  brown  on  exposure  to  atmospheric  oxygen. 

On  mixing  alcoholic  solutions  of  dextrose  and  potassic  hydrate,  a 
transparent  jelly  of  potassium  dextrose  separates,  which  soon  discolours 
and  decomposes.  The  barium  and  calcium  compounds  are  also  soluble 
in  water.  An  insoluble  lead  compound  is  obtained  by  precipitating  a 
solution  of  dextrose  by  basic  plumbic  acetate,  as  an  amorphous  preci- 
pitate containing  three  atoms  of  lead  to  two  molecules  of  sugar. 

In  presence  of  alkali  cupric  oxide  is  largely  dissolved  to  a  deep 
blue  liquid,  which  soon  deposits  cuprous  oxide. 

A  beautiful  crystalline  compound,  dextrose  sodic  chloride  : 

2C6H1206,NaCl,H20, 

is  formed  by  mixing  solutions  of  dextrose  and  common  salt  and 
evaporating  slowly.  This  often  separates  spontaneously  from  diabetic 
urine. 

Lcevulose,  or  Fruit  Sugar,  C6H120G. 

873.  Lsevulose  frequently  accompanies  dextrose  in  the  juices  of 
sweet  fruits,  and  together  with  the  latter  constitutes  honey.  It  is 
formed  together  with  dextrose  in  the  decomposition  of  cane  sugar  by 
ferments  or  by  boiling  with  acids,  and  is  formed  alone  in  the  corre- 
sponding transformation  of  inulin.  As  lsevulose  does  not  crystallise, 
its  purification  is  extremely  difficult.  The  separation  from  dextrose 
is  best  effected  by  means  of  the  difficultly  soluble  lime  compound. 

Dried  at  100°,  lsevulose  forms  a  gummy,  deliquescent  mass,  which 
is  pretty  soluble  in  mediumly  concentrated  spirit,  but  is  insoluble  in 
absolute  alcohol.  The  solutions  rotate  the  plane  of  polarisation  to  the 
left,  the  specific  rotary  power  =  —  104°. 

Towards  ferments,  bases,  oxides  of  the  noble  metals,  and  alkaline 
cupric  solutions  it  behaves  exactly  like  dextrose.  Heated  to  170°,  it 
is  converted  into  laivulosane,  C6H10O5,  which  can  be  reconverted 
into  hevulose.     On  oxidation  it  yields  saccharic  acid. 

Mannitose,  obtained  from  mannite  by  moderated  oxidation,  bears  a 
great  resemblance  to  laevulose,  but  it  is  distinguished  by  its  optical 
inactivity. 

Lactose,  C6H1206. 

874.  Lactose  is  formed  from  milk  sugar  by  treatment  with  ferments 
or  dilute  acids,  together  with  another  sugar  which  appears  to  be 
dextrose.  On  evaporating  the  liquid  lactose  crystallises  first  in  leafy 
and  warty  crystals.  It  has  a  greater  dextrorotary  power  than 
dextrose,  undergoes  alcoholic  fermentation  when  mixed  with  yeast, 
and  reduces  alkaline  cupric  salts  to  cuprous  oxide.  It  is  distinguished 
from  dextrose  by  giving  no  compound  with  sodic  chloride,  and  by 
yielding  lactonic  and  mucic  acids  as  its  first  products  of  oxidation,  in 


508      DERIVATIVES   OF  THE  HEPTAVALENT   RADICALS,  CnH2n_5. 

this  resembling  dulcite,  which  latter  can  be  obtained  from  it  by  ad- 
dition of  hydrogen.     Lactose  is  therefore  the  first  aldehyde  of  dulcite. 

Non-fermentable  Sugars  of  the  Formula  C6H1206. 

875.  Inosite,  C6H1206,2H20,  is  contained  in  small  quantity  in  the 
juices  of  animal  muscle  (especially  those  of  the  heart)  and  numerous 
organs,  and  also  occurs  in  the  urine  during  some  diseases  of  the 
kidney. 

To  obtain  it  the  mother  liquor  of  the  creatine  crystals  (§  727)  is 
acidulated  with  sulphuric  acid  and  then  gradually  mixed  with  alcohol. 
Potassic  sulphate  first  separates,  and  later  inosite  in  cauliflower-like 
groups  of  colourless  crystals,  which  on  recrystallisation  separate  in 
large  rhombic  prisms  of  sweet  taste.  It  effloresces  in  air,  losing  its 
water  of  crystallisation,  and  then  melts  at  210°.  It  dissolves  in  16 
parts  of  water  at  10*5°,  is  insoluble  in  absolute  alcohol  and  ether. 

On  dissolving  inosite  in  strong  nitric  acid  and  then  adding  con- 
centrated sulphuric  acid,  nitroi'nosite  separates.  This  appears  to  have 
the  composition  CGH6(O.N02)6.  Therefore  inosite  is  not  an  alde- 
hyde sugar,  but  a  hexhydric  alcohol  of  the  formula  C6H6(OH)6. 

A  very  characteristic  rose  coloration  is  obtained  by  evaporating 
inosite  nearly  to  dryness  with  nitric  acid,  adding  some  solution  of 
ammoniacal  calcic  chloride  and  once  more  evaporating. 

Mercuric  nitrate  gives  a  yellow  precipitate  with  solutions  of 
inosite,  which,  on  heating,  turns  red  and  serves  as  a  means  of  detect- 
ing inosite. 

Inosite  is  also  found  in  many  plants,  especially  in  green  beans,  the 
shells  of  peas,  in  the  unripe  berries  and  leaves  of  the  vine,  in  as- 
paragus, &c. 

Sorbin,  C6H1206,  occurs  in  mountain  ash  berries,  and  forms  large 
colourless  crystals,  readily  soluble ;  on  oxidation  it  first  yields  aposorbic 
acid. 

Arabinose,  or  gum  sugar,  C6H1206,  is  formed,  together  with  a  fer- 
mentable syrupy  sugar,  by  the  decomposition  of  arabin  by  dilute  boiling 
sulphuric  acid.  It  crystallises  in  large  transparent  rhombic  prisms, 
readily  dissolving  in  water  and  melting  at  160°.  The  solution  is 
strongly  dextrorotary  (a  =  -+-  116°),  has  an  intensely  sweet  taste,  and 
reduces  alkaline  cupric  solutions  to  cuprous  oxide  and  silver  solutions 
to  metal. 

Eucaline,  C6H1206  (after  drying  at  100°),  is  formed,  together  with 
dextrose,  by  the  decomposition  of  melitose  (see  §  881).  It  is  an  amor- 
phous, dextrorotary  mass,  which  is  readily  decomposed  on  heating,  re- 
duces alkaline  cupric  solutions,  and  is  oxidised  to  oxalic  acid  by  nitric 
acid. 

876.  Sugars  from  Caoutchouc. — Commercial  caoutchouc  contains 
several  peculiar  methyl-ether  saccharine  bodies.  They  are  obtained 
by  heating  the  finely  divided  caoutchouc  with  alcohol,  and  are  left  in 
the  crystalline  form  on  evaporation  of  the  solvent.  By  heating  with 
hydro-haloids  they  yield  methyl  haloid  and  non-fermentable  sugars  of 
the  formula  C6H1206. 

Two  may  be  mentioned  as  representative. 

Dambonite,  C8H1606  =  C6H10(CH3)2O6,  is  obtained  in  the  above- 
mentioned  way  from   the  caoutchouc  of  Gaboon.     It  crystallises  in 


CANE  SUGAR.  509 

prisms,  which  melt  at  190°  and  sublime  slowly  at  210°.  On  heating 
with  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid  to  110°,  methylic  chloride  and 
dambose,  C6H1206,  are  obtained.  The  latter  crystallises  in  thick 
six-sided  prisms,  melting  at  212°  ;  it  is  pretty  soluble  in  water,  but 
insoluble  in  alcohol. 

Borneo  caoutchouc  yields  bornesite,  C7H1406  =  G6Hn(CH3)06, 
crystallising  in  rhombic  prisms,  melting  at  175°,  and  decomposed  by 
hydriodic  acid  into  methylic  iodide  and  Borneo  dambose,  C6H1206, 
which  melts  at  220°. 

Sugars,  C^H^On.     Saccharoses. 

877.  All  these  sugars,  on  boiling  with  dilute  acid  or  by  action  of 
ferments  on  aqueous  solutions,  take  up  water,  and  are  converted  into 
two  molecules  of  the  formula  C6H1206.  They  must  therefore  be  an- 
hydrides of  the  latter  (corresponding  to  the  dialkyl  oxides),  and  have 
the  general  formula  : 

(HO)4C5H6-0-C5H6(OH)4 

CH:0  CH:0 

when  derived  from  the  aldehyde  sugars. 

Numerous  cases  of  isomerism  are  possible  both  where  two  different 
aldehyde  sugars  are  united  or  where  two  molecules  of  the  same 
combine. 

The  decomposition  by  boiling  with  dilute  acids — termed  inversion 
— leads  in  every  case  to  the  formation  of  a  saline  compound  as  an 
intermediate  product. 

[C6H70(OH)4];o  +  H2S04  =  C6H70(OH)4(O.S02.OH) 
+  C6H70(OH)5, 

from  which,  by  boiling  with  water,  regeneration  of  the  acid  is 
effected  : 

C6H70(OH)4(O.S02.OH)  +  H20  =  C6H70(OH)5  +  HO.S02.OH, 

the  latter  then  repeating  the  process  with  fresh  molecules  of  the 
anhydride  sugar. 

The  sugars  C12H22Ou  are  not  directly  fermentable,  but  when 
treated  with  yeast  are  mostly  inverted,  and  then  converted  into 
alcohol  and  carbonic  anhydride. 

Cane  Sugar,  or  Saccharose,  C^H^On- 

878.  Cane  sugar  occurs  in  small  quantity  in  nearly  all  sweet 
fruits,  richly  in  the  sugar  cane  and  in  sorghum,  many  roots,  the 
sugar  maple,  and  in  the  liquid  contained  in  the  nectaries  of  flowers. 

To  prepare  cane  sugar  the  expressed  juice  of  the  plant  is  heated 
to  100°  with  5  %  of  calcic  hydrate  in  the  form  of  milk  of  lime,  in 
order  to  prevent  the  inverting  action  of  free  acids  and  to  precipitate 
mucous  and  albuminoid  bodies.  To  remove  colouring  matters  the 
liquid  is  filtered  through  thick  layers  of  bone  charcoal,  and  the  nearly 
colourless  liquid  is  then  evaporated  in  vacuo  as  quickly  as  possible, 
and  at  the  lowest  temperature,  until  on  cooling  a  crystalline  mass  is 


510      DERIVATIVES   OF   THE  HEPTAVALENT   RADICALS,  CnH2n_5. 

obtained.  The  crystals  are  purified  commercially  by  washing  with  a 
concentrated  solution  of  sugar. 

By  slow  evaporation  of  concentrated  solutions  saccharose  separates 
in  large  colourless,  monoclinic  crystals  (sugar  candy). 

The  taste  of  cane  sugar  is  extremely  sweet.  It  dissolves  in  one- 
third  of  its  weight  of  cold  water  to  a  colourless  syrup,  and  is  strongly 
dextrorotary  ([a]  =  +  73°-74°).  It  is  nearly  insoluble  in  absolute 
alcohol. 

It  melts  at  160°  and  solidifies  on  cooling  to  a  glassy,  hygroscopic 
mass  (barley  sugar),  which  in  concentrated  aqueous  solution  is  slowly 
transformed  into  crystalline  saccharose.  If  the  melted  sugar  is  kept 
for  a  long  time  at  160°  it  is  decomposed,  without  loss  of  weight,  into 
dextrose  and  lsevulosane  : 

C5H6(OH)4.0.05H6(OH)4       C5H6(OH)5       C5H60(OH)3 

I  I  =1  +1 

CH:0  CH:0  CH:0  CH  :  0 

At  200°  it  evolves  water  and  is  converted  into  caramel,  a  very  bitter, 
strongly  hygroscopic  brown  substance,  which  does  not  combine  with 
water  to  form  sugar.  It  is  a  mixture  of  different  substances,  the 
main  portion  consisting  of  a  body  of  the  formula  C12H1809,  or  some 
multiple  thereof. 

On  stronger  heating  sugar  swells  up  and  is  completely  decomposed. 
It  evolves  gases  (C02,  CO,  CH4,  &c.)  and  vapours  (H20,  acetic  acid, 
aldehyde,  acetone,  and  oils),  and  leaves  a  residue  of  charcoal. 

On  mixing  saccharose  with  concentrated  sulphuric  acid  it  is  con- 
verted, with  evolution  of  much  formic  acid  and  sulphurous  anhydride, 
into  a  black  charred  mass  ;  other  mineral  acids  act  in  a  similar  way. 
When  dilute  they,  as  do  also  strong  organic  acids,  produce  inversion, 
i.e.  decompose  the  saccharose  into  a  mixture  of  equal  molecules  of 
dextrose  and  lsevulose.  Most  ferments  produce  the  same  change  in 
the  first  stage  of  their  action.  The  mixture  of  the  two  aldehyde 
sugars  is  termed  invert  sugar.  It  rotates  the  plane  of  polarisation 
to  the  left,  the  lsevorotary  power  of  hevulose  in  solution  (—  104°) 
considerably  exceeding  the  dextrorotary  power  of  dissolved  dextrose 
(+  56°).  Honey  is  the  saccharose  of  the  nectaries  of  flowers, 
inverted  by  a  ferment  in  the  body  of  the  bee. 

On  heating  saccharose  with  manganic  oxide  and  dilute  sulphuric 
acid  it  yields  much  formic  acid  ;  with  nitric  acid  it  yields  first  saccharic 
acid,  which  is  further  oxidised  to  tartaric  acid,  and  finally,  on  long 
heating  with  nitric  acid,  converted  into  oxalic  acid. 

879.  Metallic  Compounds  of  Cane  Sugar. — Like  all  polyhydric 
alcohols,  cane  sugar,  on  contact  with  metallic  oxides,  can  exchange  a 
portion  of  its  hydrogen  for  metal.  These  compounds  behave  like 
those  of  dextrose,  are  of  basic  reaction,  and  are  decomposed  by  car- 
bonic anhydride. 

Alcoholic  solutions  of  saccharose  and  potassic  hydrate  give  a  pre- 
cipitate of  potassium  saccharose,  C12H21KOn. 

On  mixing  milk  of  lime  with  much  sugar  solution  and  adding 
alcohol  a  precipitate  of  calcium  saccharose,  C12H20CaO11,II2O,  is 
obtained.  By  boiling  an  aqueous  solution  saturated  with  lime 
tricalcium  saccharose,  C^HjyCagOnjSHoO,  precipitates  as  an  amor- 


MILK   SUGAE.  Oil 

phous  powder.  On  mixing  a  solution  of  saccharose  with  plumbic 
acetate  and  carefully  adding  ammonia,  a  precipitate,  at  first  amorphous, 
but  soon  becoming  crystalline,  is  obtained  of  the  formula  : 

^i  2H2oI>b2^i  1  >H20. 
In  presence  of  alkalies  it  dissolves  cupric  oxide,  forming  a  blue  solu- 
tion, from  which  cuprous  oxide  precipitates  slowly  on  boiling. 

Cane  sugar  gives  difficultly  a  crystallisable  compound  with  sodic 
chloride,  C12H22011,NaCl  (as  also  with  similar  salts),  which  tastes  at 
once  sweet  and  saline  and  is  the  cause  of  considerable  loss  of  sugar  in 
its  preparation  from  beet-root. 

Saccharose  Salts. — In  accordance  with  the  formula  : 

[C6H70(OH)4]20, 

eight  hydrogen  atoms  can  be  replaced  in  cane  sugar  on  heating  with 
organic  anhydrides.  Acetic  anhydride  gives  saccharose  octacetate, 
C12H14(C2II302)801  j,  as  a  white  amorphous,  insoluble  mass,  which 
on  heating  with  water  yields  acetic  acid,  dextrose,  and  laevulose. 

Milk  Sugar,  C12H22011,II20. 

880.  Milk  sugar  occurs  only  in  the  milk  of  the  mammalia,  and 
is  obtained  by  precipitating  the  casein  and  fats  with  dilute  acids, 
evaporating  the  whey  to  a  thin  syrup,  and  long  standing  in  a  cool 
place,  when  it  crystallises  out.  It  forms  hard,  colourless,  transparent 
four-sided  prisms,  of  feebly  sweet  taste,  only  dissolving  slowly  in  cold 
water,  requiring  of  the  latter  6  parts,  of  boiling  water  21-  parts,  for 
solution.  The  solution  is  dextrorotary  ([«]  =  +59,3°).  It  is  in- 
soluble in  ether  and  alcohol.  The  water  of  crystallisation  is  given  off 
at  130°,  but  is  regained  on  solution. 

At  170°-180°  milk  sugar  is  converted  with  loss  of  water  into 
lacto-caramel,  C12H20O10,  an  amorphous  brown  powder,  which  can- 
not be  reconverted  into  milk  sugar  by  water,  and  melts  with  decom- 
position at  somewhat  above  200°. 

Milk  sugar  reduces  argentic  oxide  to  metal,  and  alkaline  cupric 
solutions  to  cuprous  oxide.  With  basic  hydrates  it  yields  metallic 
compounds  of  alkaline  reaction,  decomposed  by  carbonic  anhydride. 
By  boiling  with  dilute  acids,  or  by  ferments,  it  is  split  up  into  lactose 
and  a  body  which  appears  to  be  dextrose.  In  consequence  of  this  it 
enters  into  the  alcoholic  fermentation  with  yeast  and  gives  lactic 
acid  with  putrefaction  ferments. 

Bromine  and  water  oxidise  it  to  lactonic  acid,  nitric  acid  to  mucic 
acid  (from  the  lactose)  and  saccharic  acid  (from  the  dextrose),  both  of 
which  are  further  converted  into  tartaric  and  oxalic  acids. 

By  heating  with  acetic  anhydride  the  octacetate  : 

012H14(O.02H3O)8OUl 

is  obtained. 

881.  Jlelizitose,  C12H220j  l5H20,  occurs  in  the  manna  cf  Briancon, 
an  exudation  from  the  young  shoots  of  the  larch  (Larix  europaea), 
and  is  obtained  therefrom  by  extraction  with  alcohol  and  crystallisa- 
tion. It  forms  small,  hard,  brilliant  crystals,  which  dissolve  in  little 
water  and  have  a  very  sweet  taste.     The  solution  is  more  strongly 


512      DERIVATIVES  OF  THE  HEPTAVALENT   RADICALS,  I 

dextrorotary  than  cane  sugar.     Boiling  dilute  acids  invert   melizitose, 
converting  it  into  dextrose. 

Melitose.  C12H22On,3H20,  the  chief  constituent  of  Australian 
eucalyptus  manna,  crystallises  in  fine  interlaced  needles,  of  w 
sweet  taste,  whose  solution  is  dextrorotary.  Alkaline  cupric  solu- 
tions are  not  reduced  by  melitose.  Dilute  acids  and  ferments  invert 
it  into  a  mixture  of  dextrose  and  eucalyne.  On  fermenting  a  solution 
of  melitose  with  yeast  and  evaporation  of  the  liquid,  eucalyne  is  left 
unaltered 

Synantkroee,  Cj2H22On,  is  found  in  the  tnbercules  of  several  of 
the  composite,  e.g.  of  Dahlia   variabilit  and  HeUantl 
together  with  inulin.      It  ifl  amorphoiMi  and  deliquescent.      On   inver- 
sion it   yields  lsevulose  together  with  another  sugar  not  yet  sufficient ly 
characterised. 

881^.  M  II  |j0ni  is  obtained,  together  with  dextrin,  by

roots,  which  further  stand  in  very  clear  relation  to  the  carbo-hydrates, 
and  always  occur  together  with  gam  and  mucilage.     The  chemistry 

of  these  compounds  is  still  very  obscure. 

A  completely  insoluble  body,  pectose,  occurs  in  unripe  fleshy  fruits 
and  roots,  and  is  converted  on  ripening  or  by  long  boiling  into  bodies 
dissolving  in  water,  or  in  part  apparently  dissolving  and  gelatinising 
on  cooling.  The  products  distinguished  as  pectine,  parapectine,  meta- 
pectine,  pectoic  acid,  pectic  acid,  and  parapectic  acid  are  not  sufficiently 
individualised  to  require  further  notice  here.  The  end  product  of  all 
these  metamorphoses,  the  body  termed  meta pectic  acid,  has  lately 
been  shown  to  be  slightly  impure  arabine.

of  tli.'  dry  distillation  of  nitrogenous  organic  matter,  such  as  turf,  coal, 
and  bones.  From  bone  oil  they  were  obtained  by  shaking  with  dilute 
hydrochloric  acid,  when  they  go  into  aqueous  solution  as  hydro- 
chlorides, from  which  thej  sd,  together  with  alkvlanrines,

Uric  Acid,  its  Derivatives  and  Related  Bodies. 

914.  Probably  uric  acid  may  be  considered  as  a  derivative  of  the 
tricarbon  octavalent  nucleus ;  in  any  case  it  stands  in  very  close 
relationship  to  mesoxalic  acid.  Its  composition  is  C5H4N403,  but  in 
what  manner  the  elements  are  united  to  one  another  is  not  yet  known 
with  certainty,  and  the  numerous  constitutional  formulae  proposed  for 
it  require  a  better  foundation. 

The  expression  given  here  can  therefore  have  little  but  hypothe- 
tical value  ;  nevertheless  it  corresponds  best  with  the  numerous  known 
metamorphoses  of  uric  acid. 

Uric  Acid,  C5H4N403. 

915.  Uric  acid  is  a  general  constituent  of  the  urine  of  the  verte- 
brate, and  is  therefore  an  important  product  of  the  retrogressive 
metamorphosis  of  the  nitrogenous  constituents  of  animal  tissue.  It 
occurs  in  only  small  quantity  in  human  and  mammalian  urine,  least 
of  all  in  that  of  herbivore,  whilst  its  acid  amnionic  salt  forms  the 
chief  constituent  of  the  solid  urine  mass  of  birds,  amphibia,  and 
many  insects.  Human  urine  contains  under  normal  circumstances  so 
little  urates  that  they  remain  completely  dissolved  after  cooling,  and 
only  precipitate  some  crystalline  uric  acid  after  acidulation  with 
hydrochloric  acid.  On  greater  secretion  by  the  kidneys  urine  often 
deposits  sediments  of  urates,  or  if  increased  still  more  they  form  con- 
cretions in  the  bladder  (gravel  or  calculi). 

Uric  acid  is  generally  prepared  from  serpents'  excrements  or  from 
guano.  The  first  is  boiled  with  dilute  solution  of  potassic  or  sodic 
hydrate ;  the  hot  filtered  solution  then  contains  the  dibasic  salt,  e.g. 
C5H2K2N403.  On  passing  carbonic  anhydride  one  half  the  metal  is 
removed  and  the  difficultly  soluble  monobasic  salt  precipitated  : 
2C5H2K2N403  +  C02  +  H20  =  K2C03  +  2C5H3KN403, 
and  this  after  washing  decomposed  by  hydrochloric  acid. 


URIC  ACID.  533 

To  prepare  it  from  guano,  the  latter  is  boiled  with  a  solution  of 
one  part  of  borax  in  20  parts  of  water  ;  the  solution,  on  acidulating, 
gives  a  brown  impure  precipitate  of  uric  acid,  which  is  then  purified 
as  in  the  former  method. 

Uric  acid  forms  a  snow-white,  spongy,  micro- crystalline  powder, 
destitute  of  smell  and  taste,  but  reacting  on  vegetable  colours  like  a 
weak  acid.  It  requires  1,800  parts  of  boiling  and  14,000  parts  of  cold 
water  for  solution.     It  is  insoluble  hi  alcohol  and  ether. 

On  heating  with  concentrated  sulphuric  acid  it  dissolves,  and  on 
cooling  yields  deliquescent  crystals  of  C5H4lSr403,2rI2S04,  decomposed 
by  water  into  their  components.  It  gives  two  series  of  salts  with 
the  metals  of  the  alkalies  and  alkaline  earths,  according  as  to  whether 
one  or  two  hydrogen  atoms  are  replaced.  The  first,  monobasic  urates, 
are  formed  by  the  action  of  uric  acid  on  carbonates,  the  dibasic  only 
by  means  of  basic  hydrates.  The  latter  yield  one-half  of  their  metal 
to  carbonic  anhydride. 

Dipotassic  urate,  C5H2K2rT403,  crystallises  in  fine  needles,  soluble 
in  44  parts  of  cold  water  and  of  strongly  alkaline  reaction. 

Potassic  urate,  C5H3KN403,  requires  800  parts  of  water  for 
solution  and  is  of  neutral  reaction.      The  sodic  salts  behave  similarly. 

Amnionic  urate,  C5H3(NH4)N403,  is  formed  by  adding  aqueous 
ammonia  to  uric  acid,  and  frequently  occurs  in  urine.  It  requires 
1,600  parts  of  cold  water  for  solution.  Calcic  diurate,  (C5H3N403)2Ca, 
is  the  most  soluble  of  the  alkaline  earth  salts,  dissolving  in  600  parts 
of  water. 

If  uric  acid  be  evaporated  with  strong  nitric  acid  on  the  water 
bath,  a  yellowish  residue  is  left,  which  is  coloured  purple-red  by 
ammonia  (murexide  reaction). 

On  dry  distillation  uric  acid  yields  much  ammonic  carbonate  and 
hydrocyanic  acid,  together  ay  ith  ammonic  cyanide,  urea,  cyanuric  acid, 
&c,  and  leaves  nitrogenous  charcoal.  By  heating  at  160°  with  con- 
centrated hydriodic  acid  it  is  decomposed  into  carbonic  anhydride, 
ammonic  iodide,  and  glycocine  : 

C5H4N403  +  5H20  +  3HI  =  3C02  +  3NH4I  +  C2H5N02. 

916.  On  oxidation  uric  acid  yields  various  products,  according  as 
it  occurs  in  acid  or  alkaline  solution,  and  whether  the  oxidation  is 
moderate  or  energetic.  These  oxidation  products  all  appear  by  their 
further  reactions  to  be  urea  derivatives  of  acid  radicals ;  urea  and  its 
decomposition  products  are  mostly  formed  at  the  same  time. 

The  oxidation  products  may  be  placed  under  the  following  heads  : — 

1.  In  acid  solution. 

a.  By  moderate  oxidation,  urea  and  alloxan  (mesoxalyl  urea). 

b.  By  vigorous  oxidation,  parabanic  acid  (oxalyl  urea). 

2.  In  alkaline  solution  by  absorption  of  atmospheric  oxygen  there 
are  formed  uroxonic  acid,  C5H8]Sr406,  together  with  oxonic  acid, 
which  readily  decomposes  into  glyoxalyl  urea,  carbonic  anhydride,  and 
ammonia. 

3.  By  plumbic  dioxide  potassic  ferricyanide  or  potassic  perman- 
ganate allantoi'n  is  formed,  which  readily  decomposes  into  urea  and 
hydantoin  (glycolyl  urea). 

It  is  therefore  very  probable  that  uric  acid  contains  a  tricarbon

expressed  by  the  formula  : 

NH.CO

NH-C-NH/ 

There  is  some  reason  to  believe  that  the  collection  of  CO  groups 
round  the  imid  residue  would  cause  the  hydrogen  of  the  latter  to  be 
replaceable  by  metals  (comp.  §  826). 

917.  Alloxan,    C4H2N204,  or  CO'^tt'pqCO,  mesoxalyl  urea,  is 

formed,  together  with  urea,  by  adding  uric  acid  in  small  portions  to 
cooled  nitric  acid  of  sp.  gr.  1*4  as  long  as  the  evolution  of  ruddy 
frames  continues.  The  alloxan,  which  then  separates  as  a  white 
crystalline  powder,  is  collected  on  an  asbestos  filter  and  crystallised 
from  warm  water.  Much  alloxan  is  also  formed  by  the  carefully  con- 
ducted action  of  hydrochloric  acid  and  potassic  chlorate  on  uric  acid. 
The  change  may  be  expressed  by  the  equation  :

From  a  lukewarm  saturated  solution  alloxan  crystallises  in  large 
colourless  rhombic  prisms  of  the  formula  C4H2N204,4U  J  >,  which 
effloresce  in  dry  air  with  loss  of  three  molecules  of  water.  The  com- 
pound C4H2Nv<  >,.II  ,<  >  is  obtained  by  evaporation  of  a  hot  solution  in 
small  monoclinic  crystals,  which  lose  the  last  molecule  of  water  at 
150°  and  then  turn  brown.  Therefore  the  constitutional  formula  of 
alloxan  is  more  probably  :

Dialuric  acid  crystallises  in  long  needles,  which  are  pretty  soluble, 
react  strongly  acid,  and  absorb  oxygen  from  the  air  with  conversion 
into  alloxantin.

C4H2N204  +  C4H4N204  =  H20  +  C8H4N407. 

In  consequence  of  this  it  is  formed  by  passing  sulphuretted  hydrogen

heating  is  decomposed  into  baric  alloxanate  and  dialurate.  At  ordinary 
temperatures  nitric  acid  oxidises  it  to  alloxan.

its  derivatives,  especially  in  some  of  its  hydroxyl,  nitro,  and  amido 
compounds. 

The  hydroxyl  substitution  products  or  hydrates  of  this  series 
correspond  in  many  respects  to  the  alcohols,  only  that  the  hydroxylic 
hydrogen  is  much  more  readily  replaced  by  basic  metals.  Barium, 
calcium,  or  alkali  metal  compounds  may  be  obtained  from  monhy- 
droxy-benzene,  or  phenol,  C6H5.OH,  by  mixing  it  with  aqueous 
solutions  of  the  respective  bases  and  evaporating.  And  it  is  from 
this  readiness  which  phenol  exhibits  to  form  compounds  with  strong 
bases  that  it  obtained  the  name  carbolic  acid,  although  it  has  no  real 
acid  nature,  for  its  basic  compounds  are  easily  decomposed  by  carbonic 
acid  with  reproduction  of  phenol : 

2C6H5.ONa  +  OH2  +  C02  =  Na2C03  +  2C6H5.OH. 

The  hydrates  of  the  benzene  nucleus  occupy  electro  chemically  a  position 
between  the  alcohols  or  carbinols  and  the  acids  proper,  and  are  termed 
1  phenols.'  When,  however,  several  hydrogen  atoms  in  benzene  are 
substituted  by  hydroxyl,  or  by  hydroxyl  and  nitryl  or  halogens,  the 
products  are  of  decidedly  acid  character. 

The  peculiar  chemical  properties  of  the  benzene  group  are  also 
exhibited  in  its  amido  derivatives.  In  the  case  of  alkylamines  (§  264), 
produced  by  the  substitution  of  the  ammonic  hydrogen  atoms  in  am- 
monia by  alcohol  radicals,  the  basic  character  is  intensified  by  each 
such  substitution,  C2H5.NH2  being  more  positive  than  NH3,  and  so 
on.  But  in  the  benzene  amides  the  reverse  is  the  case.  Aniline, 
phenylamine,  C6H5.NH2,  for  instance,  will  form  comparatively  stable 
salts ;  the  salts  of  diphenylamine,  (C6H5)2NH,  are  decomposed  by 
water,  and  triphenylamine,  (C6H5)3N,  does  not  combine  with  acids. 

949.  Isomerism  hi  the  Poly  substituted  Products  of  Benzene. — 
Most  important  support  is  given  to  the  above  view  of  the  constitution 
of  benzene  by  the  study  of  the  isomeric  bodies  produced  by  the  sub- 
stitution of  several  hydrogen  atoms  in  the  benzene  nucleus,  the  differ- 
ences in  physical  and  chemical  properties  being  referable,  as  also  in  the 
case  of  ethane  derivatives,  to  the  relative  position  of  the  substituting 
groups  to  each  other. 

The  simplest  products  result  when  the  substituting  elements  or 
radicals  are  the  same. 

950.  If  two  hydrogen  atoms  in  benzene  be  substituted  by  the  same 
element  or  compound  radical  three  cases  of  isomerism  arise,  depending 
on  the  relative  position  of  these  substituting  elements  or  radicals. 

1.  If  the  substitution  take  place  at  neighbouring  carbon  atoms, 
ortho  derivatives  are  produced,  thus  :

then  these  ortho  derivatives  may  be  designated  by  the  figures

2.  If  one  CH  group  be  situated  between  the  carbon  atoms  at 
which  substitution  has  taken  place,  the  products  are  termed  meta 
derivatives,  and  may  be  represented  by  the  convention  of  numbering 
thus:  X:X=l:3or  1:5  :

In  such  bodies  two  CH  groups  occupy  positions  between  the  car- 
bons at  which  substitution  has  taken  place. 

It  was  assumed  by  Kekule  that  the  positions  represented  by  the 
numbers  1  and  2  were  identical  with  1  and  6,  and  so  on ;  so  that  only 
three  isomers  of  a  disubstituted  benzene  could  exist.  The  identity  of 
these  positions  has,  however,  been  disputed,  for  it  will  be  observed  in 
the  figure  that  in  one  case  the  carbon  atoms  are  united  by  double 
bonds  and  in  the  other  by  single  only,  and  if  this  could  cause  any 
physical  or  chemical  difference  four  isomeric  modifications  of  disub- 
stituted benzenes  should  exist ;  but  direct  experiments  appear  to  show 
that  if  a  substance  has  been  prepared  by  methods  so  devised  as  to  lead 


560 


AROMATIC   COMPOUNDS. 


to  the  two  replacing  groups  occupying  the  positions   1  :  2  and   1  :  6 
respectively,  the  body  obtained  by  both  methods  is  identical. 

951.  In  the  case  of  the  trisubstitution  derivatives  of  benzene, 
where  the  substituting  agent  is  the  same,  only  three  isomers  are 
possible. 

1 .  One  product  with  neighbouring  positions  : 

1.2.3. 

2.  One  product  with  two  positions  adjacent : 

1.2.4. 

3.  One  product  not  containing  neighbouring  positions  : 

1.3.5. 
It  has  been  proposed  to  term  these  three  isomeric  forms  con- 
secutive, unsymmetrical,  and  symmetrical,  the  meaning  of  these  terms 
being  clearly  shown  by  the  formula  given  below  :

Unsymmetrical. 

Symmetrica] 

In  these  abridged  formulae,  which  are  frequently  used,  the  hexagon 
represents  the  benzene  nucleus,  i.e.  the  six  carbon  atoms,  and  such 
hydrogen  atoms  as  are  still  unreplaced. 

It  is  more  complicated  when  only  two  of  the  three  substituting 
elements  or  radicals  ai-e  alike,  e.g.  C6H3X2Y,  and  still  more  so  when 
all  three  are  unlike,  e.g.  C6H3.X.Y.Z. 

In  the  latter  case  no  less  than  ten  isomers  must  occur,  the 
positions  1.2.3  giving  three  isomers  in  the  order  X.Y.Z.,  X.Z.Y., 
Y.X.Z.,  whilst  1.2.4  would  s^ive  six  isomers  in  the  order  X.Y.Z., 
X.Z.Y.,  Z.Y.X.,  Z.X.Y.,  Y.Z.X.,  and  Y.X.Z.,  and  1.3.5  would 
correspond  to  only  one  isomer. 

952.  Four  similar  groups  or  elements  substituting  in  benzene 
give  rise  to  the  same  number  of  isomers  as  with  the  disubstitution 
products,  for  C6H2X4  and  C6H4X2  have  the  same  relation  to  each 
other. 

The  isomers  would  be  1:2:3:4,  1:2:4:5,  and  1:3:4:5. 

The  same  relationship  exists  between  the  penta-substituted  and 
mono-substituted  benzenes : 

C6HX5  and  C6H5X, 

so  that  only  one  modification  can  exist,  and  so  likewise  with  a  com- 
pletely substituted  benzene,  C6X6,  as  long  as  the  replacing  elements  or 
groups  are  similar.  Very  complicated  cases  of  isomerism  arise  where 
in  poly-substituted  benzenes  all  the  entering  radicals  are  dissimilar  ; 
and  in  these  cases  the  individual  isomers  are  the  more  difficult  to 
separate  and  distinguish  the  greater  their  number,  in  consequence  of 
slighter  differences  in  chemical  and  physical  character:  so  that  the 
investigation  of  these  relationships  is  confined  within  very  narrow 
limits.

953.  Incrtasi  in  Xumber  of  Isomers  by  Substitution  in  Side 
Chains. — By  substituting  hydrocarbons  for  the  hydrogen  in  benzene  a 
much  greater  number  and  variety  of  isomeric  bodies  may  be  obtained, 
since,  in  addition  to  the  benzene  hydrogen  atoms,  the  hydrogen  of  the 
substituting  hydrocarbon  groups  may  be  replaced. 

With  methyl  benzene  or  toluene,  for  instance,  the  substitution  may 
take  place  either  in  the  benzene  nucleus,  C6H4X.CH3,  or  in  the 
methyl,  C6H5.CH2.X,  and  so  on. 

Determination  of  Position  Isomers  in  the  Benzene  Nucleus. 

954.  The  determination  of  the  places  or  points  of  substitution  in 
polj-substitution  derivatives  of  benzene  has  been  carried  out  with  con- 
siderable certaiuty,  mostly  with  di-derivatives  and  to  a  less  extent  with 
tri-derivatives. 

Some  few  only  of  the  leading  arguments  concerning  the  determina- 
tion of  these  points  of  substitution  in  benzene  derivatives  can  be  given 
here. 

As  mono-substitution  products  give  no  isomers,  and  di-substitution 
products  at  most  three,  it  is  only  necessary  to  determine  to  which 
series,  ortho,  meta,  or  para,  the  derivative  body  belongs. 

The  most  general  reference  in  use  with  respect  to  di-derivatives  of 
benzene  has  been  to  the  constitution  of  the  three  isomeric  benzene  di- 

carboxylic  acids,  C6H4Y<q'qtt>  phthalic,  isophthalic,  and  terephthalic 

acids,  the  first  being  considered  as  in  the  ortho  position  =  1:2;  the 
second  as  meta,  1:3;  and  tbe  last  as  the  pan  compound,  1:4;  and, 
so  far  as  it  has  been  possible  to  convert  any  other  di-substitution 
product  of  benzene  into-  any  one  of  these  acids  by  any  moderately 
easy  and  direct  process,  these  compounds  have  been  looked  upon  as 
belonging  to  the  same  series,  ortho,  m  he  case  might  be. 

But  this  method  is  not  always  reliable  or  definite,  as  it  happens 
sometimes  that  the  same  body  will,  after  treatment  and  parsing 
through  various  intermediate  compounds  and  stages,  give  more  than 
one  acid  of  the  formula  C6H4  :  (CO.OH)2,  this  being  especially  the 
case  when  very  high  temperatures  have  been  employed,  under  the 
influence  of  which,  as  has  been  proved,  one  isomeric  state  may  change 
or  pass  into  another  of  a  more  stable  kind  under  those  conditions. 

A  strong  argument  for  the  assignment  of  the  ortho  position  to 
phthalic  acid  is  its  production  from  naphthalene,  Cj0H8,  by  oxidation. 
The  probable  constitution  of  this  body,  and  the  resulting  phthalic  acid, 
according  to  Grsebe,  is  : 

H.C       C.H  H.C 

/s/\  f\

This  view  of  the  constitution  of  phthalic  acid  is  also  supported  by 
the  fact  that  it  alone  of  the  three  benzene  dicarboxylic  acids  yields  an

anhydride,  H4C6>p~Q(^>0,  by  simply  heating,  in  an  analogous  man- 
ner to  male'ic  and  succinic  acids,  and  again  by  the  ease  with  which  it 
is  totally  oxidised  to  water  and  carbonic  acid  by  chromic  acid. 

This  last  property  seems  especially  to  characterise  ortho  compounds 
in  which  the  substituting  groups  already  contain  oxygen  or  hydro- 
carbon radicals. 

It  appears,  indeed,  to  be  a  general  fact  that  oxidation  takes  place 
with  the  greatest  ease  at  those  carbon  atoms  or  groups  to  which 
oxygen  or  carboxyl  groups  are  already  attached,  and  especially  also 
when  at  the  same  time  the  neighbouring  carbon  atoms  are  connected 
by  divalent  union,  as  in  this  case. 

The  meta  position  is  assigned  to  the  carboxyl  group  in  isophthalic 
acid  on  account  of  its  derivation  from  mesitylene,  C6H3.(CH3)3.  This 
body  results  from  the  abstraction  of  three  molecules  of  water  from 
three  molecules  of  acetone,  CH3.CO.CH3,  under  the  influence  of  sul- 
phuric acid,  and  similarly  from  three  molecules  of  allylene. 

In  the  latter  case  the  process  may  be  thus  represented  :

Mesitylene. 

Of  the  two,  1  seems  the  most  rational,  as  in  this  case  each  of  the 
three  acetone  molecules  behaves  in  a  similar  manner,  the  product 
being  therefore  symmetrical  as  expressed  by  the  position  numbers 
1  :  3  :  5  ;  and,  further,  it  has  been  shown  that  all  three  hydrogen  atoms 
still  attached  to  the  benzene  nucleus  have  the  same  value,  i.e.  in  the 
case  of  mono-substitution  products  it  is  a  matter  of  indifference  which 
hydrogen  atom  is  substituted  ;  this  would  only  be  the  case  with  a  body 
of  the  first  formula. 

By  gentle  oxidation  mesitylene  yields  mesitylenic  acid  : 

n  tt  :(CH3)2 
^6n3COOH 

which  on  distillation  with  calcic  hydrate  splits  up  into  carbonic  acid 
and  a  dimethyl  benzene,  or  isoxylene,  C6H4  :  (CH3)2  in  which,  from 
the  method  of  its  production,  the  two  methyl  groups  occupy  the 
positions  1:3. 

According  to  the  first  of  the  above  formulae  of  mesitylene,  isoxylene 


POSITION   ISOMEKISM.  563 

can  only  have  this  meta  constitution,  and  therefore  the  isophthalic  acid 
obtained  from  it  by  oxidation  is  considered  to  be  benzene  meta-dicar- 
boxylic  acid.  These  relations  may  perhaps  be  better  seen  by  com- 
paring the  three  formulae  :

If  the  above  deductions  be  correct  terephthalic  acid  can  only 
occupy  the  remaining  or  para  position  in  the  benzene  nucleus. 

954rt.  A  further  method  of  determining  the  relative  positions  to 
be  aligned  to  the  various  replacing  elements  or  groups  in  the  disub- 
stitution  derivatives  of  benzene  has  lately  been  devised  by  Korner, 
which  is  free  from  the  objections  raised  against  the  previous  methods, 
inasmuch  as  high  temperatures  are  not  employed.  It  consists  in 
determining  the  number  of  tri- substitution  derivatives  that  can  be 
derived  from  or  converted  into  any  di-substitution  derivative  of  ben- 
zene. 

In  the  case  of  an  ortho  compound  it  will  be  possible  to  obtain  two

In  those  cases  where  the  fresh  substituting  group  or  element  was

In  those  cases,  on  the  other  hand,  where  the  third  replacing  group  is 
different  from  that  occurring  in  the  di-derivative,  and  where,  therefore, 
six  tri-derivatives  are  possible,  these  bodies  would  be  all  different.  For 
instance,  taking  the  nitro-dibrom  benzenes  :

This  has  been  carefully  worked  out  for  the  dibrom-benzenes,  and 
it  is  further  found  that  dibrom-benzene  which  gives  only  a  single 
tri-derivative  can  be  converted  by  simple  means  into  terephthalic  acid, 
and  similarly  that  the  dibrom-benzene  giving  rise  to  three  tri-deriva- 
tives is  convertible  into  isophthalic  acid,  thus  fully  corroborating  the 
previous  ideas  that  terephthalic  acid  was  a  para  (1.4)  compound, 
isophthalic  a  meta  (1  .  3)  compound,  and  leaving  the  ortho  (1  .  2)  as  the 
only  position  for  phthalic  acid.

BENZENE  AND  ITS  SUBSTITUTION   DERIVATIVES   BY 
CARBON  FREE  RADICALS. 

Benzene,  C6H6. 

955.  Benzene  is  obtained  synthetically  by  passing  acetylene 
through  tubes  heated  to  whiteness  (§  947,  1),  and  this  probably 
explains  its  occurrence  amongst  the  fluid  products  of  the  dry  distilla- 
tion of  many  organic  bodies.  Many  dense  hydrocarbons  and  homo- 
logues  of  benzene  also  yield  that  body  on  exposure  to  a  very  high 
temperature,  which  may  possibly  account  for  its  presence  in  coal-tar 
oil  along  with  many  of  its  homologues,  with  phenols,  aniline,  pyridine 
bases,  and  solids  like  naphthalene,  anthracene,  phenanthrene,  &c. 

Chemically  pure  benzene  may  be  prepared  by  carefully  distilling 
calcic  benzoate  or  benzoic  acid  with  quick- lime  : 

C6H5.CO.OH  +  CaO  =  CaC03  +  C6H6, 

and  similarly  by  distilling  the  polybasic  benzoic  acids  with  excess  of 
calcic  oxide,  e.g. 

C6H3(C0.0H)3  +  3CaO  =  3CaC03  +  C6H6 ; 

also  by  passing  its  hydroxyl  substitution  derivatives  over  strongly 
heated  zinc  dust : 

C6H5.0H  +  Zn  =  ZnO  +  C6H6. 

On  the  manufacturing  scale  benzene  is  always  obtained  from  the  coal- 
tar  oil  boiling  below  100°. 

Coal  tar  is  separated  by  distillation  into  three  principal  fractions. 

1.  Light  oil:  is  lighter  than  water,  principally  contains  benzene 
and  its  homologues. 

2.  Heavy  oil :  sinks  in  water  and  consists  principally  of  phenols 
and  volatile  bases  and  naphthaline. 

3.  Solid  hydrocarbons. 

The  light  oil  is  treated  in  rotation  with  sulphuric  acid,  strong 
potash  solution,  and  water  to  remove  bases  and  phenols,  and  the 
remaining  oily  portion  fractionally  distilled  several  times ;  the 
portion  between  80°  and  90°  is  then  treated  with  about  y1^  of  its 
weight  of  concentrated  sulphuric  acid,  and  digested  with  this  for  some 
hours  in  order  to  remove  hydrocarbons  of  the  CnH2n  and  CnH2n2 
series.  It  is  then  washed  with  water,  and  the  treatment  repeated  if 
strong  sulphuric  acid  causes  any  blackening  when  warmed  with  it. 
It  is  again  fractionally  distilled  and  the  portion  under  90°  sub- 
mitted to  a  freezing  mixture,   when   the  benzene  crystallises.     The 


566  BENZENE. 

crystals  are  pressed  at  a  low  temperature  to  remove  liquid  homologues 
and  the  crystallisation  repeated  sevei-al  times. 

At  the  ordinary  temperature  benzene  is  a  mobile,  colourless  liquid, 
of  peculiar  odour,  quickly  causing  headache  if  breathed,  of  sp.  gr.  '899 
at  0°.  It  forms  large  fern-shaped  crystals,  which  melt  at  5*5°.  It 
boils  at  80*5°  and  has  a  vapour  density  of  2-675.  It  is  scarcely 
soluble  in  water,  to  which,  however,  it  imparts  its  odour,  but  is  soluble 
in  alcohol  and  ether  in  all  proportions.  On  gently  heating  it  dis- 
solves in  506  times  its  bulk  of  sulphuric  acid.  Benzene  is  largely 
used  as  a  solvent  for  caoutchouc  and  guttapercha,  resins,  fats,  &c.  ; 
it  also  dissolves  phosphorus,  sulphur,  iodine,  and  many  organic  bodies. 
It  evaporates  very  rapidly  even  at  a  low  temperature,  and  burns  in 
air  with  a  highly  luminous,  smoky  flame.  Benzene  vapour  passed 
through  a  red-hot  tube  yields  diphenyl  and  hydrogen  : 

2C6H6  =  C6H5.C6H5  +  H2 ; 

paradiphenyl-benzene,  and  small  quantities  of  other  products  if  the 
benzene  be  slightly  impure.  It  forms  an  explosive  compound  with 
potassium  when  heated  with  it  to  250°. 

Most  oxidising  agents  completely  oxidise  benzene  to  carbonic  anhy- 
dride and  water.  Chromylic  chloride,  Cr02Cl2,  however,  gives  in  acetic 
solution  a  trichlor-quinone,  CGHC1302.  When  gently  heated  with 
sulphuric  acid  and  manganic  oxide,  carbonic  and  formic  acid  are 
produced,  and  very  small  quantities  of  benzoic  and  phthalic  acids. 
By  heating  for  a  long  time  to  about  300°  with  concentrated  fuming 
hydric  iodide  containing  a  small  quantity  of  free  iodine,  it  is  con- 
verted into  hexane,  C6H14. 

Addition  Products  of  Benzene. 

956.  On  exposing  a  mixture  of  benzene  with  bromine  to  sunlight, 
or  on  passing  excess  of  chlorine  gas  into  benzene,  also  in  sunlight,  two 
kinds  of  products  are  formed,  addition  products  (§  9-47,  2)  and  sub- 
stitution products. 

Of  the  former  the  compounds  C,;lI6Br6  and  C6H6C16  are  the 
end  products  of  the  action  of  these  two  reagents.  Intermediate  bodies, 
C6H6Br2,  C6H6Br4,  ttc,  no  doubt  exist  in  the  crude  product,  but  have 
not  been  isolated  with  certainty. 

The  bodies  C6H6Br6  and  C6H6C1G  are  colourless  crystalline  solids, 
insoluble  in  water,  which  decompose  on  heating  : 

C6H6Br6  =  3HBr  +  C6H3Br3. 

This  reaction  takes  place  with  still  greater  ease  when  they  are 
heated  with  alkalies  (§  471). 

Benzene  hexachloride,  C6H6C16,  melts  at  157°,  dissolves  in  warm 
alcohol,  ether,  and  benzene,  from  which  it  crystallises  in  large  needles. 
zen*  ht  xabromidt .  C6H6Br6,  cannot  be  melted  without  decom- 
position, and  is  much  more  insoluble  than  the  chlorine  compound. 

By  the  action  of  a  cold  aqueous  solution  of  chlorous  acid  on  benzene 
for  some  days,  a 

Benzene  tricldor  trxhydraie^  ( 'i;llt;(  l3(OH)3,  is  produced.  It  is 
extracted  from  the  mixture  by  shaking  with  ether,  and  forms  colour- 
less plates  melting  at  10°,  nearly  insoluble  in  water,  but  dissolving  in 


MONO-SUBSTITUTION  PRODUCTS.  567 

most  other  solvents.  On  warming  with  dilute  sodic  hydrate  solution 
it  passes  into 

Phenose,  benzene  hexa  hydrate,  CGH6(OH)6,  an  amorphous  hygro- 
scopic body,  which  gives  secondary  hexyl  iodide,  CGH13I,  on  heating  to 
120°  with  hydric  iodide. 

Mono-substitution  Derivatives  of  Benzene  or 
Phenyl  Compounds. 

957.  Haloid  Derivatives. — Chlorine  and  bromine  displace  hy- 
drogen in  benzene  at  the  ordinary  temperature,  especially  in  the 
presence  of  iodine.  The  first  products,  C6H5C1  and  C6H5Br,  readily 
pass  into  the  higher  haloid  bodies,  from  which  they  require  to  be 
separated  by  distillation.  Iodo-benzene  can  only  be  obtained  by  the 
simultaneous  action  of  iodine  and  iodic  acid  on  benzene  : 

5C6H6  +  21 2  +  HI03  ==  5CGH5I  +  3H20. 

The  reaction  requires  a  temperature  of  about  200°.  All  the  mono- 
haloid  compounds  may  be  easily  obtained  by  the  action  of  haloid 
phosphorus  compounds  on  phenol  : 

C6H5.OH  +  PCI,  =  POCI3  +  HC1  +  CGH5C1. 

The  reaction  : 

C6H5.OH  +  HC1  =H20  +  C6H5C1, 

is  very  difficult  to  obtain  and  requires  a  temperature  of  at  least  200°. 

Monochlor-benzt  ne,  phenyl  chloride,  C6H5C1,  is  a  colourless  liquid  ; 
it  boils  at  132°,  sp.  gr.  PI 28  at  0°. 

Mouohroin-he nzt ewe,  phenyl  bromide,  CGH5Br,  boils  at  154°,  sp. 
gr.   1517. 

Moniod-benzene,  phenyl  iodide,  CGH5I,  boils  at  185°,  sp.  gr. 
P69. 

Monofluor-bcniene,  phenyl  fluoride,  C6H5F1,  obtained  by  distilling 
miobenzoie  acid  with  lime,  melts  at  40°  and  boils  a  little  above  180°. 

Oxygen  Derivatives. 

958.  Hydroxy-benzene,  phenyl  hydrate,  phenol  or  carbolic  acid, 
C6H5.OH,  ocelli's  in  heavy  coal-tar  oil,  in  castor  oil  (castoreum),  and 
in  the  urine  of  herbivorous  animals. 

It  is  obtained  from  heavy  tar  oil  by  shaking  with  strong  soda 
solution,  in  which  it  dissolves  to  form  the  compound  C6H5.OXa. 
The  aqueous  layer  is  separated  from  the  neutral  oils,  and  the  phenol 
precipitated  by  neutralising  with  hydric  chloride.  The  crude  product, 
containing  cresol  and  other  phenols,  is  then  dried  by  means  of  calcic 
chloride  and  distilled.  The  fraction  obtained  between  180°  and  190° 
crystallises  on  cooling,  the  crystals  being  separated  by  pressure  and 
filtration  from  the  portions  remaining  in  a  liquid  state. 

Pure  phenol  forms  large  colourless  prisms,  which  melt  at  -40°,  have 
a  peculiar  smoky  odour  and  burning  taste,  dissolve  in  15  parts  of 
water  at  the  ordinary  temperature  and  in  all  proportions  in  alcohol 
and  ether.  It  boils  at  183°  and  has  sp.  gr.  P08  at  0°.  It  acts  very 
powerfully  on  the  skin,  completely  destroying  it,  and  acts  as  an  ener- 


568  PHENOL. 

getic  poison  to  plants  and  animals,  germs,  &c,  and  for  this  reason  is 
largely  employed  as  a  disinfectant  and  antiseptic  to  prevent  decom- 
position and  putrefaction  in  organic  substances.  The  efficacy  of  the 
meat-smoking  process  depends  essentially  on  the  presence  of  small 
quantities  of  phenol  in  the  smoke. 

An  aqueous  phenol  solution  gives  a  beautiful  violet  reaction  with 
ferric  chloride  and  a  white  precipitate  of  tribrom-phenol,  C6H2Br3.OH, 
even  in  veiy  dilute  solutions  when  mixed  with  bromine  water. 

959.  Phenylates. — These  bodies  are  the  metallic  derivatives  of 
phenol ;  they  correspond  to  the  alkylates,  and  are  derived  from 
phenol  by  the  action  of  basic  oxides  and  hydrates.  They  are  decom- 
posed even  by  carbonic  acid. 

The  alkaline  phenylates  are  obtained  by  simply  dissolving  phenol 
in  the  alkaline  hydrate  solution.  They  are  white  crystalline  bodies, 
soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether.  Sodium  phenylate,  C6H5.ONa,  is  more 
soluble  than  the  potassic  compound.  Baric  and  calcic  phenylates  are 
also  crystalline  soluble  compounds. 

960.  Phenyl  ether,  oxydibenzene,  diphenyl  oxide,  C6H5.O.C6H5, 
is  obtained  by  mixing  diazo-benzene  sulphate  (§  977)  and  phenol, 
and  together  with  other  products  by  the  dry  distillation  of  cupric 
benzoate.  It  crystallises  in  long  colourless  needles,  melting  at  28° 
and  boiling  at  246°,  and  is  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether,  but  not  in 
water. 

By  heating  potassic  phenylate  with  alkyl  iodides,  the  alkyl  phenyl 
ethers  are  formed  : 

C6H5.O.K  +  ICnH2+1  =  KI  +  CGH5.O.CnH2n+1. 

They  are  all  colourless  liquids,  insoluble  in  water,  and  which  may  be 
distilled.  On  heating  with  strong  hydric  iodide  to  130°  they  are  re- 
converted into  alkyl  iodide  and  phenol. 

Methyl-phenyl-ether,  anisol,  CH3.O.C6H5,  is  prepared  by  distilling 
anisic  acid  with  baric  hydrate  : 

C6H<caOH   +  Ba(0H)2  =  BaC03  +  OH2  +  C6H5.O.CH3. 

It  boils  at  152°. 

Ethyl-phenyl-ether,  C6H5.O.C9H5,  boils  at  172°.  Isoamyl-phenyl- 
ether,  C5Hn.O.C6H5,  boils  at  225°. 

Etkylene-diphenyl-ether,  C2H4(O.C6H5)2,  obtained  from  ethylene 
dibromide  and  sodium  phenylate,  melts  at  95°. 

961.  Ethereal  Salts  of  Phenol. — Acids  do  not  yield  salts  with 
phenol  directly,  but  salts  may  be  obtained  from  the  anhydrides  and 
acid  chlorides. 

Phenyl  phosphates,  C6H5.H2P04  and  (C6H5)2HP04,  are  prepared 
from  phosphoric  anhydride  and  phenol.  (C6H5)3P04  is  obtained  by 
the  action  of  phosphoric  chloride  on  phenol.  Acetylic  chloride  acting  on 
phenol  gives  phenylic  actate,  C6H5.O.CO.CH3,  a  colourless  liquid 
boiling  at  193°.  Carbonic  oxjchloride  gives  a  phenylic  carbonate, 
(C6H50)2CO,  forming  shining  colourless  needles,  melting  at  78°. 

Sulphur  Derivatives. 

962.  Hydro-thiobenzene,  phenyl  mercaptan,   C6H5.SH,    prepared 


PHENYL  MERCAPTAN.  569 

by  the  action  of  phosphoric  sulphide  on  phenol,  and  by  the  reduction 
of  phenyl  sulpho-chloride  with  zinc  and  hydric  chloride  : 

06H5.S02C1  +  3H2  =  20H2  +  HC1  +  C6H5.SH, 

is  a  colourless  stinking  oil  of  sp.  gr.  l-078  and  boiling  point  166°- 
168°.  With  sodium  it  forms  C6H5.SNa,  and  gives  a  mercury  com- 
pound by  heating  its  alcoholic  solution  with  mercuric  oxide  : 

(C6H5.S)2Hg, 

which  on  heating  gives  HgS  and 

Diphenyl  sulphide,  C6H5.S.C6rI5,  a  colourless,  disagreeably  smell- 
ing oil  of  boiling  point  292°.  It  is  also  formed  during  the  preparation 
of  phenyl  mercaptan. 

Diphenyl  disulphide,  C6H5.S2.C6H5,  is  obtained  by  the  decompo- 
sition of  sodium  thio-phenylate  with  iodine  (§  242),  and  from  the 
mercaptan  by  oxidation  with  dilute  nitric  acid,  or  with  atmospheric 
oxygen  in  ammoniacal  solution  : 

2C6H5.SH  +  O  =  OH2  +  (C6H5.S)2. 

It  forms  colourless  crystals  melting  at  62°,  soluble  in  alcohol  and 
ether. 

963.  Phenyl-sulphonic  acid,  benzene  monosulphonic  acid: 

C6H5.S02.OH, 

is  produced  by  the  oxidation  of  phenyl  mercaptan  or  pheDyl  sulphide 
with  dilute  nitric  acid,  and  by  the  solution  of  benzene  in  weak  fuming 
sulphuric  acid.  In  the  latter  case  it  is  separated  from  the  excess  of 
sulphuric  acid  by  dilution  with  water  and  saturation  of  the  solution 
with  baric  or  plumbic  carbonates. 

Baric phenyl-sulphonate,  (C6H5.S02.0)2Ba,OH2,  forms  pearly  crys- 
tals, whose  aqueous  solution,  on  exact  neutralisation  with  sulphuric 
acid,  gives  the  free  sulphonic  acid,  which  may  be  obtained  on  evapora- 
tion in  four-sided  tables  of  the  formula  (C6H5.S02.OH)2,30H2. 

The  potassic  salt  of  this  acid,  when  fused  with  potash,  gives 
potassic  phenylate  : 

G6H5.S02.OK  +  2KOH  =  K2S03  +  OH2  +  C6H5.OK, 

affording  a  means  by  which  benzene  can  be  directly  converted  into 
phenol. 

On  warming  an  intimate  mixture  of  the  sodium  salt  of  the  acid 
with  phosphoric  chloride  and  subsequent  treatment  with  water 

Phenyl  sulpho-chloride,  C6H5.S02C1,  is  produced  as  a  colourless, 
heavy  oil ;  it  is  crystalline  below  0°  and  boils  at  246°-247°. 

It  is  slowly  decomposed  by  boiling  with  water  into  phenyl 
sulphonic  and  hydrochloric  acids,  and  is  converted  by  tin  and  hydro- 
chloric acid  into  phenyl  mercaptan,  and  by  ammonia  into  phenyl 
sulphonamide,  C6H5.S02.NH2.  This  latter  forms  colourless  plates 
melting  at  149°. 

Phenyl  sulpho-chloride,  when  treated  with  sodium  amalgam  in 
ethereal  solution,  gives  sodic  chloride  and  the  sodium  salt  of  phenyl 
sidph  inic  add  : 

C6HVS02C1  +  Na2  +  NaCI  +  C6H5.S02Na, 


570  NITKO-BENZENE. 

from  which  the  free  acid,  C6H5.S02H,  can  be  obtained  in  large 
prisms,  difficultly  soluble  in  cold  water  and  melting  at  68°-69°.  It 
is  easily  oxidised  to  the  sulphonic  acid,  and  is  converted  into  phenyl 
sulpho-chloride  by  chlorine. 

Sulpho-benzide,  diphenyl-sulphuryl,  (C6IT5)2S02,  is  formed  by  the 
action  of  sulphuric  anhydride  on  benzene  : 

2C6H6  +  2S03  =  (C6H5)2S02  +  H2S04, 

and  by  oxidation  of  diphenyl  sulphide  with  chromic  acid.  It  crystallises 
from  alcohol  in  colourless  rhombic  tables,  almost  insoluble  in  boiling 
water,  melting  at  128°,  and  distilling  without  change. 

Nitrogen  Derivatives. 

964.  Nitro-benzene,  C6H5.N02,  is  made  by  gradually  adding 
benzene  to  cold  fuming  nitric  acid  so  long  as  it  dissolves  : 

C6H6  +  HO.N02  =  OH2  +  C6H5.N02, 

and  then  precipitating  with  water.  The  oily  product  is  washed  with 
soda  solution  and  distilled.  When  pure  it  is  a  light  yellow  oil, 
which  may  be  obtained  in  crystals  at  a  low  temperature,  and  then 
melts  at  3°  ;  it  boils  unchanged  at  205° ;  its  sp.  gr.  =1*2  at  0°.  It 
is  used  in  perfumery  under  the  name  of  essence  of  niirbane,  and  is 
manufactured  in  enormous  quantities  for  the  preparation  of  aniline 
and  its  derivatives.- 

Aniline. 

965.  Amido-benzene,  phenylamine,  aniline,  C6H5.NH2,  is  found 
in  the  higher  distillates  from  coal-tar  oil,  from  which  it  may  be  re- 
moved along  with  other  bases  by  shaking  with  diluted  sulphuric  acid. 
Aniline  may  be  obtained  by  a  variety  of  methods,  some  of  which 
will  be  described  in  full  further  on. 

The  phenylamine  or  aniline  used  for  the  production  of  the  so- 
called  aniline  colours  is  obtained  by  the  reduction  of  crude  nitro- 
benzene with  nascent  hydrogen  : 

C,H5.N02  +  3H2  +  20H2  +  C6H5.NH2. 

This  takes  place  very  easily  in  an  acid  solution — hydrochloric  or 
sulphuric  acid,  <£c,  with  tin  or  zinc,  or  iron  and  acetic  acid— or  in 
alkaline  solution  with  arsenious  oxide  and  grape  sugar.  The  most 
general  method  is  with  iron  and  acetic  acid — 1  part  of  nitro-benzene, 
1  part  of  concentrated  acetic  acid,  and  1*2  part  of  iron  filings  or 
turnings.     The  product  is  finally  distilled  over  quick-lime. 

Aniline  is  a  liquid  of  faint  and  peculiar  odour,  of  sp.  gr.  1'036  at 
0°.  When  perfectly  pure  it  may  be  crystallised  on  strongly  cooling, 
and  then  melts  at  —  8°.  It  boils  at  1 84°,  dissolves  in  3 1  parts  of  wai  er 
and  in  all  proportions  in  alcohol  and  ether.  Its  aqueous  solution 
gives  a  purple  violet  reaction  with  bleaching  powder  solution.  With 
chromic  acid  it  produces  a  red  colour  passing  into  blue.  These  re- 
actions, which  are  probably  due  to  salts  of  phenvlene  hydrazo-ainido- 
benzene  (§  987),  are  used  for  the  detection  of  aniline. 

Aniline  dissolves  potassium  with  liberation  of  hydrogen  and  forms 


ANILINE.  571 

mono-potassium  aniline,  (C6H5)NHK,  and  probably  dipotassium 
aniline,  (C6H5)NK2. 

Aniline  salts,  when  warmed  with  an  equivalent  quantity  of 
argentic  nitrite,  are  reduced  to  phenol  with  liberation  of  nitrogen  : 

C6H5.NH,HC1  +  NOOAg  =  AgCl  -f  OH2  +  N2  +  C6H5.OH 

(comp.  diazo-benzene,  §  976). 

966.  Chemically  aniline  behaves  very  similarly  to  ammonia, 
combining  with  acids  to  form  salts  noluble  in  water  and  alcohol,  and 
in  many  cases  isomorphous  with  ammonic  salts. 

Aniline  hydrochloride,  N(C6H5)H3C1,  forms  colourless  needles, 
which  can  be  sublimed.  It  combines  with  platinic  chloride  to  a 
difficultly  soluble  salt,  [N(C6H5)H3],PtCl6. 

Anil  hie  nitrate,  N(06H5)H3O.N02,  crystallines  in  rhombic  tables 
and  prisms. 

The  acetate  does  not  crystallise.  The  oxalate,  (N.C6H5.H3)2C204, 
forms  shining  prisms. 

The  aniline  compounds  with  the  chlorides  of  mercury,  tin,  antimony, 
tfcc,  correspond  to  the  ammonia  compounds. 

967.  Alkyl  haloids  combine  with  aniline  even  in  the  cold  to  form 
haloid  salts  of  a  phenyl-alkyl-ammonium  : 

N(C6H5)H2  +  CnH2n+1.l  =  N(C6H5)(CnH2n+1)H2I, 

from  which  aqueous  alkalies  liberate  phenyl-alkylamines ;  and  on 
repeating   the  operation   on   these   bodies   diaUtyl~phenylaminea  are 

produced,    from    which     again     triaUtyl-phenyl-ammowium     io<U</rs 

can  be  obtained.  These  treated  with  argentic  hydrate  give  the 
soluble  and  strongly  alkaline  triaUcyl-phenylanwnonic  hydrates, 
N(C6H5)(CnH2?+1),OH. 

Methyl-aniline,  methyl-phenylamme,  N(CbH-J)CH3H,  boils  at 
192°. 

Dimethyl-aniline,  N(C6H5)(CH3)2,  boils  at  192°;  sp.gr.  "955.  It 
is  also  obtained  bv  heating  aniline  hydrocklorate  with  methyl  alcohol 
to  U50°. 

Ethylroniline,  N(C6H5)C2H5.H,  boils  at  204°.     Sp.  gr.  -954. 

Diethyl-aniline,  NC6H,(C,>H5)2,  boils  at  213°.     Sp.  gr.  -939. 

Ethyl-isoumyl-uniline,  ]Sr(C6H5)(C2H5)(C.5H11),  boils  at  262°. 

Ethylene-diphenyLdiamine,  C2H4(N(C6H5)H)2  (m.p.  59°),  is 
formed  by  the  action  of  excess  of  aniline  on  ethylene  dibrumide. 
When  an  excess  of  ethylene  dibromide  is  employed,  polyethylene 
phenyl  nitrile  bases  result,  the  principal  one  being  : 

CH2.N(C6H5).CH2 

I  I 

CH2.N(C6H5).CH2 

diethylene-diphenyt-diamine,  melting  at  157°. 

968.  Diphenylamine,    N(C6H5)2H,    obtained    according    to    the 

equation  : 

N(C6H5)H3C1  +  N(C6H6)Ha  =  NH4C1  +  N(C6H,)2H, 

forms  colourless  crystals  melting  at  54°,  distilling  undecomposed 
at  310°.     Its  salts  are  decomposed  by  water. 

Triphenylamme,     N(CgH5)3,    is    obtained,    together    with    the 


572  PHENYL  COMPOUNDS. 

previous  body,  by  heating  potassium  aniline  with  phenyl  bromide. 
It  melts  at  127°,  crystallises  in  tables  and  pyramids,  and  distils  above 
300° ;  is  very  insoluble  in  most  menstrua,  and  does  not  form  salts. 

969.  Anilides. — This  term  has  been  given  to  aniline  derivatives 
in  which  amidic  hydrogen  «is  removed  or  replaced  by  acid  or  negative 
radicals.  A  great  number  of  these  bodies  are  known,  including  com- 
pounds of  all  possible  acid  groups.  As  they  correspond  in  their 
methods  of  formation  and  chemical  characters  with  the  alkyl  amides 
of  the  acid  radicals  (§  636,  &c),  a  few  only  need  be  treated  of  in  this 
place. 

Formanilide,  N(C6H5)(CHO)H,  is  obtained  by  double  decomposi- 
tion between  ethers  of  formic  acid  and  aniline,  and  by  rapidly  heating 
equal  molecules  of  aniline  and  oxalic  acid  : 

HO.CO.CO.OH  +  N(C6H5)H2  =  C02  +  OH2  +  HCO.N(C6H5)H. 
It  forms  colourless  needles,  melting  at  46°  and  largely  soluble  in 
alcohol  and  water.  The  aqueous  solution  gives  a  precipitate  of 
sodium  formanilide,  HCO.N(C6H5)Na,  on  addition  of  strong  soda 
solution.  It  is  decomposed  by  water  alone,  and  by  boiling  with  it  is 
converted  into  sodic  formate  and  aniline. 

Acetanilide,  N(C6H5)(C2H50)H,  is  prepared  from  acetic  anhy- 
dride and  aniline,  or  by  heating  aniline  acetate  when  water  is  split  off. 
It  crystallises  in  shining  leaves,  melting  at  112°  and  distilling  un- 
changed at  295°.  It  is  also  soluble  in  water,  alcohol,  and  ether,  and 
is  saponified  by  alkaline  solutions,  yielding  aniline  and  salts  of 
acetic  acid. 

CO.N(C6H5)H 
Oxanilide,    |  ,  is  obtained  by  heating  aniline  oxalate 

CO.N(C6H5)H 
to  160°-180°.     It  forms  shining  leafy  crystals,  of  melting  point  245°, 
which  sublime  above  300°.     It  does  not  dissolve  in  water  and  ether, 
and  only  with  difficulty  in  alcohol. 

Acid    aniline    oxalate   heated   to   the   same    temperature    gives 

CO.N(C6H5)H 
oxanilic  acid,  phenyl  oxamic  acid,    |  ,  which  dissolves  in 

CO.OH 
water  and  crystallises   in   strongly   acid  scales.     It  decomposes  on 
heating,  yielding  formanilide  and  carbonic  acid. 
CH2.CO. 
Phenyl  succinimide,  N.C6H5,   is    obtained    as   a  final 

CH2.CO. 
product  when  acid  aniline  succinate  is  distilled  (§  837).     It  forms 
needles  melting  at  155°. 

Citric  acid  heated  with  aniline  gives  citranilide  : 

C3H4(OH)[CO.N(C6H5)H]3  ; 

citrobianil,  C3H4(OH)<  CO.        6     5       ;  and  citranilic  acid :

the  latter  body  being  formed  at  a  temperature  of  140°. 


CARBANILIDE.  573 

970.  Carbanilides. — Ethylic  chloro-carbonates  react  energetically 
with  aniline,  forming  ethylic  phenyl  carbamate,  phenyl  urethane  : 

C0.N(C6H5)H 
OU.O.C2H5 

and  hydrochloric  acid.  The  compound  forms  colourless  needles  of 
melting  point  52°,  which  boil  at  238°.  On  distilling  with  phos- 
phoric anhydride  the  ethyl  group  is  split  off,  and  phenylic  pseudo- 
cyanate,  carboxyl  phenylamide,  CO  :  N'.CgHs,  is  produced  as  a  colour- 
less liquid  boiling  at  163°,  which  combines  directly  with  ammonia  to 

form  phenyl  urea,  CO'^Ax6     b' 

The  same  body  also  results  from  the  double  decomposition  between 
aniline  sulphate  and  potassic  pseudo-cyanate  (§  282),  and  by  the  con- 
tinued action  of  cyanic  acid  vapour  on  aniline.  It  forms  colourless 
needles,  difficultly  soluble  in  cold  water  and  decomposing  on  heating 
into  cyanic  acid,  ammonia,  and  diphenyl  urea. 

Diphenyl  urea,  carbanilide,  CO(NC6H5H)2,  is  prepared  by  the 
decomposition  of  carboxyl  diphenylimide  by  water  (§  282),  by  direct 
combination  with  aniline  : 

CO  :  N.C6H5  +  N(C6H5)H2  =  CO  :  (NC6H5H)2, 

by  heating  1  part  urea  with  3  parts  aniline,  and  together  with  form- 
anilide  by  heating  oxanilide  at  a  high  temperature.  It  forms  silky 
needles  insoluble  in  water,  but  dissolving  in  alcohol  and  ethei,  melting 
at  205°,  and  volatilising  unchanged. 

971.  Thio-carl<i nilhhs. — On  warming  aniline  and  carbonic  sul- 
phide together,  hydric  sulphide  is  evolved  and  the  mass  solidifies  to 
crystals  of  diphenyl  sulphur ea  : 

CS2  +  2N(C6H5)H2  =  8H2  +  CSN(C6H5.H)2. 

This  reaction  takes  place  very  quickly  on  heating  equal  molecules 
of  aniline  and  potassic  hydrate  in  alcoholic  solution  with  excess  of 
carbonic  sulphide.  After  acidifying  and  evaporating  the  alcoholic 
filtrate  the  sulpho-carbanilide  crystallises  out  in  colourless  plates, 
melting  at  145°  and  dissolving  in  alcohol  and  ether. 

Phenyl  isosulphocyanate,  CS  :  N.C6H5,  is  obtained  from  diphenyl 
sulphurea  by  distilling  with  phosphoric  anhydride,  by  boiling  with 
hydrochloric  acid  : 

CS[N(C6H5)H]2  +  HC1  =  N(C6H5)H3C1  +  CS  :N.C6H5, 

or  by  the  action  of  alcoholic  iodine  solution,  as  a  colourless  oil  of 
similar  odour  to  the  alkyl  isosulpho-cyanates.  It  boils  at  222°  and 
combines  again  with  aniline  or  with  ammonia,  in  the  latter  case 

giving  phenyl  sulphurea,   CS'-^-Yt6     b' 

It  combines  with  alcohol  at  110°,  giving  phenyl  xanthogenamide, 

CS'^  V,  6tt         >  which  forms  crystals  melting  at  65°. 

972.  Phenyl   C 'yanamides. —By    passing    dry   gaseous    cyanogen

574  PHENYL   COMPOUNDS. 

solution  in  colourless  concentrically  grouped  needles,  difficultly  soluble 
in  water  and  melting  at  36°  -37°.  An  alcoholic  solution  of  phenyl 
sulphurea  gives  the  same  body  on  heating  with  plumbic  oxide. 

It  polymerises  at  ordinary  temperatures  to  triphenyl  melamine, 
C3N3(]S'C6H5N)3,  forming  prismatic  crystals  melting  at  162°. 

Diphenyl  cyanamide,  N  ■  C.N  :  (C6H5)2,  is  obtained  by  the  action 
of  diphenylamine  and  cyanogen  chloride  at  250°.  It  crystallises 
from  ligroine  or  coal-tar  naphtha  in  brilliant  rhombic  crystals,  melting 
at  292°.  This  is  in  all  probability  a  polymer  of  the  former  body 
=  hexaphenyl  melamine,  C3N3[N(C6H5)2]3.  It  yields  diphenyl- 
amine as  one  of  its  decomposition  products  when  heated  with  con- 
centrated hydric  chloride. 

Carbo-diphenylimide,  C(N.C6H-)2,  results  from  the  action  of 
mercuric  oxide  on  a  boiling  solution  of  diphenyl  sulphurea  in 
benzene  : 

CS(NC6H5H)2  +  HgO  =  HgS  +  OH2  +  C(N.C6H5)2. 

On  evaporating  the  filtered  solution  carbo-diphcnylamide  remains  as  a 
syrup  which  graduallv  crystallises  and  polymerises,  and  then  fuses 
between  168°  and  170°. 

A  solution  of  carbo-diphenylimide  in  benzene  gives,  on  saturation 
with  hydric  chloride,  a  brilliant  white  precipitate  of 

C(KC6H5).N(C6H5)HC1, 

which  is  decomposed  on  boiling  with  water  into  carbonic  acid  and 
aniline  hydrochloride. 

Carbo-diphenylimide  combines  with  water  to  form  diphenyl  urea, 
with  hydric  sulphide  forming  diphenyl  sulphurea,  with  ammonia  and 
amines  to  form  guanidine  derivatives,  and  with  carbonic  sulphide  at 
150°  to  form  phenyl  isosulpho-cyanate. 

973.  Phenyl  guanidines  may  be  obtained  from  the  above- 
mentioned  bodies  in  many  wavs. 

•NH 

Diplienyl  guanidine,  V./^rri  it  tt\  >    is  formed  from    diphenyl

and  by  the  direct  combination  of  ammonia  with  carbo-diphenylimide. 

It  crystallises  in  flattened  needles,  melting  at  147°,  and  gives  salts 

with  one  equivalent  of  acid,  e.g.  C13H13N3HC1. 

•N  C  H 
Triphenyl  guanidine,  C19HI7N3  =  C   \-    ';  n'    „«.   ,  can  also   be

2CS(N.C6H5H)2  =  H2S  +  CS  :N.C6H,  +  CN3.(C6H5)3H2; 
by  desulphurising  diphenyl  sulphurea  in  the  presence  of  aniline : 
CS(NC6H5H)2  +  NC6H5H2  +  HgO  =  HgS  +  OH2 
+  CN3(C6H5)3H2 ; 
and  by  direct  combination  of  carbo-diphenylimide  with  aniline  <vc. 


PHENYL  GUANIDINES.  575 

It  is  almost  insoluble  in  water,  separates  from  alcohol  in  shining 
rhombic  prisms,  m.p.  143°.     It  combines  with  one  equivalent  of  acids 
to  form  salts.     The  hydrochloride  has  the  formula  : 
C19H17N3.HC1  +  OH2. 

By  dry  distillation  it  splits  up  into  aniline  and  carbo-diphenyl- 
imide.

is  a  liquid  of  most  nauseous  odour,  which  cannot  be  distilled  unchanged, 
and  is  decomposed  by  aqueous  and  mineral  acids  into  aniline  salts  and 
formic  acid.  With  metallic  cyanides  it  combines  to  form  crystalline

975.  By  the  action  of  sodium  amalgam  on  an  alcoholic  solution 
of  nitro-benzene  which  is  maintained  slightly  acid  with  acetic  acid 
a  reduction  of  the  nitro-group  takes  place,  the  nitrogen  atoms  uniting 
together  and  so  yielding  azo-benzene  and  azoxy-benzene.  Similar 
products  are  obtained  on  treating  the  alcoholic  solution  with  strong 
potash,  in  which  case  some  of  the  alcohol  is  oxidised  to  acetic  acid. 
Azo  compounds  are  intermediate  reduction  products  between  nitro- 
benzene and  aniline. 

CGH5.N 
Azoxy-benzene,  C12H10N2O  =  X),    results    according   to 

c6h6.n/ 

the  equation : 

2C6H5.N02  +  6H  =  3H20  +  C12Hl0N2O. 
It  crystallises  in  long  yellow  needles,  insoluble  in  water,  but  easily  in 
alcohol  and  ether,  and  melting  at  36°. 

C6H5.N 
It  is  converted  by  nascent  hydrogen  into  azo-benzene,  ||  . 

C6H5'N 

This  is  best  obtained  by  distillation  of  a  mixture  of  equal  parts  nitro- 
benzene and  potassic  hydrate  in  alcoholic  solution.  The  final  distillate 
is  a  red  oil,  which  soon  crystallises.  It  may  be  obtained  pure  by  re- 
crystallising  from  alcohol  or  ether,  and  then  forms  garnet  red  plates 
or  tables,  very  much  like  potassic  bichromate.  It  melts  at  66°, 
distils  unchanged  at  293°,  and  is  insoluble  in  water. 

Azo-benzene  may  be  also  obtained  by  oxidation  of  aniline  by 
potassic  permanganate. 

Nascent  hydrogen  from  almost  any  source  converts  azo-benzene  into 

C6H5NH 
Hydr  azo-benzene,  ,  which  crystallises  in  colourless  tabu- 

C6H5NH 
lar  crystals,  melting  at  131°.     Oxidation  converts  it  into  azo-benzene; 
by  distillation  it  splits  up  into  aniline  and  azo-benzene,  and  in  contact 
with  strong  mineral  acids  it  yields  salts  of  its  isomer,  benzidine :

Diazo  Compounds. 

976.  Aniline  salts  are  reduced  by  the  action  of  nitrous  acid  into 
salts  of  diazo-benzene : 

C6H5.NH3.0.]Sr02  +  NO.OH  =  20H2  +  C6H5.N(N)O.N02. 

These  are  very  unstable  bodies,  which  explode  very  readily  on 
heating  or  percussion.  On  warming  with  water  they  decompose  into 
nitrogen,  free  acid,  and  phenol : 

C6H5.N(N).O.N02  +  OH2  =  N2  +  HN03  +  C6H5.OH. 


DIAZO-BENZENE  COMPOUNDS.  577 

By  boiling  with  absolute  alcohol  benzene  and  aldehyde  are  formed  : 
C6H5.Na :  O.S02.OH  +  C2H5.OH  =  N2  +  C6H6 
+  S02(HO)2  +  C2H40. 
With  the  haloid  acids  phenyl  haloid  compounds  are  formed  : 
C6H5.lSr2.O.N02  +  HI  =  N2  +  N02HO  +  C6H5I. 

977.  Diazo-henzene  nitrate,  C6H5.N2.O.N02,  is  obtained  by  the 
fiction  of  nitrous  anhydride  on  aniline  nitrate  mixed  with  a  small 
amount  of  water.  The  gas  should  be  passed  into  the  solution  until 
potassic  hydrate  ceases  to  produce  a  precipitate  of  aniline  in  it.  The 
salt  may  then  be  thrown  down  by  the  addition  of  alcohol  in 
colourless  needles  which  are  insoluble  in  ether  and  benzene. 

Diazo-benzene  sulphate,  C6H5.N2.O.S02.OH,  may  be  prepared  in 
a  similar  manner  to  the  nitrate,  and  also  crystallises  in  colourless 
prisms. 

The  aqueous  HC1  solution  of  both  salts  yields  with  platinic  chloride 
diazo-benzene-platino-chloride,  (C6H5.(N)2Cl)2PtCl4,  crystallising  in 
yellow  prisms,  which  by  distillation  with  potassic  hydrate  solution 
give  monochlor-benzene.  When  heated  alone  it  explodes  somewhat 
violently. 

Diazo-benzene  nitrate,  when  treated  with  hydric  bromide  con- 
taining bromine,  precipitates  diazo-benzene  tribromide,  C6H5N203, 
forming  large  yellow  plates  insoluble  in  water  and  ether,  difficultly 
soluble  in  alcohol. 

Diazo-benzene  salts,  when  treated  with  concentrated  potash  solu- 
tion, form  a  potassium  compound,  C6H5.N2.OK,  which  may  be 
obtained  pure  by  crystallisation  from  alcohol,  when  it  forms  colourless 
pearly  prisms,  which  are  highly  explosive  and  are  insoluble  in  ether. 
The  fresh  aqueous  solution  gives  a  precipitate  with  argentic 
nitrate  of  C6H,vN2.O.Ag ;  with  acetic  acid  a  yellow  aromatic  oil, 
probably  diazobenzene  hydrate,  C6H5.lSr2.OH.  It  soon  decomposes 
into  nitrogen  and  phenol, 

978.  jDiozo-amido-benzene,  C6H5N2.NH.C6H5,  is  obtained  by 
passing  N203  into  a  cold  alcoholic  solution  of  aniline  : 

C6H5.NH2  +  N203  =  3H20  +  C6H5.N2.NH.C6H5 ; 
also  by  mixing  aqueous  solutions  of  diazo-benzene  salts  with  aniline  : 
C6H5.N2.O.N02  +  2N(C6H5)H2  =  N.(C6H5)H3.O.N02 
+  C6H,N,NH.C6H5. 
It   separates  in   golden  yellow   needles,  insoluble  in  water  and 
difficultly  so  in  cold  alcohol,  melting  at  91°  and  decomposing  with 
slight  explosion  at  a  higher  temperature. 

It  is  split  up  by  strong  hydrochloric   acid  into  aniline  hydro- 
chloride, nitrogen,  and  phenol. 
Metadiamido-azobenzene : 

C12H12N4  =  C6H5-N=N-C6H3(NH2)2 
(1  :  2  :  4),  is  prepared  by  the  action  of  metadiamido-benzene  on  diazo- 
amido-benzene,  or    by  the  action  of  metadiamido-benzene  and  azo- 
benzene  hydrochloride : 

C6H4(NH2)2  +  C6H5  -  N  =  N  -  d 

=  C3H5  -  N=N  -  C6H3(NH2)2  +  HC1.

It  forms  slender  yellow  needles,  sparingly  soluble  in  water,  readily  in 
alcohol  and  ether;  it  melts  at  117'5°.  It  is  used  as  a  yellow  dye 
under  the  name  of  chrysoidine. 

Triamido-azobenzene,  Bismarck  brown  : 

N.C6H3(NH2)2

N.C6H4.NH2

N.C6H4.NH2 
It  is  extensively  used  as  a  brown  dye. 

Diazo-benzene  amide,  C6H5N3,  is  formed  by  the  action  of  diazo- 
benzene  tribromide  on  aqueous  ammonia  :

HI         +  NH3  +  3NH3  =  3NH4Br  +  1 1 1  >T

It  Ls  a  yellowish  oil,  which  can  be  distilled  with  steam,  but 
explodes  when  heated  alone.  Nascent  hydrogen  converts  it  into 
aniline  and  ammonia  : 

C6H5N3  +  8H  =  2NH3  +  06H5.NH2. 

Aromatic  Hydrazines. 

978«.  The  hydrazine  compounds  of  the  aromatic  series  may  be 
obtained  from  the  more  stable  diazo-benzene  compounds  by  the  action 
of  sulphurous  acid  or  sulphites,  or  by  the  reduction  of  diazo-amido- 
aromatic  compounds  by  means  of  zinc  dust  and  acetic  acid. 

A  somewhat  numerous  series  of  both  primary  and  secondary 
hydrazines  (§  275a)  have  in  this  way  been  obtained. 

Primary  Hydrazines. 

9786.  Phenylhydrazine,  06H5.NH  —  NH2,  results  from  the  re- 
duction of  potassic  diazo-benzene  sulphonate  with  sulphurous  acid. 

The  ordinary  salts  of  diazo-benzene  are  not  suitable  for  this  re- 
action on  account  of  their  instability. 

The  following  is  a  good  method  of  preparation  : — 20  parts  of  aniline 
is  dissolved  in  50  parts  of  strong  hydrochloric  acid  solution,  to  which 
the  calculated  amount  of  sodic  nitrate  in  solution  is  added,  whereby 
it  is  converted  into  diazo-benzene  chloride ;  to  this  there  is  added, 
with  continuous  stirring,  an  excess  of  a  very  well  cooled  solution  of 
sodic  sulphite,  and  the  precipitated  salt  of  the  diazo-sulphonic  acid 
dissolved  by  gently  warming  and  carefully  neutralised  with  hydro- 
chloric acid.  The  sulphurous  anhydride  evolved  reduces  most  of  the 
diazo-salt  to  the  salt  of  phenylhydrazine-sulphonic  acid,  the  reduction 
being  completed  by  the  addition  of  a  little  zinc  dust  and  acetic  acid. 
The  sodic  salt  of  phenylhydrazine-sulphonic  acid  separates  for  the 
most  part  on  cooling.  It  is  obtained  in  hot  concentrated  solution 
and  decomposed  with  one-third  of  its  volume  of  fuming  hydrochloric 
acid,  whereby  the  whole  solidifies  to  a  crystalline  mass  of  phenyl- 
hydrazine  chloride,  from  which  the  free  base  may  be  obtained,   on

addition  of  concentrated  sodic  hydrate,  as  an  oily  layer  which  may  be 
separated,  dried  with  potassic  carbonate,  and  distilled.  When  freshly 
distilled  it  is  a  colourless  oil  of  faintly  aromatic  odour,  which  solidifies 
in  a  cooling  mixture  to  tabular  crystals,  melting  at  23°.  It  boils 
between  233°  and  234°  at  750  mm.  B.,  and  is  volatile  in  steam.  Its 
sp.  gr.  =  1-091  at  21°.  Tt  is  difficultly  soluble  in  cold,  somewhat 
easily  so  in  hot  water,  and  dissolves  easily  in  most  other  solvents. 

It  is  very  easily  oxidised,  and  gives  a  most  characteristic  reaction 
with  alkaline  copper  solutions,  the  reduction  to  cuprous  oxide  taking 
place  in  the  cold.  The  reaction  serves  as  a  test  for  hydrazines,  and 
also  for  diazo  compounds.  The  oxidation  products  in  this  case  are 
nitrogen,  benzene,  and  aniline.  When  HgO  is  used  some  mercury 
diphenyl  is  also  produced. 

Oxidising  agents,  haloid  alkyl  compounds,  acid  chlorides,  alde- 
hydes, cyanogen,  carbonic  sulphide,  and  oxide  sulphur,  <fec,  all  act 
upon  or  form  combinations  with  phenylhydrazine.  It  is  a  monacid 
base  and  forms  mostly  crystalline  soluble  salts.  The  sulphate, 
(C6H5.N2H3)2H2S04,  forms  white  leafy  crystals,  insoluble  in  ether. 

Phenyl-nitroso-h  y<l  nr.ine,  C6H5.N.(NO).NH2,  prepared  from 
phenylhydrazine  hydrochloride  and  sodic  nitrite,  forms  yellowish 
crystals,  permanent  in  the  air,  but  decomposing  in  closed  vessels  to  a 
dark  brown  liquid  of  exceedingly  pungent  odour. 

M onacetyl-pht  >t//!//;/< Irazine,  C6HvN2H2.C2H30,  obtained  by  the 
action  of  acetic  anhydride  on  phenylliydrazine,  crystallises  from  hot 
water  in  fine  colourless  plates,  melting  at  128*5°  and  distilling 
almost  undecomposed. 

Phenyl  carbazinic  acid  is  not  known  in  the  free  state,  but  the 
phenylhydrazine  salt,  (C6H5N2H3)HO.CO.N2H2C6H5,  is  formed  by 
the  direct  combination  of  carbonic  anhydride  with  the  base.  It  is  a 
brilliant,  soft,  white  body,  almost  insoluble  in  water  and  ether. 

The  analogous  sulphur  compound,  phenylhydrazine  phenyl  sulpho- 
earbazinate,  (C6H5.N2H3)HS.CS.N2H2.C6Hr),  crystallises  from  ether 
in  hexagonal  tables,  melting  at  96°. 

Phenyl  sulpho-carbazinic  acid,  C6H5.N2H2.CS.SH,  easily  decom- 
poses either  in  solution  in  water  or  on  warming  (comp.  sulphureas). 

Monobenzoyl-phenylhydrazine,  C6H5.N2H2.C7H50,  is  formed  by 
heating  phenylhydrazine  with  benzoyl  chloride.  It  melts  at  168°  and 
dissolves  in  hot  alcohol,  acetone,  chloroform,  and  in  potassic  hydrate 
solution. 

Diphenyl  oxazide,  (C6K5.N2H2)2C202,  is  obtained  when  ethylic 
oxalate  and  phenylhydrazine  are  heated  together.  It  is  crystalline 
and  melts  at  about  260°. 

Benzylidene  phenylhydrazine,  C6H5.N2H.CII.C6H5,  is  prepared 
from  benzoic  aldehyde,  and  the  base  crystallises  from  dilute  alcohol 
in  monoclinic  crystals,  melting  at  152-5°. 

Ethylidene  phenylhydrazine,  C6H5 — N2H.CH.CH3,  formed  from 
ethyl  aldehyde  in  a  similar  manner  to  the  above,  is  a  crystalline  body 
which  decomposes  in  contact  with  water. 

Secondary  Hydrazines. 

978c.  Diphenylhydrazine,  (C6H5)2N — NH2,  is  metameric  with 
hydrazo-benzene,  which  may  be  considered  as  a  symmetrical  phenyl

derivative  of  hydrazine,  C6H5.HN— NH.CGH5.  It  is  obtained  by 
the  reduction  of  phenyl  nitrosamine  with  zinc  dust  and  acetic  acid  in 
well-cooled  alcoholic  solutions.  It  is  an  oil  which  does  not  solidify 
at  —17°,  and  distils  with  partial  decomposition  into  ammonia,  di- 
phenylamine,  and  tarry  bodies.  It  is  a  monacid  base,  but  its  salts 
are  very  unstable,  being  partially  decomposed  by  water. 

Monobenzoyl  diphenylhydrazine,  (C6H5)2]Sr2H(OO.C6H5),  crys- 
tallises from  acetone  in  fine  white  shining  needles,  melting  at  192°. 
It  is  obtained  by  the  action  of  benzoyl  chloride  on  diphenylhydrazine 
in  ethereal  solution. 

Benzylidene  diphenylhydrazine,  (C6H5)2N2.(CH.C6H5),  prepared 
from  benzoic  aldehyde  and  diphenylhydrazine,  may  be  obtained  from 
hot  alcohol  in  yellow  crystals,  melting  at  122°. 

Tetraphenyl-tetrazon,  (C6H5)2  :  N4  :  (C6H5)2,  obtained  from  the 
action  of  weak  oxidising  agents  on  diphenylhydrazine  in  the  cold, 
forms  colourless  crystals,  melting  at  123°,  soluble  in  ether,  alcohol, 
petroleum,  chloroform,  Arc. 

When  ferric  chloride  is  used  as  oxidising  agent,  nitrogen,  diphenyl- 
amine,  and  a  blue  colouring  matter  are  formed. 

Phospho  Derivatives. 

979.  When  a  mixture  of  the  vapours  of  benzene  and  phosphorus 
trichloride  is  repeatedly  passed  through  a  red-hot  tube, 

Phosphenyl  dichloride  is  obtained,  according  to  the  equation  : 

C6H6  +  PC13  =  HC1  +  C6H5.PC12, 

as  a  colourless  liquid  of  sp.  gr.  1*319  at  20°,  boiling  at  222°.  It 
refracts  light  strongly  and  fumes  in  the  air. 

It  combines  with  chlorine  to  form  phosphenyl  tetrachloride, 
(■,;H5.PC14,  a  crystalline  solid  melting  at  73°  ;  and  with  bromine  to 
form  phosphenyl  dichlor-dibromide,  C6H5.PCl2Br2.  With  oxygen  it 
forms  phosphenyl  oxydichloride,  C6H5.P0C12,  a  liquid  boiling  with 
partial  decomposition  at  260°. 

Phosphenyl  dichloride  reacts  with  water,  forming  phosphenylic 
acid,  C6H5P(OH)2  or  C6H5.PHO.OH,  which  separates  from  hot 
saturated  solutions  as  a  limpid  oil,  solidifying  on  cooling  to  leafy 
crystals.  Its  salts  have  the  formula  CGH5PHM02.  With  phosphorus 
pentachloride  it  gives  phosphorus  trichloride,  phospho-oxy chloride, 
and  phosphenyl  oxydichloride  : 

C6H5.PH202  +  2PC15  =  PCI3  +  POCI3  +  2HC1  +  C6H5.P0C12. 

The  three  saturated  phosphenyl  haloid  compounds  are  decomposed 
by  water  into  hydric  haloid  and  the  very  stable  dibasic 

Phenyl  phosphonic  acid,  C6H5.PO(OH)2  (comp.  §  304),  which 
dissolves  in  water  and  alcohol  and  crystallises  in  plates  melting  at 
158°.     It  decomposes  at  250°  into  benzene  and  metaphosphoric  acid  : 

C6H5.PO(OH)2  =  C6H6  +  P02OH. 

On  saturating  phosphenyl  dichloride  with  HI,  a  solid  mass  is 
formed,  probably  (CGH5PI2.HI),  hydric  chloride  being  expelled.  It 
decomposes  with  alcohol  to  phenyl  phosphine,  C6H5.PH2,  a  most 
repulsive-smelling   oil,    which    sinks    in   water    and    boils   at    160°. 


MERCURY  DIPHENYL.  581 

Aqueous  acids  do  not  combine  with  it,  but  with  hydriodic  acid  gas 
it  forms  phenyl  phosphonium  iodide,  PH3.CGH5.I,  a  solid,  which 
reacts  with  water,  forming  phenyl  phosphine  and  hydric  iodide. 

On  exposure  to  air  phenyl  phosphine  oxidises  to  phenyl  phosphine 
,  C6H.,.PH20,  a  crystalline  solid  easily  soluble  in  water. 

Phenyl  phosphine  combines  with  sulphur,  yielding  a  crystalline 
body,  melting  at  138°,  and  possibly  having  the  constitution

soluble  in  benzene.  It  probably  corresponds  in  constitution  to  azo- 
benzene. 

Phenyl  Mercury  Compounds. 

980.  Mercury  di phenyl,  C6H5.Hg.C6H„  is  easily  obtained  on 
heating  brom-benzene,  diluted  with  benzene,  with  sodium  amalgam,  a 
small  quantity  of  ethylic  acetate  being  added  to  the  mixture  in  order 
to  start  the  reaction.  It  forms  rhombic  crystals,  becoming  yellow  on 
exposure  to  light,  melts  at  120°,  and  sublimes  mostly  unchanged,  a 
small  amount,  however,  being  decomposed  into  mercury,  diphenyl- 
benzene,  and  carbon.  It  is  insoluble  in  water  and  only  slightly 
soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether  ;  benzene  dissolves  it  easily. 

Free  halogens  act  upon  it  according  to  the  equations  : 

Hg:(C6H5)2  +  2C12  =  2CVH,<1  +  HgCla 
and 

Hg(C6H5)2  +  Cl2  =  C6H6C1  +  Cl.Hg.CVJI-,. 

Haloid  phenyl  mercury  compounds  are  also  formed  when  mercury 
di phenyl  is  heated  with  haloid  mercury  salts  and  alcohol : 

C6H5.Hg.C6H5  +  Hgl2  =  2(C6H5.Hg.I). 

They  all  crystallise  in  rhombic  tables  and  melt  at  something  above 
250°.  When  heated  with  moist  argentic  oxide  the  halogen  atom  is 
removed,  mercury  phenyl  hydrate  being  produced. 

It  is  a  powerful  base,  which  crystallises  in  prisms  and  gives  salts 
with  acids. 

Tin  Phenyl  Compounds. 

980a.  Mercury  diphenyl,  when  heated  with  stannic  chloride  in 
solution  in  naphtha,  gives  stan-diphenyl  dichloride  : 

SnCl4  +  2(C6H5)2Hg  =  2Hg(C6H5)Cl  +  SnCl2.(C6H5)2. 

Stan-diphenyl  dichloride  forms  beautiful  colourless  triclinio 
crystals,  melting  at  42°,  soluble  in  alcohol,  and  decomposing  on 
boiling  with  water  to  stan-phenoxy chloride,  Sn(C6H5)C1.0H,  an 
insoluble  powder  melting  at  187°.  It  yields  stannic  chloride  and 
benzene  on  boiling  with  concentrated  hydric  chloride.

Ar8en-phenyl  Compounds. 

9806.  Phenylrarsen-chloride,  AsCl2C6H5,  obtained  by  heating 
arsenious  chloride  and  mercury  diphenyl,  is  a  colourless  liquid  boiling 
at  252°-255°,  decomposed  by  water  with  great  difficulty,  but  easily 
by  alkalies.  A  potassic  compound,  C6H5As(OK)2,  is  soluble  in 
alcohol.  It  combines  directly  with  chlorine,  forming  phenyl  arsen- 
tetrachloride,  C6H5AsCl4,  a  yellow  liquid  which  reacts  violently  with 
water,  yielding  monophenyl-ar sonic  acid,  C6H5.AsO.(OH)2,  white 
needles  melting  at  168°. 

Diphenyl-arsen-cJdoride,  (C6H5)2AsCl,  is  an  oily  liquid. 

Diphenyl-arsen-trichloride,  (C6H5)2AsCl3,  is  a  solid  which  decom- 
poses with  water,  yielding 

Diphenyl-ar -sonic  acid,  (C6H5)2AsO.(OH),  which  crystallises  in 
fine  needles,  melting  at  174°  and  easily  soluble  in  hot  water. 

Phenyl-ar sen-oxide,  C6H5AsO,  has  an  odour  like  anise ;  it  is 
insoluble  in  water  and  melts  at  119°-120°. 

It  gives  triphenyl-arsine,  (C6H5)3As,  on  heating  above  its  melting 
point. 

Phenyl-ar sen-oxy chloride,  C6H5AsOCl2,  prepared  from  the  tetra- 
chloride by  the  action  of  water,  is  solid,  melts  about  100°,  and  dis- 
solves easily  in  water. 

Benzene  Disubstitution  Products,  Phenylene  Compounds. 

981.  A  very  large  number  of  disubstituted  benzene  compounds 
is  known.  The  number  of  known  isomers  in  any  case  amounts  at 
most  to  three.  Dihaloid  benzenes  can  be  prepared  by  the  direct 
action  of  the  halogen  with  the  aid  of  heat.  The  product  is  generally 
a  mixture  of  two  isomers,  of  which  one  is  solid  and  usually  exceeds 
the  other  in  amount. 

The  crystalline  isomer  may  be  considered  to  belong  to  the  para 
series,  as  it  can  be  converted  into  terephthalic  acid,  according  to  the 
equation  : 

C6H4Br2  +  2CieO.OX\,H-,  +  2Na2  =  2NaCl 
+  2NaBr  +  C6H4(CO.O.C2H5)2, 

and  further  yields  only  a  single  tri-derivative  (comp.  §  954). 

In  the  case  of  the  dibrom-benzenes  another  isomer  has  been  con- 
verted in  a  similar  manner  into  isophthalic  acid,  and  also  has  been  shown 
to  yield  three  tribrom -benzenes  on  further  bromination,  thus  proving 
it  to  be  the  meta  derivative,  so  that  the  ortho  position  alone  remains 
for  the  third  dibrom-benzene. 

In  cases  where  different  radicals  are  substituted — for  instance,  nitro- 
haloid  benzenes,  obtained  by  nitrating  haloid  benzenes — two  isomers 
result,  of  which  one  appears  to  be  the  ortho,  the  other  the  para 
compound.  This  is  also  the  case  with  the  haloid  and  nitro  products 
of  phenol  and  the  phenol  sulphonic  acids.

chloride  on  ortho-chlor  phenol,  and  by  the    direct    chlorination   of 
ne ;  it  is  a  liquid  boiling  at  179°  and  of  sp.  gr.  1"3278  at  0°. 
M,tn,lirlilor-benzene  is  obtained  from    metachlor-aniline,  by  con- 
ion  of  this  latter,  by  treatment  with  nitrous  acid,  into  diazochlor- 
benzene,    the   platinochloride    of  which,    on   distillation   with    sodic 
carbonate,  yields  metadichlor-benzene  as  a  colourless  oil,  boiling  at 
170°-172°.     It  is  also  obtained  by  the  action  of  phosphoric  chloride 
on  metachlor-phenol. 

Paradia Wor-benzene  is  prepared  by  the  direct  chlorination  of 
benzene  in  the  presence  of  iodine,  and  is  separated  from  the  other 
products  by  fractional  distillation ;  it  is  also  prepared  by  the  action  of 
phosphoric  chloride  on  parachlor-phenol.  It  crystallises  in  mono- 
clinic  prisms,  melts  at  54°,  and  boils  at  173°-174°. 

Dibrom-benzenes,  C6H4Br2.  Orthodibrom-benzene  appears  to  be 
formed  in  small  quantity  by  the  action  of  bromine  on  benzene,  but 
has  not  yet  been  obtained  in  a  state  of  purity  from  that  source.  It 
can  be  prepared  by  the  action  of  phosphoric  bromide  on  orthobrom- 
phenol  and  hydro-quinone,  or  from  orthobroin -aniline,  which  is  first 
converted  into  the  nitrate,  then  treated  with  nitrous  acid,  whereby 
orthobroin -diazo- benzene  is  formed  : 

CGH4Br.NH3.O.N02  +  NOHO  =  C6H4Br.N2.ON02. 
This  is  then  converted  into  perbromide  by  treatment  with  bromine 
water,  and  the  pure  diazobrom-benzene  perbromide  distilled  with  sodic 
carbonate,  when  orthodibroni-benzene  distils. 

It  crystallises  at  -  6°,  melts  at  -  1°,  boils  at  223°-224°,  and  has 
sp.  gr.  2*003  at  0°.  On  nitration  it  yields  two  nitro-orthodibrom- 
benzenes,  of  which  the  principal  (NO.,  :  Br  :  Br  =  1  :  3  :  4)  melts  at 
58-6°. 

MetadiJbrom-benzene  is  obtained  from  metabrom-aniline  by  the 
'  diazo  reaction '  described  above ;  it  is  also  obtained  from  the  dibrom- 
anilinc  prepared  by  direct  bromination  of  acetanilide  and  distillation 
with  potassic  hydrate,  by  dissolving  it  in  alcohol  saturated  with 
nitric  acid  ;  dibrom-diazo-benzene  is  first  formed,  but  this  reacts  with 
the  alcohol,  forming  nitrogen,  aldehyde,  and  dibrom-benzene  (comp. 
§  976). 

Metadibrom-benzene  can  also  be  obtained  by  the  action  of  phos- 
phoric bromide  on  metabrom-phenol ;  it  is  still  liquid  at  —  20°,  boils 
at  219°,  and  has  sp.  gr.  1955  at  IS^0.  On  treatment  with  nitric  acid 
it  yields  two  nitro-metadibrom-benzenes.     One 

(N02:Br:Br  =  l:2:4) 

melts  at  61-6°,  the  other  (Br  :  ]ST02  :  Br  =  1  :  2  :  3)  melting  at  82-6°. 
A  third  (N02  :  Br  :  Br  =  1  :  3  : 5)  is  only  obtained  indirectly. 

Paradibrom-benzene  is  the  chief  ingredient  of  the  mixture  of 
dibrom-benzenes  obtained  by  direct  bromination  of  benzene,  and  is 
obtained  on  cooling  in  crystals ;  it  can  also  be  prepared  by  the  action 
of  phosphoric  bromide  on  parabrom-phenol,  and  from  parabrom- 
aniline  by  the  '  diazo  reaction.'  It  crystallises  in  monoclinic  prisms, 
melts  at  89°,  and  boils  at  218*6°;  on  treatment  with  nitric  acid  it 
yields  only  a  single  nitro-paradibrom-benzene  : 

(Br  :  N02  :  Br  =  1  :  2  :  4), 
melting  at  85 '4°.

dinitro-benzenes  is  readily  obtained  by  slowly  adding  benzene  to  a 
mixture  of  one  volume  of  fuming  nitric  acid  and  two  volumes  of 
sulpliuric  acid  ;  it  is  then  precipitated  by  addition  of  water  and  crys- 
tallised from  alcohol.     The  product  so  obtained  consists   mainly  of 

linitroltonasme,  and  can  be  obtained  in  a  state  of  purity  by 
several  recrystallisations  from  hot  alcohol.  It  then  forms  thin  flexible 
needles  and  melts  at  89'9°.  The  mother  liquors  still  contain  two 
other  dinitro-benzenes,  which  maybe  separated  from  each  other  by 
repeal  Jlisation.

VnrnnitnnuUne. — Nitric  acid  acting  on  acetanilide  converts  it 
into  a  mixture  of  ortho-  and  para-nitracetanilides.  Alkalies  convert 
this  into  the  corresponding  nitranilines,  of  which  the  para  compound 

tly  preponderates  and  can  be  separated  by  crystallisation.  It 
can  also  be  obtained  by  the  reduction  of  paradinitro-benzene.  It

986.  Halogen  Amido-benzenet. — The  monochlor-  or  brom-deriva- 
tivee  cannot  be  obtained  by  the  action  of  chlorine  and  bromine  on 
aniline,  as  this  only  yields  the  tri-products.  Iodine,  however,  converts 
aniline  into  pariodaniline.

Sui  Phenols. 

988.  By  the  action  of  chlorine  on  phenol  two  isomeric  niono- 
chlor-phenols   are  obtained:    orthochior-phenolf    C,jH4C1.0H(l  :2),  a' 

colourless  oily  liquid,  boiling  at  176°-177°,  solidifying  at  —  12°,  and 
melting  at  —7°  ;  &n&pctr<»chlor-phenol,CsH.4i  '].OH(l  :  4),  a  crystalline 
body,  melting  at  41°  auTl  boiling  at  218°. 

Metachlor-phenol,  C6H4C1.0H(1 : 3),  prepared  from  metachlor-

Parabrom-phenol  forms  colourless  monoclinic  crystals,  melts  at 
66°,  and  boils  at  236°. 

Todo-phenols,  C6H4I.OH.  As  before  stated,  the  three  isomers  are 
formed  simultaneously. 

The  liquid  isomer,  and  that  one  of  the  solids  melting  at  64°-66°, 
are  volatile  in  a  current  of  steam.  The  third  non- volatile  solid  melts 
at  87°  and  is  somewhat  soluble  in  water.  Both  solid  isomers  may  be 
obtained  from  the  iodo-anilines  by  conversion  into  the  sulphate  of 
diazo-iodobenzene  and  decomposition  of  this  by  boiling  water. 

Though  the  constitution  of  these  bodies  is  still  uncertain,  yet  it  is 
probable  that  the  liquid  is  the  ortho  compound,  the  solid  melting  at 
89°  the  meta,  and  that  melting  at  64°-66°  the  para  derivative.

SUBSTITUTED  PHENOLS.  587 

989.  Nitro-phenola,  <  „H,(N02).OH.  Two  isomeric  nitro-phenols 
(ortho  and  para)  are  produced  by  the  action  of  dilute  nitric  acid  on 
phenol. 

They  may  be  separated  by  distillation  with  steam.  Oriho-ntiro- 
phenol  passes  over  and  crystallises  from  water  in  sulphur  yellow 
prism-,  melting  at  45°  and  boiling  at  214°.  Paranitro-phenol  forms 
white  prisms,  melting  at  114°. 

Metanitro-phenol  may  be  obtained  from  the  metanitraniline 
(melting  at  108°)  by  conversion  into  the  diazo-benzene  nitrate  and 
decomposition  of  this  salt  by  water.  It  forms  colourless  non- volatile 
prisms,  pretty  soluble  in  water  and  melting  at  96°.  It  may  also 
be  obtained  from  the  sulphonic  acid  of  nietadinitro-benzene,  melting 
at  90°. 

'fro- phenols. — Ortho-nitro-phenol  under  the  influence  of  nitric 
acid  is  converted  into  the  di nitro-phenols,  1:2:4  and  1:2:6. 

The  first  forms  yellowish  tabular  crystals,  melting  at  114°,  and  is 
also  obtained  from  paranitro-phenol  (m.p.  114°).  The  1:2:6  com- 
pound melts  at  64°. 

On  still  further  nitration  these  two  dinitro-phenols  yield  an 
identical  trinitro-phenol  or  picric  acid,  (,GH2(N02)3.0H,  1:2:4:6, 
m.p.  120°. 

M't'initro-phenol  gives  also  two  modifications  of  dinitro-phenol, 
y  and  c — one  melting  at  104°  =  y,  pretty  soluble  in  hot  water, 
easily  in  alcohol  and  ether;  the  other,  <\  tine  silky  needles,  melting 
1  H    and  separating  in  a  liquid  state  from  its  solutions. 

They  yield  an  isopioric  acid,  on  nitration,  melting  at  174°,  easily 
soluble  in  hot  water. 

Xitrost>-pln  ,<■>!.  C  11,0^0)011,  is  obtained  along  with  dimethyl- 
amine  by  boiling  oitroso-dimethy]  aniline  with  alkalies.  After  acidi- 
fying with  sulphuric  acid  it  may  be  extracted  with  ether,  from  which 
it  crystallises  in  yellow  prisms,  m.p.  120°-130°,  moderately  Boluble  in 
water.  It  may  also  be  obtained  by  direct  action  of  nitrous  acid  on 
phenol.  Nitric  acid  oxidises  it  to  paranitro-phenol,  m.p.  114°.  It 
forms  a  sodium  compound,  C6H4(NO).ONa,  with  sodic  hydrate  solu- 
tion, and  on  reduction  is  converted  into  paramido-phenol. 

Afnido-phenoUy  ( ,(JH4(NH2)OH,  result  from  the  reduction  of 
nitro-phenols  by  tin  and  hydrochloric  acid.  They  are  colourless 
crystalline  bodies,  difficultly  soluble  in  cold  water  and  giving  crystal- 
line salts  with  acids.  Ortho- and  para-nitro-phenol  yield  an  amido- 
phenol,  melting  at  170°.  From  paraortho-dinitro-phenol  and  trinitro- 
phenol  or  picric  acid  the  respective  diamido-phenols,  C6H3(NH2)2OH, 
and  triamido-phenol,  CGH2(NH2)3OH,  have  been  obtained. 

By  partial  reduction  the  dinitro-phenols  give  amido-nitro-phenols, 
of  which  the  following  are  the  examples  as  yet  known  : 

C6H3(N02)(NH2).OH 

from  1:2:4  dinitro-phenol,  and  C6H2(N02)2(NH2)OH  and 

C6H2(N02)(NH2)2OH 
from  picric  acid. 

Alkyl  nitrites  act  on  amido-nitro-phenols,  replacing  the  amido 
group   by  hydrogen,  paranitro-phenol   being  at  the  same   time  pro-

Sulphonic  Acids. 

990.  Halogen  Benzene-sulphonic  Acids.  —  Parachlor-benzene- 
sulphonic  acid,  C6H4C1.S02.0H,  is  obtained  by  the  action  of  Nord- 
hausen  sulphuric  acid  on  monochlor-benzene.  The  ortho  and  meta 
compounds  are  also  known.  All  three  varieties  of  the  brom-benzene- 
sulphonic  acids,  C6H4Br.S02.OH,  have  been  obtained,  similarly  to 
the  chlor  compounds.     Ortho-iodo-benzene-sulphonic  acid  : 

C6H4I.S02.OH, 

is  obtained  by  the  action  of  Nordhausen  sulphuric  acid  on  iodo- 
benzene. 

By  treatment  of  benzene-sulphonic  acid  with  nitric  acid,  or  of 
nitro-benzene  with  Nordhausen  sulphuric  acid,  the  three  isomeric 
nitro-benzene-sulphonic  acids  have  been  obtained,  the  meta  compound 
being  always  formed  in  largest  proportion.  Their  salts  exhibit  well- 
characterised  differences,  but  only  the  meta  acid,  which  crystallises  in 
large  deliquescent  plates,  has  yet  been  obtained  definitely  in  the  free 
state. 

The  corresponding  amido-benzene-sulphonic  acids  are  prepared  by 
reduction  of  the  nitro-acids.  Pcvrchamido-benzene-stdphonic  act'/  is 
also  obtained  by  the  action  of  sulphuric  acid  on  aniline,  and  is  there- 
fore termed  sulphanilic  acid  ;  it  crvstallises  in  large  rhombic  tables  of 
the  formula  C6H4(NH2).S02.OH,H20,  is  difficultly  soluble  in  cold 
water  (112  parts  at  15°),  readily  in  hot  water,  insoluble  in  alcohol 
and  ether. 

Meta-amido-benzene-sulphonic  acid  generally  crystallises  in  anhy- 
drous needles. 

Orthamido-benzene-suJ phonic  acid  generally  crystallises  in  rhombo- 
hedrons  of  the  formula  2C6H4(NH2).S02.OH,H20. 

Ortho-  and  meta-amido-benzene-sulphonic  acids  are  reduced  by 
nitrous  acid  to  the  corresponding  diazo-acids  : 

c6h4n2so3  =  c6h4;^2>o 

The  ortho  compound  forms  rhombic  plates  and  gives  off  nitrogen 
on  boiling  with  water. 

The  meta  acid  forms  small  reddish  yellow  prisms,  which  explode 
when  heated  and  are  decomposed  by  water  at  60°  with  evolution  of 
nitrogen. 

Phenol-sul phonic  acids,  C6H4(OH).S02OH.  Two  isomeric  acids 
of  this  formula  are  obtained  by  dissolving  phenol  in  sulphuric  acid. 
At  ordinary  temperatures  ortho-phenol-8iUpho7iic  add  is  obtained  in 
largest  quantity,  which  yields  readily  soluble  salts  ;  this  acid  on 
heating  is  converted  into  par -aphenol-svl phonic  acid,  whose  salts  are 
more  difficultly  soluble  and  therefore  crystallise  first  from  a  mixture 
of  both.  As  a  rule  the  potassic  salts  are  employed  for  separation,  the 
para  salt  crystallising  in  six-sided  tables,  C6H4(OH)S02.OK,  whilst 
later  the  more  readily  soluble  ortho  salt  separates  in  prisms  of  the 
formula  CGH4(OH)S02.OK,2H20. 


PYKOCATECHIN.      RESORCIN.  589 

Excess  of  sulphuric  acid  or  long  beating  must  be  avoided  in  the 
preparation  of  these  acids  ;  otherwise  phenol- disulphonic  acid  : 

C6H3(OH)(S02.OH)2, 

will  he  the  principal  product. 

Benzene-disulphonic  acids,  C6H4(S02.OH)2.  The  meta  and  para 
compounds  are  known,  and  are  both  obtained  by  the  action  of  sul- 
phuric acid  on  benzene-monosulphoiiic  acid  or  of  fuming  sulphuric 
acid  on  benzene,  the  product  mainly  consisting  of  the  former  if  the 
temperature  be  kept  low,  whilst  the  para  acid  predominates  at  higher 
temperatures  ;  the  acids  being  best  separated  by  means  of  the  different 
solubilities  of  their  potassic  salts,  the  para  salt  being  least  soluble. 

Diphenoh,   C6H4  :  (OH)2. 

991.  All  the  possible  isomeric  bodies  of  this  formula  are  known, 
and  the  relative  positions  of  the  hydroxyl  groups  have  been  settled 
with  comparative  certainty.

materials,  and  also  from  the  liquid  ortho-haloid-phenols  and  from 
ortho-phenol-sulphonic  acid  by  the  action  of  fused  potash.  Cellulose 
heated  with  water  for  a  long  time  to  200  is  also  said  to  yield  ortho- 
dioxy-benzene.  Tt  is  readily  soluble  in  water,  alcohol,  and  ether,  and 
crystallises  in  quadratic  prisms,  melting  at  1<<l)0.  It  volatilises  l>elow 
its  melting  point  and  DOUfl  at  about  245°.  its  aqueous  solutions  are 
coloured  green  by  ferric  salts,  the  colour  being  changed  by  alkalies  to 
red  or  violet.  It  forms  a  precipitate  with  lead  Balta  of  <  ',,11  ,  :02  :  Pb, 
and  its  solutions  reduce  gold,  silver,  and  platinum  salts.  Nitric  acid 
oxidises  it  to  oxalic  acid. 

Diaoetyl  pyrocatechin,  C6H4(OC2H30)2,  crystallises  from  alcohol 
rily  fusible  needles. 

A  tetrabrom  compound,  C6Br4(OH)2,  is  formed  by  heating  proto- 

catechuic  a  id  to  100°  with  bromine,  or  by  the  direct  action  of  the 

halogen  on  the  phenol. 

O  GH 
Methyl  pyrocatechin,   C6H4"qVt     3,  or  guaiacol,  is  obtained  by  the 

dry  distillation  of  guaiacol  resin  and  from  beech-wood  creasote,  also 
synthetically  by  heating  pyrocatechin,  potassic  hydrate,  and  potassic 
methyl  sulphate  together  to  180°  : 

^6^4.OH  +  CH  .o!  ^2  =  ^6^4!oH   3  ~*~  ^2^04 

It  is  a  colourless  liquid,  boiling  at  200°,  forming  crystalline  compounds 
with  alkalies,  e.g.  C6H4(O.CH3)OK,  and  splitting  up  on  heating  with

of  extract  of  Brazil  wood  (=  brazilin  C22H1807  and  umbelliferon 
C7H603).  It  has  also  been  obtained  from  meta-  and  para-brom-

colourless  triclinic  tables  and  prisms,  which  are  very  soluble  in  water, 
melt  at  110°,  and  boil  at  271°.  Ferric  chloride  colours  its  aqueous 
solution  deep  violet.     Ammonia  removes  the  colour.

994.  Hydro-quinone,  paradioxy-benzene,  was  first  obtained  by 
the  dry  distillation  of  quinic  and  dioxy-benzoic  acids,  or  by  oxidising 
quinic  acid  with  plumbic  peroxide.  It  is  also  obtained  by  the  decom- 
position of  its  glucoside,  arlmtia,  with  dilute  acids;  by  the  action  of 
nascent  hydrogen  or  reducing  agents  (usually  sulphurous  acid  or 
hydriodic  acid  in  aqueous  solution)  on  quinone,  C6H402 ;  by  heating 
diazo-phenol  sulphate,  obtained  by  the  action  of  nitrous  acid  on 
phenol  in  ethereal  solution,  with  excess  of  sulphuric  acid  ;  and  from 
pariodo-phenol  by  fusion  with  potassic  hydrate. 

It  forms  colourless  rhombic  plates  and  prisms,  melting  at  159° 
and  readily  subliming  in  glistening  plates.  It  has  a  sweet  taste  and 
is  readily  converted  by  oxidising  agents  into  quinhydrone  and  quinone. 

Haloid  derivatives  are  produced  by  the  reduction  of  haloid  quinone 
compounds. 

Monochlor-hydro-quinone,  C6H3C1(0H)2,  is  soluble  in  water,  alco-

The  corresponding  bromine  compounds  are  known ;  they  resemble 
the  chlorine  bodies  very  closely. 

No  iodo  hydro -quinones  are  known,  but  a  dinitro  compound, 
C6H2(N02)2(OH)2,  has  been  obtained,  forming  yellow  crystals. 

The  sulpho  compounds  of  these  phenols  have  not  been  much 
studied. 

Arbutin,  C2)H3,014,  is  a  glucoside  of  hydro-quinone.  It  is  con- 
tained in  the  leaves  of  Arbutus  uva  iirsi  and  Pyrola  umbellata,  from 
whicli  it  may  be  obtained  by  treating  the  aqueous  extract  with 
plumbic  acetate  and  decomposing  the  filtrate  with  hydric  sulphide. 
The  filtrate  from  the  plumbic  sulphide  gives  on  evaporation  silky 
needles  of  a  bitter  taste,  soluble  in  water,  difficultly  so  in  alcohol  and 
ether,  and  of  m.p.  170°.  It  yields  quinone  on  distillation  with  an 
oxidising  agent  and  a  chlorinated  quinone  on  treatment  with  chlorine. 


QUINONE.  591 

Tetranitro-arbutin,  O25H30(NO2)4O14,  is  said  to  be  produced  by 
the  action  of  concentrated  nitric  acid.  It  gives  an  acetyl  derivative, 
as  does  arbutin  itself. 

Quinone. 

995.  Bodies  of  this  class  are  formed  from  aromatic  hydro- 
carbons by  the  replacement  of  two  hydrogen  atoms  by  two  oxygen 
atoms,  which  are  supposed  to  be  so  linked  together  as  to  form  a  diad 
group,  and  as  such  are  always  combined  directly  to  the  carbon 
nucleus. 

Quinone,  C6H402,  results  from  the  oxidation  of  hydro-quinone; 
by  the  distillation  of  many  plant  extracts  with  oxidising  substances, 
most  readily  from  quinic  acid,  on  heating  with  a  mixture  of  sulphuric 
acid  and  manganic  oxide ;  by  the  oxidation  of  para-amido-phenol, 
paradiamido-benzene,  benzidine,  or  dipara-amido-diphenyl,  but  best 
of  all  from  aniline  by  oxidation  with  chromic  mixture.  It  forms 
golden  yellow  prisms,  melting  at  116°  and  which  volatilise  at  the 
ordinary  temperature.  It  has  a  pungent  odour,  somewhat  like  iodine, 
and  attacks  the  eyes  violently.  It  acts  as  a  kind  of  peroxide,  con- 
verting sulphurous  acid  into  sulphuric  : 

C6H402  +  SO(OH)2  +  OH2  =  C6H4(OH2)  +  H2S04, 

hvdro-quinone  being  produced,  in  consequence  of  which  the  consti- 

/° 

tutional  formula  C6H4/    I   has  been  assigned  to  it. 
X) 

Bodies  which  yield  quinone  on  oxidation  alone  yield  haloid 
quinones  when  submitted  to  the  simultaneous  action  of  halogens  and 
oxidising  substances.  For  the  preparation  of  chlorine  derivatives  the 
ordinary  mixture  of  manganic  oxide,  sodic  chloride,  and  sulphuric 
acid  may  be  used  with  quinic  acid.  In  this  way  mono  and  higher 
chlorine  products  are  formed. 

Mouochlor-quinone,  C6H3C102,  melts  at  100°. 

Dichlor-quinone,  C6H2C1202,  is  formed  along  with  the  mono  as 
above,  and  also  from  trichlor-phenol  by  powerful  oxidising  agents. 
It  melts  at  120°. 

Trichlor-quinone,  C6HC13.02,  melts  at  165°  and  is  insoluble  in 
water. 

Mono-  and  dibrom-quinones  have  not  been  prepared. 

All  the  chlor-quinones  yield  sulphonic  acids  by  the  action  of  acid 
alkaline  sulphites. 

996.  Quinhydrone. — This  body  is  formed  on  mixing  solutions  of 
quinone  and  hydro-quinone,  and  also  by  the  incomplete  oxidation  of 
hydro-quinone  and  by  the  incomplete  reduction  of  quinone.  It  forms 
shining  gold  green  needles. 

Its  formula  is  not  yet  determined  with  absolute  certainty.  It 
may  be  either

phenol    and    quinone    are  mixed,    and    also    by  careful  oxidation  of 
phenol : 

2CGH402  +  2HO.C6H5  =  C6H4(OH)2  +  C6H4(O.O.C6H5)2.

GOO  MONALKYL   BENZENES. 

Monalkyl  Benzenes,  C6H5.CnH2n+ 1# 

1009.  The  monalkyl  benzenes  may  all  l>e  obtained  synthetically  — 

(1)  by  the  action  of  sodium  on  a  mixture  of  a  monohaloid  benzene 
with  monohaloid  or  paraffin  diluted  with  perfectly  dry  ether  : 

C6H5Br  +  Br.CnH2n+  L  +  Na2  =  2NaBr  +  C6H5.CnH,n  + , ; 

(2)  by  distillation  of  calcic  salts  of  acids  of  the  benzoic  series  with 
excess  of  lime. 

As  far  as  is  yet  known  they  are  all  liquids.  The  nionalkjd 
derivatives  yield  on  oxidation  benzoic  acid  ;  e.g. 

C6H5.CH3  +  2Cr03  =  Cr203  +  OH2  +  C6H3.CO.OH  ; 

whilst  the  homologues  give  benzoic  acid  and  also  carbonic  anhydride 
from  the  complete  oxidation  of  the  alkyl  nucleus  : 

C6H5.CnH2n  +  1  +  2wCr03  =  wCr203  +  (?i-l)C02  +  «H20 
+  C6H5.CO.OH. 

Toluene,  Methyl-benzene,  =  ©6H.CH3. 

1010.  Toluene  may  be  obtained  from  that  portion  of  coal-tar  oil 
boiling  between  100°  and  120°;  from  brom-benzene  methyl  iodide 
and  sodium  ;  by  dry  distillation  of  the  calcic  salts  of  the  toluic  acids 
and  of  tolu-balsam,  and  from  benzylic  alcohol  by  the  action  of  strong 
alkalies.  It  is  a  colourless  liquid  of  sp.  gr.  -882  at  0°,  boiling  at  111°. 
It  gives  benzoic  acid  on  oxidation. 

Substitution  Products  of  Toluene. 

1011.  The  substitution  derivatives  of  toluene  are  much  more 
numerous  than  those  of  benzene,  the  mono  products  alone  giving,  in 
addition  to  ortho,  met*,  and  pan  isomers,  a  fourth,  in  which  a  hydrogen 
atom  of  the  metliyl  group  is  replaced;  e.g.

(i)  (2)  (»)  <4) 

The  bodies  obtained  by  substitution  as  in  (4)  scarcely  belong  to 
the  aromatic  group,  their  properties  being  more  closely  allied  to  those 
of  the  alkyl  compounds.     They  will  therefore  be  described  separately. 

The  constitution  of  the  mono-substituted  toluenes  is  generally 
settled  by  converting  them  into  the  benzene  dicarbonic  acids.  For 
example,  the  three  brom-toluenes  are  converted  by  treatment  with 
methylic  iodide  and  sodium  into  the  corresponding  ortho-,  nieta-,  and 
para-dimethyl -benzenes : 

C6H4Br.CH3  +  ICH3  +  Na2  =  Nal  +  NaBr  +  C6H4(CH3)2. 

Of  these  the  para  product  is  converted  by  oxidation  first  into  para- 


SUBSTITUTED  TOLUENES.  601 

toluic  acid,  C6H4(CH3).CO.OH,  and  further  into  terephthalic  acid, 
C6H4(CO.OH),. 

The  meta  product  similarly  yields  is<  phthalic  acid  with  chromic 
acid,  whilst  orthodimethyl-benzene  is  oxidised  to  orthotoluic  acid 
by  dilate  nitric  acid  and  is  totally  destroyed  by  chromic  acid. 

The  relationship  of  the  nitro  and  amido  compounds  to  the  phthalic 
acids  can  be  determined  in  similar  manner,  as  they  can  be  easily  con- 
verted, by  means  of  the  diazo  compounds,  into  the  corresponding 
bromine  dciivat 

1012.  Haloid  Toluene*. — Chlorine  and  bromine  act  directly  on 
toluene,  forming  substitution  derivatives,  the  place  of  substitution 
depending  on  the  temperature  employed.  When  well  cooled,  or  in 
the  presence  of  iodine  and  some  other  substances,  the  halogen  dis- 
hydrogen  from  the  aromatic  or  benzene  nucleus.  At  a  tempera- 
ture approaching  the  boiling  point  the  substitution  is  almost  entirely 
at  the  methyl  group.

are  known,  one,  or  possibly  two,  of  which  may  l>e  obtained  by  the 
direct  action  of  bromine  on  toluene,  the  remainder  from  various  broni- 
amido-toluenes  by  means  of  the  diazo  reaction  (comp.  §  982). 

Two  tribrom-toluenes  have  also  been  similarly  obtained.  One  is 
a  liquid  boiling  at  260°,  the  other  a  solid  of  m.p.  70°  and  b.p. 
290°. 

Few  iodo-toluenes  are  knovvn. 

Ortho-  and  meta-iodo-toluew ■-,  (\11,I.CH3,  are  liquids  boiling  at 
204°  and  205°  respectively.  The  para  body  melts  at  35°  and  boils 
at  I'll0.  They  are  all  obtained  by  the  action  of  hydriodic acid  on  the 
azo-toluenes. 

1013.  Xitro-toluenes. — On  treating  toluene  with  fuming  nitric 
acid  a  mixture  of  ortho-  and  para-nitro-toluene  is  produced,  from 
which  the  latter  may  be  separated  by  freezing  and  subsequent  frac- 
tional distillation.     It  melts  at  54°  and  boils  at  236°. 

Pure  ortho-nitro-toluene  may  be  obtained  from  amido-nitro- 
toluene,  C6H3(NH2).(N02).CH3,  by  the  diazo  reaction  (comp.  § 
976) ;  it  is  liquid  and  boils  at  223°. 

M^tanitro-toluene  is  obtained  by  nitrating  acetyl  paramido-toluene, 
C6H4(CH3).NH(C2H30),  conversion  into  the  diazo  compound,  and 
reduction  of  this  by  heating  with  alcohol  (§  976).     It  boils  at  231°.

melting  at  70'5°.     The  substituting  groups  have  the  positions  : 

CH3:N02.N02 1:2:4. 

Another  isomer  is  obtained  from  ortho-nitro-toluene.     It  is  liquid. 

Metanitro-toluene  gives  an  isomer  which  forms  colourless  needles, 
melting  at  60°. 

Two  trinitro-toluenes  are  known.  The  one  obtained  by  direct 
nitration  of  mono-  and  dinitro-toluenes  melts  at  80*5°  and  appeals 
to  have  the  positions  1:2:4:6. 

1014.  Amido-toluenes,  toluidines,  CGH4(NH2).CH3.  The  three 
nitro-toluenes  on  reduction  yield  the  respective  amido-toluenes. 

Ortho-toluidine  is  a  liquid  boiling  at  197°  and  not  solidifying  at 
—  20°.  On  treatment  of  its  aqueous  solution  with  bleaching  powder 
an  oxidation  product  is  formed,  which  gives  a  fine  red  coloration  with 
dilute  acids. 

Acetyl  ortho-toluidine,  C6H4(CH3).]Sr(C2H30)H,  is  moderately 
soluble  in  water  and  melts  at  107°. 

Metatoluidine  boils  at  197° ;  its  acetyl  derivative  melts  at  65*5°. 

Paratoluidine  forms  beautiful  crystals  melting  at  45°  and  boiling 
at  198°.  Its  acetyl  derivative  melts  at  145°.  It  gives  no  colour 
reaction  with  bleaching  powder  solution.  Paratoluidine  is  also  pro- 
duced by  heating  methyl  aniline  hydrochloride  to  350°  : 

C6H5.N(CH3)H2C1  =  C6H4(CH3).NH3C1. 

The  amido-toluenes  yield  similar  derivatives  to  the  amido-benzenes 
—e.g.  ureas,  sulph ureas,  guanidines,  &c. 

Diamido-toluene,  toluylene-diaminc,  C6H3.(NH2)2CH3,  is  obtained 
by  the  reduction  of  1:2:4  dinitro-toluene,  melting  at  70*5°.  It 
crystallises  from  boiling  water,  alcohol,  and  ether  in  large  prisms, 
melting  at  99°  and  boiling  at  280°. 

1015.  Hydroxy-toluenes,  C7H7.OH.  Four  of  these  bodies  are 
known. 

Methyl-phenols,  cresols,  C6H4(OH)CH3.  The  crude  phenol  from 
coal-tar  oil  contains  a  mixture  of  all  three  cresols,  para,  ortho,  and 
meta.  The  two  former  are  obtained  from  dipotassic  salts  of  para-  and 
ortho-toluene-sulphonic  acids  by  fusion  with  alkalies,  and  also  from 
the  corresponding  diazo  compounds  (§  976). 

Metacresol  may  be  obtained  by  distilling  the  calcic  salt  of  oxy- 
uvitic  acid,  C6H2(OH).(CH3).(CO.OH)2,  and  by  the  action  of  phos- 
phoric anhydride  on  thymol,  when  a  meta-cresol  phosphate  is  formed, 
which  is  decomposed  by  treatment  with  potash  and  the  cresol  ex- 
tracted by  ether.  Carvacrol  (§  1023),  the  isomer  of  thymol,  gives 
ortho-cresol  under  the  same  circumstances. 

The  cresols  behave  like  the  phenols,  forming  metallic  derivatives 
with  bases  which  react  with  the  alkvl  haloid  compounds,  giving 
ethers ;  e.g. 

C6H4(CH3).OK  +  IC2H5  =  KI  +  C6H4(CH3).O.C2K5. 

They  also  form  acetates  with  acetylic  chloride  : 

C(3H4(CH3).O.C2H30. 


ORCIN.  603 

Orthocresol  is  a  white  solid,  melting  at  31°  and  boiling  at  185°- 
186°. 

Metacresol  is  a  liquid  boiling  between  195°  and  200°. 

J'aracresol  melts  at  36°  and  boils  at  198°.  It  is  a  white  crystal- 
line substance. 

The  fourth  modification,  benzyl  alcohol,  C6H5.CH2.OH,  is  con- 
sidered elsewhere  (§  1027). 

1016.  Dihydroxy-toluenes,  C7H802  =  C6H3(CH3)(OH)2. 
Several  isomers  are  known,  but  tihey  have  not  been  well  investi- 
gated. 

1.  Orcin,  orcinol,  C6H3(CH3)(OH)2  (1:3:5?),  is  obtained  by 
heating  the  acids  derived  from  several  varieties  of  lichens,  as  orsellinic 
Mid,  C8H804  =C6H2(CH3)(OH)2.CO.OH,  lecanoric  acid,  C16H1407, 
erythric  acid,  C20H22b10,  with  alkalies,  or  better  with  milk  of  lime. 
After  saturating  with  carbonic  acid  the  orcinol  may  be  extracted  by 
ether. 

Orcin  forms  large  monoclinic  crystals  of  the  composition  : 

C7H802,OH2, 

which  melt  at  58°,  and  after  the  water  has  been  driven  off  at  86°,  and 
boil  at  290°.  Ferric  chloride  colours  its  aqueous  solutions  violet. 
It  has  a  sweet,  astringent  taste,  and  when  heated  with  acetylic  chlo- 
ride forms  a  compound,  C6H3(CH3).(O.C2H30)2,  melting  at  25°. 

Orcin  has  been  obtained  by  fusing  potassic  orthochlor-toluene 
sulphonate  with  potassic  hydrate.  It  yields  a  crystalline  compound 
with  ammonia,  which  is  rapidly  oxidised  in  the  air  to  ore  in,  ( '7 II 7N03, 
%  brownish  red  substance,  dissolving  in  alkalies  to  a  deep  purple 
3olution,  from  which  acetic  acid  precipitates  a  colouring  matter  ap- 
parently identical  with  the  litmus  from  Lecanora  tartarea. 

Several  haloid  and  nitro  derivatives  of  orcinol  are  known.

Trinitro-orcin,  obtained  by  the  action  of  cold  fuming  nitric  acid 
on  orcin,  forms  large  yellow  prisms,,  melting  at  162°.  It  acts  as  a 
strong  dibasic  acid. 

2.  Isomeric  Orcinols. — The  potassic  salts  of  the  two  toluene-disul- 
phonic  acids,  obtained  when  toluene  is  heated  with  sulphuric  acid, 
give  an  iso-orcin  on  fusion  with  potash,  which  melts  when  anhydrous 
at  87°  and  boils  at  270°.     It  is  unaltered  in  the  air. 

Homopyro-catechin  is  obtained  by  the  action  of  hydriodic  acid  on 
creosol : 

C6H3(CH3).(OH)OCH3  +  HI  =  CH3I  +  C6H3(CH3).(OH)2. 

It  is  a  colourless  oil  boiling  at  219°,  and  is  found  along  with  several  of 
its  homologues  in  beech -wood  tar.  It  has  been  very  little  investigated.

brom-toluene.     It  is  a  colourless  liquid,  boiling  at  176°. 

Isocymene,  paramethyl-isopropyl  benzene,  C6H4(CH3).CH :  (CH3)2,

Trialkyl  Benzenes,  C9H12. 

1024.  Two  isomeric  trimethyl  benzenes  occur  in  that  portion  of 
coal-tar  oil  boiling  between  163°  and  168°.  Although  they  cannot 
be  separated  by  distillation  alone,  their  different  constitution  has  been 
pretty  well  established  from  their  derivatives. 

1.  Mesitylene,  C6TI3(CH3)3  =  1  .  3  .  5,  is  formed  when  two  volumes 
of  acetone  are  distilled  with  one  volume  of  sulphuric  acid  from  retorts 
half  filled  with  sand  or  pumice  stone.  The  mesitylene  is  separated 
from  ortho  products  by  washing  with  sodic  hydrate  and  repeated 
fractional  distillation  over  metallic  sodium.  The  coal-tar  oil  boiling 
between  160°  and  170°  is  principally  mesitylene. 

It  is  a  colourless  liquid  of  high  refractive  power  and  pleasant 
odour,  boiling  at  163°.  The  relative  position  of  the  methyl  groups, 
given  as  1 : 3 : 5,  is  founded  on  the  assumption  that  the  three  acetone 
molecules  taking  part  in  the  formation  of  mesitylene  behave  similarly 
(§  954),  and  also  that  no  isomeric  mono-substitution  derivatives 
can  be  obtained  where  substitution  has  taken  place  in  the  benzene 
nucleus  only. 

On  heating  with  phosphonic  iodide  to  250°  it  is  converted  into  a 
hydrocarbon  of  the  formula  C9H18,  b.p.  138°,  which  gives  the  same 
products  on  gentle  oxidation  as  mesitylene—  e.g.  mesitylenic,  uvitic, 
and  trimesic  acids. 

Halogen  and  fuming  nitric  acid  replace  the  benzene  hydrogen  in 
mesitylene  very  easily,  but  as  yet  no  isomers  have  been  obtained  with 
certainty  which  supports  to  some  extent  the  above-mentioned  position 
of  the  methyl  groups. 

2.  Tseudo-cumene  is  obtained  pure  from  brom-meta-  and  brom-para- 
xylene.  The  position  of  the  methyl  groups  is  therefore  1:3:4.  It  is 
liquid  and  boils  at  166°.  On  oxidation  with  dilute  nitric  acid, 
xylic  and  paraxylic  acids,  C6H3(CH3)2CO.OH,  and  some  xylidic  acid, 
C6H3(CH3)(CO.OH)2,  are  produced. 

Nearly  all  its  derivatives  have  higher  melting  points  than  the 
isomeric  bodies  from  mesitylene ;  e.g.

By  the  oxidation  of  diamido-mesitylene  hydrochloride  with 
chromic  acid,  a  mesitylene  hydroquinone,  C6H02(CH3)3,  is  produced. 
It  forms    orange-coloured  needles,    which  may    be  sublimed.     It  is

moderately  soluble  in  water  and  gives  a  fine  violet  coloration  with 
alkalies. 

Pseudo-cumene  gives  a  crystalline  trinitro  derivative,  melting  at 
185°.     The  corresponding  trinitro-mesitylene  melts  at  232°. 

1025.  Other  trialkyl  benzenes  are  ethyl-dimethyl  benzene  : 

1:3:4,  boiling  at  183°-1 84°. 

Its  isomer  with  the  positions  1:3:5  boils  at  180°-182°,  and  is 
obtained  by  the  distillation  of  ethyl-methyl  ketone  with  sulphuric 
acid. 

Isoamyl-dimethyl-benzene,06H.3\^r  3Apr   pxr/prr  \  >  1:3:4, boils

C6H>.(CH8)(C,H7)a«  =  (1:3:5), 

boils  at  243°-248°.     It  gives  uvitic  acid  on  oxidation. 

Tetrd-alkyl-benzenes  include  durene  or  tetramethyl-benzene, 
05112(0113),  (1:3:4:6).  It  is  obtained  by  the  action  of  sodium  on 
monobrom-pseudo-cumene  and  ethvlic  iodide,  and  forms  prisms  melt- 
ing at  80°  and  boiling  between  189°  and  191°. 

A  dinitro  product,  C6(N02)2(CH3)4,  melting  at  205°,  and  a 
d ibroyn-durene,  C6Br2(CH3)4,  melting  at  199°,  are  known.  On  oxida- 
tion durene  yields  cumidic,  C6H2(CH3)2(CO.OH)2,  and  cumylic  : 

CiH1(CH,),CO.Off, 

acids. 

An  isomeric  tetramethyl  benzene,  (1 : 2:3: 5),  from  brom-mesity- 
lene  and  methylic  iodide,  boils  at  192°  and  does  not  solidify  at  — 18°. 

By  the  action  of  haloid  alkyl  compounds  on  benzene  under  the 
influence  of  aluminic  chloride  it  appears  possible  to  obtain  benzenes 
in  which  all  the  hydrogen  has  been  replaced  by  alcohol  radicals. 

In  this  way  mono-,  di-,  etc.,  to  hexa- ethyl  benzene  have  been 
obtained  and  isolated. 

The  hexa-ethyl  benzene,  C6(C2H5)6,  prepared  in  this  manner,  is 
said  to  resist  all  oxidising  agents.

AROMATIC  ALCOHOLS,  CnH2n_7.OH. 

1026.  The  aromatic  alcohols  are  isomeric  with  the  phenols,  bat 
contain  the  hydroxyl  in  combination  with  a  side  or  substitution 
group  of  the  benzene  ring,  whence  the  lowest  number  of  the 

benzyl  alcohol  or  phenyl  carhiwK  C7H7.OH  =  <  ,-H  ,.( 'H2.OH.  In 
consequence  of  this  constitution  they  are  analogous  in  properties  to 
the  ordinary  monatomic  alcohols.  The  primary  are  oxidised  to  alde- 
hydes ami  acids \  the  secon  '  I  sH5.CH(OH).CH„  to  ketones, 
all  of  which  maybe  again  rednoed  to  I  lie  original  body  by  nascent 
hydrogen  (§  160). 

A  convenient  method  of  obtaining  tlio  primary  alcohols  from  the 
aldehydes  consists  in  the  decomposition  of  the  latter  by  alcoholic 
potash,  whereby  the* salt  of  the  corresponding  acid  is  obtained  along 
with  the  alcohol;  e.g. 

2C6H5.CHO  +  HOK=  C6H5.CO.OK  +  CfH  .<  II  ...nil. 

Hose   primary  alcohols   derived  from  the  methyl   ba  d    be 

obtained  by  treatment  of  the  hydrocarbon  with  chlorine  or  bromine  at 
high  temperatures  (oomp*.  §  1012),  the  resalting  haloid  derivative 
being  then  heated  with  pot  .  in  order  to  convert  it  into 

the  acetate,  which  by  saponification  easily  yields  the  alcohol.  Haloid 
acids  and  phosphorus  chloride  or  bromide  reconvert  them  into  the 
haloid  compounds,  which  give  amine  bases  with  ammonia  and  mer- 
captans  with  potassic  solphhydrate.  They  form  unstable  compounds 
with  the  alkali  metals,  which  yield  ethers  with  the  haloid  derival 

The  hydrogen  of  the  be  onp  oan  also  be  substituted  in  a 

similar  manner  to  the  aromatic  hydrocarbons  themselves. 

1027.  Benzylic  alcohol,  =  (',,11  .«  II  ,.<>11,  is  isomeric  with  i 

(§  1016),  and,  as  above  described,  may  be  prepared  from  its  aldehyde, 
bitter    almond    oil,    by    treatment    with    alcoholic   potash  or   sodium 
amalgam  in  dilute  alcohol  solution  as  well  as  by  the  action  of  pot 
hydrate  on  the  chloride  of  its  radical.     It  occurs  in  nature  in  Pern 
and   Tolu  balsam,  obtained  respectively  from  the  bark  and  twi$ 

'■■nun    and    M.  in.   and  in    storax

alcohol  and  ether,  and  oxidises  first  to  benzoic  aldehyde  and  finally  to 

benzoic  acid. 

Heated  with  very  strong  caustic  potash  or  with  lime,  a  benzoate, 
toluene,  and  water  are  produced  :

hydroxy],  <fcc,  whose  metamorphoses  correspond  in  all  essentials  with 
those  of  the  benzene  substitution  products. 

By  the  direct  action  of  halogens,  nitric  acid,  and  sulphuric  anhy- 
dride on  benzoic  acid,  derivative!  of  the  nicta  group  are  formed  either 
principally  or  exclusively,  all  of  which  can  !>••  converted  into  meta- 
hydroxy-benzoic  acid.  The  same  bodies  are  obtained  by  the  oxidation 
of  the  meta-suhstitution  products  of  toluene.  Similarly  para-substitu- 
tion products  of  toluene  yield  para-enbetitoted  benzoic  acids,  whilst,  on 
the  other  hand,  the  ortho-enbetitnted  toluenes  are  generally  completely 
destroyed  on  oxidation.

It  crystallises  in  fine  silky  needles,  melting  at  176°,  and  is  nearly 
insoluble  in  cold  water.  Its  salts  give  a  deep  blue  coloration  with 
ferric  chloride,  and  yield  solid  xylenol  on  heating  with  potassic

(1 :2),  occurs  in  the  yellow  melilot  [Melilotus  officinalis),  and  is  pre-

It  crystallises  in  prisms  melting  at  82°,  which  are  pretty  readily

anhydride    ^611  *    ~tj-~£jq>  crystallising  in  tablas,  melting  at  25°  and

ortho-benzene  derivative.

nitrophenyl  propionic  acid  by  reduction  to  the  amido-acid  and  decom- 
position of  this  by  nitrous  acid.  It  melts  at  125°  and  is  readily

from  its  glucoside,  phloridzine,  O2,H24O10,2H2O.  This  latter  occurs 
in  the  root  bark  of  fruit  trees,  especially  of  apple  and  pear  trees,  from 
which  it  can  be  extracted  by  boiling  with  dilute  alcohol.  Tannin  and 
other  impurities  are  removed  from  the  solution  by  precipitation  with 
basic  plumbic  acetate,  the  filtrate  treated  with  hydric  sulphide  to 
remove  lead,  and  then  evaporated. 

Phloridzine  forms  fine  silky  needles  of  bitter  taste,  melting,  when 
anhydrous,  at  106°-109°.  At  130°  the  mass  again  solidifies,  pro- 
bably with  conversion  into  an  isomeric  modification,  and  becomes 
liquid  once  more  at  160°;  in  aqueous  solution  this  modification  is 
slowly  retransformed  into  ordinary  phloridzine.  In  presence  of  am- 
monia phloridzine  absorbs  oxygen,  acquiring  a  purple  colour  and  being 
converted  into  phloridzei'n  : 

C21H24O10  +  2NH3  +  30  =  C21H30N2O13. 

On  boiling  with  dilute  acids,  phloridzine  splits  up  into  glucose 


PHENYL  LACTIC  ACIDS.  641 

and  phloretine,  C15H1403,  which  on  cooling  separates  in  colourless 
plates.  Phloretine  is  a  salt  of  phloretic  acid  and  phloroglucin 
(§  1000),  and  is  decomposed  into  these  on  evaporation  with  solution 
of  potassic  hydrate. 

When  the  dry  alkaline  mass  is  extracted  with  alcohol,  potassic 
phloretate  dissolves,  whilst  potassium  phloroglucin  remains  behind. 
Phloretic  acid  crystallises  in  long  colourless  prisms,  melting  at  128°- 
1 30°  ;  it  is  readily  soluble  in  alcohol,  ether,  or  hot  water,  and  gives  a 
green  colour  with  ferric  chloride.  It  forms  normal  and  basic  salts, 
and  is  converted  into  paraoxy-benzoic  and  acetic  acids  on  fusion  with 
potassic  hydrate,  and  into  phlorol  (§  1018)  and  carbonic  anhydride 
on  distillation  with  lime. 

1084.  Phenyl  lactic  acids,  C6H5.C2H3(OH).CO.OH.  Two  isomeric 
acids  of  this  formula  are  known. 

1.  Phenyl  lactic  acid,  probably  /3-phenyl-a-hydroxy-propionic  acid, 
C6HvCH2.CH(OH).CO.OH,  is  obtained  by  the  action  of  sodium 
amalgam  on  phenyl-chlor-lactic  acid  (C6H5.CHCl.CH(OH).CO.OH, 
obtained  by  action  of  hypochlorous  acid  on  cinnamic  acid)  or  phenyl 
brom-lactic  acid.  It  crystallises  in  pointed  needles  readily  soluble  in 
cold,  still  more  so  in  hot  water,  melts  at  93°-94°,  and  decomposes  at 
180°  into  water  and  cinnamic  acid.  Concentrated  halogen  hydro- 
acids  convert  it  into  phenyl  halogen  propionic  acids. 

2.  Tropic  acid,  which,  from  its  decompositions  and  its  connection 
with  atropic  acid,  is  probably  u-phenyl-/>hydroxy^propionic  acid  : 

C6H5.OH  co  QH    , 

is  formed  by  heating  atropic  acid  and  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid 
at  180°  for  several  hours.  It  dissolves  in  49  parts  of  water  at  14-5°, 
is  more  readily  dissolved  in  alcohol  and  ether ;  it  crystallises  in  prisms 
and  melts  at  117°.  By  long  heating  with  hydrochloric  acid  it  loses 
water  and  is  converted  into  atropic  and  isatropic  acids. 

Higher  Homologues. 

1085.  The  isomeric  phenols  thymol  and  carvacrol  (§  1023)  are 
converted  by  the  action  of  carbonic  anhydride  and  sodium  into  two 
isomeric  acids  of  the  formula  :

thyniotic  and  carvacrotic  acids,  both  giving  intensely  blue  colorations 
with  ferric  chloride.  Thymotic  acid  crystallises  in  fine  needles ;  it 
melts  at  120°,  cannot  be  sublimed  unchanged,  and  is  difficultly  soluble 
in  water.  Heated  with  phosphoric  anhydride,  it  yields  an  ethereal 
anhydride,  thymotide,  OnH^O,,  which  is  crystalline  and  melts  at 
187°.     Carvacrotic  acid  forms  flat  needles,  melting  at  133°-134°. 

Dihydroxy-Acids  of  the  Formula  CnH2n_9(OH)2.CO.OH. 

1086.  Orsellinic  acid,  C6H2(CH3)(OH)2.CO.OH,  is  obtained  from 
lecanoric  acid  or  erythrine  by  boiling  for  a  short  time  with  baryta  or 
lime  water.     It  crystallises  in  colourless  prisms  of  both   acid   and

bitter  taste ;  it  is  readily  soluble  in  water,  alcohol,  and  ether,  and 
decomposes  at  176°  into  carbonic  anhydride  and  orcin  (§  1016)  : 

CH3.C6H2(OH)2.CO.OH  =  C02  +  CH3.C6H3(OH)2. 

It  gives  a  purple  violet  coloration  with  ferric  chloride.  With 
the  alkalies  and  alkaline  earths  it  gives  monobasic  normal  salts,  which 
on  boiling,  especially  in  presence  of  excess  of  base,  decompose  into 
orcin  and  carbonate. 

Lecanoric  acid,  C16H1407,H20,  is  an  ethereal  anhydride  of  orsel- 
linic  acid  ;  it  occurs  in  several  lichens  of  the  genera  Rocella  (especially 
R.  tinctoria),  Lecanora,  and  Variolar ia,  from  which  it  can  be  extracted 
with  ether.  It  crystallises  in  colourless  needles,  nearly  insoluble  in 
water.  On  boiling  with  water  it  splits  into  two  molecules  of  orsellinic 
acid  : 

CH3.C6H2(OH)2.CO 

|  +  H20  =  2GH3.C6H2(OH)2CO.OH. 

CH3.  C6H2.  (OHVco.OH 

On  boiling  with  alcohol  it  yields  the  corresponding  ethylic  orsel- 
linate,  CH3.CGH2(OH)2.CO.O.C2H5,  also  crystallising  in  needles. 

Erythrin,  or  erythrite  diorsellinate,  C20H22O10,  occurs  in  Rocella 
fuciformis,  from  which  it  can  be  extracted  by  means  of  cold  milk  of 
lime.  The  liquid  is  filtered  quickly  and  saturated  with  carbonic 
anhydride,  and  the  precipitate,  consisting  of  calcic  carbonate  and 
erythrin,  treated  with  alcohol  to  extract  the  latter.  Erythrin  crystal- 
lises in  needles  combined  to  spherical  aggregates ;  it  is  nearly  insoluble 
in  cold  water,  and  on  long  boiling  with  the  latter  is  converted  into 
orsellinic  acid  and  pier o -erythrin,  or  erythrite  mono-orsellinate  :

Picro-erythrin  forms  crystals  of  bitter  taste,  C12H1607,H20,  and 
on  boiling  with  lime  water  is  converted  into  carbonic  acid,  orcin,  and 
erythrite  (§  770). 

1087.  Everninic  acid,  C9H10O4,  and  evemic  acid,  C17H1607,  also 
belong  to  the  derivatives  of  orsellinic  acid.  Evernic  acid  is  obtained 
from  the  lichen  Evernia  prunastri  by  treatment  with  milk  of  lime 
and  precipitation  with  hydrochloric  acid.  It  is  insoluble  in  water,  and 
by  boiling  with  lime  water  for  not  too  long  a  time  is  decomposed  into 
everninic  acid  and  orsellinic  acid,  or  carbonic  acid  and  orcin.  Everninic 
acid  crystallises  in  fine  needles,  melting  at  157°,  readily  soluble 
in  alcohol,  ether,  and  boiling  water,  nearly  insoluble  in  cold  water. 
It  is  coloured  violet  by  ferric  chloride.  By  fusion  with  potassic 
hydrate  it  yields  orcin  and  carbonic  acid.  From  this  everninic  acid 
appears  to  be  methyl  orsellinic  acid  : 

OH,AH,(OH);°£**| 

and  evernic  acid  an  ethereal  anhydride  of  everninic  and  orsellinic 
acids. 

1088.  Two  acids  are  known  isomeric  with  everninic  acid — hydro-

caffeic  acid  and  umbellic  acid.   They  are  probably  both  represented  by 
the  formula  C6H3(OH)2.C2H4.CO.OH. 

Hydrocaffeic  acid  is  obtained  by  the  action  of  sodium  amalgam 
on  caffeic  acid,  C9H804.  It  forms  colourless  rhombic  prisms,  readily 
soluble  in  cold  water.  It  yields  amorphous  salts,  which  decompose 
on  exposure  to  air  from  oxidation,  whose  solutions  reduce  ammoniacal 
solutions  of  copper  and  silver  and  give  a  dark  cherry-red  colour  with 
ferric  chloride. 

From  its  connection  with  caffeic  acid  it  would  appear  to  have  the 
formula  (HO)2  :C6H3.CH2.CH2.CO.OH.  On  fusion  with  potassic 
hydrate  it  yields  pyrocatechin. 

Umbellic  acid,  which  yields  resorcin  on  fusion  with  potassic  hy- 
drate, is  obtained  by  the  action  of  sodium  amalgam  on  an  alkaline 
solution  of  umbelliferone,  C9H603.  It  forms  colourless  granular 
crystals,  melting  below  125°  and  difficultly  soluble  in  cold  water.  Its 
salts  also  oxidise  on  exposure  to  air,  and  reduce  alkaline  silver  and 
copper  solutions. 

1089.  Tyrosine,  QJ&\  !N03,  doubtless  belongs  to  the  disubstitution 
products  of  monobasic  aromatic  acids  of  the  formula  C9H10O2.  It 
has  not  yet  been  prepared  synthetically,  but  has  only  been  obtained, 
together  with  leucine  (§  750),  aspartic  acid  (§  863),  and  glutamic  acid 
(§  866,  3),  as  a  decomposition  product  of  different  albuminoids,  equally 
whether  the  decomposition  has  been  effected  by  fusing  alkalies,  by 
acids,  or  as  in  putrefaction  by  the  action  of  ferment-like  bodies.  This 
last  method  of  formation  explains  its  occurrence  in  the  animal 
organism.  It  is  best  obtained  in  large  quantity  by  boiling  horn 
shavings  with  a  mixture  of  2  parts  sulphuric  acid  and  8  parts  water 
for  twelve  hours,  the  water  evaporated  being  replaced ;  the  liquid  is 
then  rendered  alkaline  by  milk  of  lime,  the  nitrate  evaporated  to  a 
small  volume  and  over-saturated  with  acetic  acid.  On  long  standing 
tyrosine  separates,  whilst  leucine,  &c,  remain  in  solution.  It  is  puri- 
fied by  hot  water,  and  then  forms  bunches  of  fine  silky  needles,  soluble 
in  150  parts  of  boiling  water  and  1,900  parts  of  cold  water,  scarcely 
soluble  in  alcohol,  insoluble  in  ether.  It  can  be  recognised  by  the 
red  colour  obtained  when  its  solution  is  heated  with  mercuric  nitrate 
and  nitrous  acid,  and  by  the  violet  coloration  on  heating  with 
sulphuric  acid,  neutralising  with  baric  carbonate,  and  adding  ferric 
chloride. 

Tyrosine  dissolves  readily  in  mineral  acids,  forming  saline  com- 
pounds, e.g.  C9HnN03.HCl,  crystallising  in  needles  ;  it  also  dissolves 
in  ammonia  solution  and  caustic  alkalies.  With  baryta  water  it 
gives  prisms  of  barium  tyrosine,  C9H9BaN03,2H20.  By  mixing 
tyrosine  solutions  with  argentic  nitrate  two  compounds  (C9H10AgNO3, 
which  is  crystalline,  and  C9H9Ag2N03,  a  precipitate)  are  obtained 
according  to  the  concentration  and  quantity  of  the  silver  solution. 
Tyrosine  behaves  similarly  to  the  glycines.  By  fusion  with  potassic 
hydrate  it  yields  ammonia  and  the  potassic  salts  of  paraoxy  ben  zoic 
and  acetic  acids;  by  the  action  of  chlorine  and  bromine  it  gives 
chloranil  and  bromanil  (§  1005).  From  this  tyrosine  is  probably  a  para 
compound  of  the  formula  NH2.C6H4.C2H3(OH).CO.OH,  or 
HO.C6H4.C2H3(NH2).CO.OH. 

Excess  of  dilute  nitric  acid  converts  tyrosine  into  brownish  yellow

crystals  of  nitro-tyrosine  nitrate,  C9HI0(NO2)NO3.,HNO3,  from  whose 
aqueous  solution  ammonia  precipitates  sulphur -yellow  needles  of 
nitro-tyrosine,  C9H10(NO2)lSrO3.  On  heating  with  nitric  acid  dinitro- 
tyrosine,  C9H9(N02)2lSr03,  is  formed,  crystallising  in  golden  yellow 
plates;  it  does  not  yield  salts  with  acids.  Concentrated  sulphuric 
acid  converts  tyrosine  into  several  sulphonic  acids,  e.g. 

C9H10(SO2.OH)NO3, 

whose  baric  salts  are  coloured  violet  by  ferric  chloride.

CINNAMIC   GROUP. 

1090.  The  chief  representatives  of  the  cinnamic  group  can  be 
viewed  as  phenyl  derivatives  of  allyl  alcohol,  acrolein,  and  acrylic 
acid,  just  as  the  aromatic  alcohols,  aldehydes,  and  acids  previously 
described  may  be  considered  as  the  phenyl  substitution  products  of 
the  alcohols  CnH2n  +  t.OH,  their  aldehydes,  and  the  fatty  acids.  The 
compounds  in  this  group  all  contain  phenyl  in  combination  with  a 
tricarbon  nucleus,  in  which  two  of  the  carbon  atoms  are  in  divalent 


Cinnamic  Alcohol. 

1091.  Styryl  alcohol,  or  phmyl-allyl  alcohol  : 

C9H10O  =  C6H5.CH:CH.CH2.OH, 

is  obtained  by  distillation  of  its  cirmamate  with  potassic  hydrate,  also 
in  smaller  quantity  by  heating  cinnamic  aldehyde  with  alcoholic 
potassic  hydrate  (comp.  §  1026).  It  crystallises  in  needles  of  hyacinth- 
like odour,  melts  at  33°,  distils  at  250°,  is  difficultly  soluble  in  water, 
readily  in  alcohol  and  ether.  It  is  converted  into  cinnamic  acid  on 
careful  oxidation,  and  when  treated  with  the  halogen  hydro-acids 
yields  styryl  haloids — e.g.  styryl  chloride,  C9H9C1,  and  styryl  iodide — 
which  unite  with  ammonia  to  styryl  amnionic  chloride,  C9H9NH3C1, 
&c.  On  gentle  heating  of  styryl  alcohol  and  boron  trioxide  styryl 
ether,  (C9H9)20,  is  obtained  as  an  oily  liquid. 

Styryl  alcohol  unites  directly  with  bromine,  when  the  two  in- 
gredients in  solution  in  chloroform  are  mixed,  forming  cinnamic  alcohol 
dibromide,  or  styryl  dibromide  hydrate,  C6H5.CHBr.CHBr.CH2.OH 
(comp.  §  681),  which  crystallises  from  alcohol  or  ether  in  colourless 
needles  or  tables  melting  at  74°.  By  heating  with  concentrated  hydro- 
bromic  acid  it  is  converted  into  styryl  tribromide : 

C6H5.CHBr.CHBr.CH2Br, 

forming  shining  needles,  melting  at  124°.  This,  on  long  heating  with 
water,  is  converted  into  the  trivalent  alcohol : 

C6H5.CH(OH).CH(OH).CH2(OH), 

stycerine,  or  phenyl  glycerin,  readily  soluble  in  water  and  alcohol  and 
left  on  evaporation  as  a  gummy  mass. 

1092.  Cinnamic  aldehyde,  C9H80  =  C6H5.CH:CH.CHO,  forms 
the  chief  constituent  of  the  essential  oil  of  cinnamon  and  cassia ;  it 
is  obtained  by  oxidation  of  cinnamic  alcohol  by  aid  of  platinum  black, 


646  CINNAMIC  GROUP. 

and  is  prepared  synthetically  by  saturation  of  a  mixture  of  benzal- 
dehyde  and  acetic  aldehyde  with  hydrochloric  acid  (comp.  §  765) : 

C6H5.CHO  +  CH3.CHO  =  H20  +  C6H5.CH:CH.CHO. 

It  forms  a  difficultly  soluble  crystalline  compound  with  hydric  sodic 
sulphite,  and  can  thus  be  readily  separated  from  cinnamic  alcohol 
and  obtained  on  heating  the  purified  crystals  with  soda  solution. 

Cinnamic  aldehyde  is  a  colourless  oil  of  strong  cinnamon  odour, 
heavier  than  water ;  on  exposure  to  air  it  absorbs  oxygen  and  is 
slowly  converted  into  cinnamic  acid.  It  boils  at  247°-248°  with 
slight  decomposition  and  volatilises  readily  in  water  vapour.  It 
reacts  with  dry  ammonia,  yielding  water  and  hydrodnnamide  (comp. 
§1031): 

3C6H5.C2H2.CHO  +  2NH3  =  3H20  +  (C6H5.C2H2.CH:)3N2. 

1093.  Cinnamic  acid,  C9H802  =  C6H5.CH:CH.CO.OH,  fi-p/tenyl 
acrylic  acid,  occurs  naturally  in  balsams  (storax,  Tolu  and  Peru 
balsams)  and  resins  (benzoin),  and  is  formed  by  the  oxidation  of  its 
alcohols  and  ethers,  and  synthetically  by  the  action  of  sodium  and 
carbonic  anhydride  on  a-brom-styrolene  (§  1042); 

C6H5.CH :  CHBr  +  C02  +  Na2  =  NaBr  +  C6H5.CH :  CH.CO.ONa ; 

by  heating  benzaldehyde  with  chlor-acetal : 

C6H5.CHO  +  CH3.CO.Cl  =  HC1  +  C6H5.CH:CH.CO.OH  ; 

and  by  heating  benzaldehyde  with  acetic  anhydride  and  sodic  acetate, 
the  reaction  in  this  case  not  being  clearly  understood.  It  can  be  pre- 
pared in  largest  quantity  from  storax.  This  is  first  heated  with  soda 
solution  in  a  distilling  vessel,  when  styrolene  distils  with  the  water 
vapour,  whilst  the  free  cinnamic  acid  goes  into  solution  as  sodic  salt. 
The  residue  containing  styracine  is  then  boiled  with  concentrated 
solution  of  Bodic  hydrate,  when  styryl  alcohol  passes  over.  The 
filtered  solution  of  sodic  salt  is  then  decomposed  by  hydrochloric  acid, 
the  separated  cinnamic  acid  purified  by  solution  in  ammonia  and  re- 
precipitation  and  finally  distilled. 

Cinnamic  acid,  like  benzoic  acid,  crystallises  from  boiling  water  in 
needles,  from  alcohol  in  large,  readily  cleavable  rhombic  prisms.  It 
melts  at  133°,  boils  at  290°,  and  is  difficultly  soluble  in  cold  water. 
Its  salts  resemble  those  of  benzoic  acid. 

On  gentle  heating  with  dilute  sulphuric  acid  and  potassic  chromate 
or  permanganate  it  is  first  converted  into  benzaldehyde  : 

C6H5.CH:CH.CO.OH  +  40  =  C6H5.CHO  +  2C02  +  H20, 

and  finally  into  benzoic  acid.  It  unites  with  nascent  hydrogen,  form- 
ing /3-phenyl-propionic  acid  (§  1074),  and  is  decomposed  on  heating 
with  lime  into  carbonic  anhydride  and  styrolene  (§  1042),  by  fusion 
with  potassic  hydrate  into  benzoic  and  acetic  acids  (comp.  §  790)  : 

C6H5.CH:CH.CO.OK  +  HOK  +  H20  =  C6H5.C0.0K 
-I-  CH3.CO.OK  +  H2. 

1094.  Ethereal  salts  of  cinnamic  acid  are  prepared  like  those  of 
other  monobasic  acids.     Ethylic  ciiiuamate.  ( '9H7O.O.C2H5,  is  an  oil 


ATKOPIC  ACID.  647 

boiling  at  267°.     Benzylic  cinnamate,  C9H7O.O.CH2.C6Hs,  or  cin- 
>  in,  occurs  naturally  in  Tolu  and  Peru  balsams;  it  crystallises  in 
shining  prisms,  melts  at  39°,  and  can  only  be  distilled   unchanged 
under  reduced  pressure.      Cinnamic  cinnamate.: 

C6H5.C2H2.CO.O.CH2.C2H2.C6H3, 

or  styracine,  is  contained  in  large  quantity  in  storax,  and  is  left  as  a 
colourless  mass  after  long  digestion  with  soda  solution.  It  crystallises 
from  ether  alcohol  in  groups  of  fine  needles  and  melts  at  44°. 

Cinnamic  anhydride,  (C6H5.C2H2.CO)20,  "is  obtained  in  colourless 
crystals  by  the  action  of  phosphoric  oxychloride  on  sodic  cinnamate ; 
it  melts  at  127°  and  is  nearly  insoluble  in  alcohol.  Phosphoric 
chloride  converts  cinnamic  acid  into  chlor-cinnamyl  : 

C6ri5.C2rl2.C0.01, 

a  heavy  yellow  oil,  boiling  at  260°-262°.  Water  slowly  converts  it  into 
cinnamic  and  hydrochloric  acids  ;  with  alcohol  it  gives  ethylic  cin- 
namate, and  ammonia  gas  converts  it  into  cinnamide  : 

C6H5.C2H2.CO.NH2, 

a  crystalline  mass  closely  resembling  benzamide. 

Isomers  of  Cinnamic  Add. 

1095.  Atropic  and  isotropic  acids  are  obtained  together  by  heating 
tropic  acid  with  baryta  or  hydrochloric  acid,  and  are  therefore  also 
formed  in  the  preparation  of  tropic  acid  from  atropine.  Atropic  acid 
is  obtained  in  largest  quantity  when  baryta  is  used,  whilst  hydro- 
chloric acid  gives  principally  isatropic  add.  Atropic  acid,  a-phenyl 
acrylic  acid,  crystallises  in  monoclinic  tables;  it  melts  at  106°-107°, 
is  moderately  soluble  in  hot  water,  but  requires  700-^00  parts  of  cold 
water  for  solution.     Its  formation  is  represented  by  the  equation  : 

C6H5.CHC0£H    =  H20  +  C6H5.CTC0  £H 

It  unites  with  nascent  hydrogen,  forming  a-phenyl-propionic  acid 
(§  1074);  fusion  with  potassic  hydrate  converts  it  into  phenyl-acetic 
and  formic  acids ;  chromic  acid  oxidises  it  into  benzoic  acid,  carbonic 
anhydride,  and  water. 

Isatropic  acid  crystallises  in  thin  rhombic  plates,  is  more  difficultly 
soluble  in  water  than  the  preceding,  melts  at  200°,  is  not  oxidised  by 
chromic  acid,  and  does  not  combine  with  nascent  hydrogen.  From 
these  reactions  it  is  probably  a  polymer  (diatropic  acid  1) 

Addition  Products  of  Cinnamic  Acid. 

1096.  Cinnamic  acid  combines  with  hydrogen  (as  already  men- 
tioned), the  halogens,  hydrogen  haloids,  and  hypochlorous  acid. 

Cinnamic  acid  dibromide,  a-phenyl-dibroni-propionic  acid  : 

C6H5.CHBr.CHBr.CO.OH, 

is  obtained  by  addition  of  bromine  to  a  solution  of  cinnamic  acid  in 
carbonic  disulphide ;  it  crystallises  in  colourless  rhombic  plates  and 


648  CINNAMIC   GROUP. 

is  insoluble  in  cold  water.     On  boiling  with  water  it  yields  parti)' 
/3-brom-styrolene,  carbonic  anhydride,  and  hydrobromic  acid  : 

C6H5.CHBr.CHBr.CO.OII  =  C6H5.CBr:CH2  +  C02  +  HBr, 

partly  hydrobromic  acid  and 

Phenylrbrom-lactic  acid,  C6H5.CHBr.CH(OH).CO.OH,  in  the  form 
of  hexagonal  tables  containing  water  of  crystallisation ;  when  an- 
hydrous it  melts  at  125°. 

Phenyl-chlor-lactic  acid,  C6H5.CHCl.CH(OH).CO.OH,  is  the  ad- 
dition product  of  hypochlorous  acid  with  cinnamic  acid,  and  is  most 
readily  obtained  when  a  solution  of  equal  molecules  of  sodic  carbonate 
and  cinnamate  is  saturated  with  chlorine,  the  solution  of  sodic  salts 
acidulated  with  hydrochloric  acid,  and  after  evaporation  extracted 
with  ether.  The  acid  crystallises  with  one  molecule  of  water  in 
hexagonal  plates,  and  then  melts  at  70°-80°;  when  anhydrous  it 
melts  at  104°. 

Aqueous  solutions  of  both  phenyl  halogen  lactic  acids  are  con- 
verted by  sodium  amalgam  into  phenyl  lactic  acid. 

Substitution  Products  of  Cinnamic  Acid. 

1097.  Two  varieties  are  known,  according  as  the  substitution 
occurs  in  the  C2H2  group  or  in  the  benzene  nucleus.  The  first  includes 
both  the  isomeric 

Phenyfcbrom- acrylic  acids  : 

C6H5.CH:CBr.CO.OH  and  C6H5.CBr:CH.CO.OH. 

They  are  both  formed  at  the  same  time  by  the  decomposition  of 
cinnamic  acid  dibromide  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate,  and  are 
separated  by  aid  of  their  ammonic  salts.  The  acid  of  the  difficultly 
soluble  salt,  commonly  termed  a-brom-cinnamic  acid,  crystallises  in 
long  shining  needles,  melts  at  130°-131°,  and  can  be  volatilised  un- 
changed, whilst  the  acid  of  the  more  readily  soluble  salt,  fi-brom- 
cinnamic  acid,  crj'stallises  in  hexagonal  plates,  melts  at  120°,  and  is 
converted  into  the  isomeric  ft -acid  on  distillation. 

1098.  The  second  variety  of  substitution  products  are  represented 
by  the  nitro-cinnamic  acids,  the  coumaric  acids,  and  their  derivatives. 

Nitro-cinnamic  acids,  C6H4(N02).C2H2.CO.OH,  are  formed  by  the 
slow  addition  of  cinnamic  acid  to  cold  concentrated  nitric  acid, 
which  must  be  free  from  nitrous  acid  in  order  to  prevent  oxidising 
action. 

In  order  to  separate  the  resulting  isomers  they  are  converted 
into  ethylic  salts,  of  which  one,  ethylic  paranitro-cinnamate,  is  nearly 
insoluble  in  alcohol,  whilst  ethylic  orthonitro- cinnamate  is  readily 
soluble.  By  saponification  of  these  bodies  and  decomposition  of  the 
aqueous  solutions  of  the  alkali  salts  with  mineral  acids  the  insoluble 
free  nitro-cinnamic  acids  are  obtained.  Paranitro-cinnamic  acid 
crystallises  in  fine  needles ;  it  melts  at  265°  and  is  very  difficultly 
soluble  in  alcohol.  Orthonitro-cinnamic  acid  is  more  readily  soluble 
in  alcohol ;  it  melts  at  232°.  On  oxidation  the  first  is  converted  into 
para,  the  latter  into  ortho-nitro  benzoic  acid. 

Tin  and  hydrochloric  acid  convert  the  nitro-cinnamic  acids  into 
amido-cinnamic  acids,  C6H4(NH2).C2H2.CO.OH. 


COUMARINE.  649 

Cinnamic  acid  dissolves  in  Nordhausen  sulphuric  acid,  yielding 
sulpho-cinnamic  acid,  C6H4(S02.OH).C2H2.CO.OH,  which  crystal- 
lises in  prisms  with  3H20.  It  is  readily  soluble  in  water  and  generally 
yields  soluble  salts. 

Hydroxy-Cinnamic  Acids.

1099.  Monhydroxy-cinnamic  acids,  C6H4'p  „   p^  qtt  • 

1.  Coumaric  acid,  or  orthohydroxy-cinnamic  acid,  occurs,  together 
with  hydro-coumaric  acid,  in  Melilotus  officinalis,  and  is  readily  ob- 
tained by  boiling  coumarine  with  alkalies.  It  crystallises  in  colourless 
prisms,  readily  soluble  in  alcohol  and  hot  water ;  it  melts  at  195°  and 
is  decomposed  into  potassic  acetate  and  salicylate  on  heating  with 
potassic  hydrate.  Its  alkali  salts  show  a  fine  fluorescence  in  aqueous 
solution.     Ferric  chloride  gives  no  violet  colour  with  it.

corresponding  to  lactide  and  salicylide  (§  10G2),  occurs  in  Asperula 
odorata,  Melilotus  officinalis,  Anthoxanthum  odoratum,  and  especially 
in  tonka  beans,  the  fruit  of  Dipterix  odorata,  in  the  latter  frequently 
in  fine  crystals.  It  is  extracted  by  alcohol,  and  after  evaporation  of 
the  greater  part  of  the  solvent  separated  by  addition  of  water  and 
cooling.  It  crystallises  in  colourless  prisms  of  very  agreeable  odour, 
is  difficultly  soluble  in  cold  water;  it  melts  at  67°  and  boils  at  290°. 
It  unites  with  chlorine  and  bromine,  forming  dihaloids,  e.g. 

C9H6Br202, 

which  on  heating  yield  halogen-substituted  coumarines  : 

C6H4!c2HBr!CO' 

or  (by  also  uniting  with  water)  the  respective  coumaric  acids. 

The  synthesis  of  coumarine  and  its  homologues  (which  latter  do 
not  occur  naturally)  by  heating  sodium  salicylic  aldehyde  (§  1033) 
with  the  anhydrides  of  the  acetic  series  is  very  interesting.  Acetic 
anhydride  so  treated  gives  coumarine  :

Butyric  anhydride  gives  a  body  melting  at  70°-71°  and  boiling

650  CINNAMIC   GEO  UP. 

2.  Paracoumaric  acid,  or  'parahydroxy-cinnamic  acid,  isomeric 
with  coumaric  acid,  is  obtained  by  boiling  a  solution  of  aloes  acidu- 
lated with  dilute  sulphuric  acid,  and  withdrawn  from  the  filtered 
liquid  by  shaking  with  ether.  It  crystallises  in  brittle  needles, 
readily  soluble  in  hot  water  and  alcohol,  and  melts  at  179°-180°.  It 
unites  with  nascent  hydrogen,  forming  hydro-paracoumaric  acid 
(§  1083,  3),  and  gives  acetate  and  paraoxy-benzoate  on  fusion  with 
potassic  hydrate. 

Only  one  dihydroxy-cinnamic  acid  is  yet  known. 

Caffeic  acid,  C9H804  =  C6H3  qjt  .qtt  qq  qtt-      I*  *s   obtained 

from  extract  of  coffee  by  boiling  with  potassic  hydrate  and  addition 
of  sulphuric  acid ;  it  forms  yellowish  prisms  and  plates  scarcely 
soluble  in  cold  water,  more  readily  in  hot  water,  and  is  very  soluble  in 
alcohol  and  ether.  Ferric  chloride  gives  a  grass-green  coloration, 
changing  to  red  on  addition  of  soda.  On  dry  distillation  it  yields 
pyrocatechin  amongst  other  products;  fusion  with  potassic  hydrate 
converts  it  into  potassic  acetate  and  protocatechuate  : 

C6H3(OH)2.CH:CH.CO.OK  +  HOK  +  H20  =  H2 
+  C6H3(OH)2.CO.OK  +  CH3.CO.OK. 

It  unites  with  nascent  hydrogen,  forming  hydrocaffeic  acid. 

Caffetannic  acid,  a  glucoside,  accompanies  caffeic  acid  in  coffee 
extract ;  it  can  be  precipitated  from  the  alcoholic  extract  by  plumbic 
acetate,  and  the  resulting  precipitate  suspended  in  water  and  decom- 
posed with  sulphuretted  hydrogen.  The  nitrate  on  evaporation  yields  a 
yellowish  gummy  mass  of  the  acid.  Its  solutions  are  coloured  green 
by  ferric  chloride,  and  on  boiling  with  potassic  hydrate  split  up  into 
caffeic  acid  and  an  amorphous  sugar-like  substance.  Its  solution  in 
lime  water  readily  absorbs  oxygen,  becoming  first  a  fine  green,  then 
blue,  and  finally  brown. 

1100.  The  following  bodies  also  appear  to  belong  to  the  cinnamic 
group  : — 

Anethol,  C10H12O,  is  contained  in  the  oils  of  anise,  fennel,  star 
anise,  &c,  and  crystallises  out  when  the  temperature  is  lowered. 
After  pressing  and  recrystallisation  from  ether  it  forms  colourless 
shining  prisms,  melting  at  21°  and  boiling  at  232°,  sp.  gr.  1014. 
It  unites  with  hydrochloric  acid,  forming  a  liquid  compound  : 

C10H13ClO. 

Potassic  hydrate  at  200°  decomposes  anethol  into  para-oxy benzoic 
acid  and  anol,  C9H10O.  This  latter  is  a  phenol-like  body,  crystallising 
in  white  plates,  melting  at  92*5°.  Boiling  dilute  nitric  acid  oxidises 
anethol  to  anisic  aldehyde  (§  1033);  chromic  and  sulphuric  acids 
oxidise  it  to  anisic  acid  (§  1065).  In  both  cases  oxalic  and  carbonic 
acids  are  also  formed.  Concentrated  sulphuric  acid,  phosphoric  acid, 
zincic  chloride,  and  iodine  convert  it  into  isomeric  or  polymeric  modi- 
fications. 

From  these  reactions  the  formula  for  anethol  is  probably  : 

CH3.O.C6H4.C3H5  (1:4), 

in  which,  however,  the  constitution  of  the  C3H5  group  still  remains 
uncertain. 


EUGENOL.  65  i 

1101.  Eugenol,  C10H12O2,  isomeric  with  cumic  acid,  is  contained 
in  the  ethereal  oils  of  Eugenia  caryophyllata,  Myrtus  pimenta,  Persea 
caryophyttata,  and  Canella  alba,  from  which  it  can  be  extracted  by 
shaking  with  potassic  hydrate  and  obtained  in  a  state  of  purity  by 
precipitating  the  clear  solution  with  carbonic  anhydride.  It  is  a 
colourless  oil  of  aromatic  odour ;  it  boils  at  253°  and  has  sp.  gr.  1*068 
at  14°.  The  potassic  compound  has  the  formula  C10HnKO2;  the 
baric  compound,  (C10HnO2)2Ba,  forms  difficultly  soluble  nacreous 
plates.  Treated  with  chlor-acetyl  and  chlor-benzoyl  it  gives  acetyl 
and  benzoyl  derivatives.  Benzoyl  eugenol,  C^HnOa-CyHgO,  forms 
colourless  needles  melting  at  50°.  Hydriodic  acid  decomposes  eu- 
genol into  methylic  iodide  and  a  red  resin,  C9H10O2: 

C.AioH1202  +  HI  =  CH3I  -f  C9H10O2. 

Fusion  with  potassic  hydrate  converts  it  into  protocatechuic  acid, 
acetic  acid,  carbonic  anhydride,  and.  hydrogen.  From  these  reactions 
the  formula 

c6H3(OHyc^:C3HCH3 

may  be  assigned  to  eugenol. 

By  the  action  of  sodium  and  carbonic  anhydride  eugenol  is  con- 
verted into  the  sodic  salt  of  eugetinic  add  : 

r0H  [och 

•  C6H3 1  O.CH3  +  Na2  +  C02  =  C6H2^  "^3    +  ^ 

from  whose  solution  eugetinic  acid  is  precipitated  by  hydrochloric 
acid.  It  forms  colourless  prisms,  melts  at  124°,  and  is  difficultly 
soluble  in  water.  At  higher  temperatures  it  again  decomposes  into 
carbonic  anhydride  and  eugenol ;  with  ferric  chloride  it  gives  a  deep 
blue  coloration. 

1102.  Umhelliferone,      C9H603  =  CGH3(OH)"p'T7~-p^,      occurs 

amongst  the  products  of  the  dry  distillation  of  galbanum  and  the 
resins  from  other  umbelliferse ;  it  crystallises  in  rhombic  prisms,  melts 
at  240°,  and  dissolves  with  difficulty  in  water,  the  solution  having  a 
blue  fluorescence.  Treated  with  chlor-acetyl  it  gives  a  monacetate, 
C9H5(C2H30)03 ;  with  sodium  amalgam  and  water,  the  sodic  salt  of 
umbellic  acid  (§  1088). 

1103.  Homologues  of  Cinnamic  Acid. — These  bodies  are  all  pre- 
pared by  heating  benzaldehyde  or  cumic  aldehyde  with  an  anhydride

present.     The  acids  so  far  obtained  are  given  below.

652  CINNAMIC   GROUP. 

Phenyl  Propiolic  Acid,  C9H602. 

1104.  Phenyl  propiolic  acid  stands  in  the  same  relation  to  phenyl 
propionic  and  cinnamic  acids  as  the  acids  of  the  CnH2n_402  series 
(§  854)  to  the  fatty  acids  CnH2n02  and  the  members  of  the  acrylic 
acid  series. 

It  is  prepared  synthetically  by  the  action  of  sodium  and  carbonic 
anhydride  on  />brom-styrolene  : 

C6H5.CBr  :CH2  +  Na2  +  CO,  =  C6H5.C  \  C.CO.ONa  +  NaBr  +  H2, 

and  by  the  direct  union  of  sodium  phenyl  acetylene  (§  1042)  with 
carbonic  anhydride  : 

C6H5.C  ;  CNa  +  C02  =  C6H5.C  :  C.CO.ONa. 

It  is  further  obtained  by  heating  a-brom-cinnamic  acid  with  alcoholic 
potassic  hydrate  : 

C6H5.C2HBr.CO.OK  +  KOH  =  KBr  +  H20 
+  C6H5.C :  C.CO.OK. 

It  crystallises  in  colourless,  volatile  needles,  melts  between  136° 
and  137°,  and  is  readily  soluble  in  alcohol,  ether,  and  hot  water. 
Heated  with  water  at  120°  it  splits  up  into  carbonic  anhydride  and 
phenyl  acetylene  : 

C6H3.C  ;  C.CO.OH  =  C02  +  C6H5.C :  CH. 

It  unites  directly  with  four  atoms  of  bromine,  forming 

C6H5.CBr2.CBr2.CO.OH, 

and  with  four  atoms  of  nascent  hydrogen  yielding  phenyl  propionic 
acid.     Chromic  acid  oxidises  it  to  benzoic  acid.

POLYB&SIC  AROMATIC  ACIDS. 

1105.  The  polybasic  aromatic  acids  contain  several  acid  groups, 
CO.OH,  united  to  the  benzene  nucleus,  cither  directly  or  by  means  of 
a  hydrocarbon  group.  Their  general  properties,  reactions,  and  methods 
of  preparation  correspond  to  those  of  the  monobasic  acids,  but  they 
unite  more  readily  with  nascent  hydrogen  with  formation  of  additive 
products. 

Dibasic  Acids. 

Phenylene  D  (carbonic  Acids,  C8H604  =  C6H4(CO.OH)2. 

1106.  The  three  isomeric  phenylene  dicarbonic  acids  have  already 
been  referred  to  (§  954)  in  reference  to  the  aid  afforded  by  them  in 
determining  the  constitution  of  the  isomeric  disubstituted  benzene 
derivatives.  Their  calcic  Baits  all  yield  benzene  when  submitted  to 
dry  distillation  with  lime. 

1107.  Phthalic  arid,  or  orthophenylene  dicarbonic  acid,  (1:2),  is 
formed  by  the  oxidation  of  anthracene  and  many  of  its  derivatives, 
also  from  several  bodies  derived  from  anthracene — such  as  alizarine 
and  purpurine — by  oxidation  with  nitric  acid,  or  manganic  dioxide  and 
sulphuric  acid,  and  in  small  quantities  by  the  action  of  the  latter  on 
benzene  or  benzoic  acid.  It  crystallises  in  shining  colourless  tables  or 
prisms,  is  readily  soluble  in  hot  water,  alcohol,  and  ether,  melts  at 
182°,  and  at  higher  temperatures  decomposes  into  water  and  phthalic 
anhydride,  which  volatilise.  On  heating  with  hydriodic  acid  it  yields 
carbonic  anhydride  and  benzoic  acid  : 

C6H4(CO.OH)2  =  C02  +  C6H5.CO.OH. 

Benzoic    acid  is  also  obtained  on    heating  two    molecules  of  calcic 

phthalate  with  one  molecule  of  lime  at   330°-350°.     Phthalic  acid 

forms  hydric  and  normal  salts;  they  are  crystalline  and,  with  the 

exception  of  the  alkali  salts,  difficultly  soluble  in  water.     The  baric 

salt,  C6H4(CO.O)2Ba,  crystallises  in  plates.    Dimethylic  and  diethylic 

phthalates  are  obtained  by  saturation  of  solutions  of  the  acid  in  the 

respective  alcohols,  are  both    colourless  oily   liquids  which  can   be 

distilled. 

CO 
Phthalic  anhydride,  C8H403  =  C6H4'pQ*0,  is  formed  directly  by 

subliming  phthalic  acid,  and  also  by  treating  phthalic  acid  with  one 
molecule  of  phosphoric  chloride  (comp.  §  835).  It  crystallises  in  long 
shining  needles,  melts  at  127°-128°,  and  boils  at  277°.  It  dissolves 
unaltered  in  alcohol  and  ether;  in  boiling  water  it  is  slowly  converted 


654  DIBASIC   AROMATIC   ACIDS. 

into  phthalic  acid.  By  action  of  two  molecules  of  phosphoric  chloride 
on  phthalic  acid 

Phthalyl  chloride,  C8H402C12  =  C6H4(C0.C1)2,  is  obtained  as  a 
yellow  oil,  boiling  at  270°.  On  treatment  with  water  it  is  slowly  con- 
verted into  hydrochloric  and  phthalic  acids  ;  with  alcohols  it  yields 
ethereal  phthalates,  and  with  phenol  it  gives  phenyl  phthalate  : 

C6H4(CO.O.C6H5)2, 
forming  prisms  melting  at  61°  and  difficultly  soluble  in  cold  alcohol. 

Chlor-phthalic  acids  are  obtained  by  the  oxidation  of  chlor-naph- 
thalenes  with  dilute  nitric  acid.     Dichlor-phthalic  acid  : 

C6H2Cl2(CO.OH)2, 

prepared  from  dichlor-naphthalene  tetrachloride,  forms  yellow  prisms, 
melts  at  183°-185°,  and  is  moderately  soluble  in  water.  Tetrachlor- 
phthaUc  acid,  C6Cl4(CO.OH)2,  obtained  by  oxidation  of  pentachlor- 
naphthalene,  crystallises  in  leaves  and  tables,  and  melts  at  250°. 
On  heating  these  acids  decompose  into  water  and  chlor-anhydrides, 
in  the  latter  case  even  on  fusing. 

On  heating  phthalic  acid  with  nitro-sulphuric  acid,  nitro-phthalic 
acid,  C6H3(N02)(CO.OH)2,  is  obtained  in  the  form  of  yellow  prisms, 
melting  at  212°  and  moderately  soluble  in  water;  on  treatment  with 
tin  and  hydrochloric  acid,  carbonic  anhydride  is  eliminated  and  met- 
amido-benzoic  acid  formed. 

1108.  lhjdropld Italic  Acids. — Dihydrophthalic  acid  : 

C8H8O4  =  C6H6(C0.Oll)  . 

is  formed  by  the  long-continued  action  of  sodium  amalgam  on  a  cold 
solution  of  sodic  phthalate,  and  is  separated  on  addition  of  hydrochloric 
acid.  It  crystallises  in  plates  and  tables,  is  difficultly  soluble  in  cold 
water  and  ether,  readily  in  boiling  water  and  alcohol.  It  fuses  at 
200°  with  decomposition  into  hydrogen,  water,  and  phthalic  anhy- 
dride. Its  easy  convertibility  into  benzoic  acid  and  its  derivatives 
is  peculiar  to  it.  This  occurs  on  addition  of  bromine  to  an  aqueous 
solution  : 

C6H6(CO.OH)2  +  Br2  =  C6H5.CO.OH  +  C02  +  2HBr," 

or  on  oxidation  with  dilute  nitric  acid.  Phosphoric  chloride  convert > 
it  into  chlor-benzoyl  and  carbon  monoxide : 

C6H6(CO.OH)2  +  2PC1,5  =  C6H5.C0.C1  +  CO  +  2P0C13  +  3HC1. 

On  saturating  alcoholic  solutions  of  the  acid  with  hydrochloric  acid 
the  corresponding  ethereal  benzoates  are  formed. 

Tetrahydropltthalic  acid,  (,8H10O4  =  C6H8(CO.OH)2,  is  obtained 
by  dry  distillation  of  isohydropyromellitic  acid,  first  as  the  anhydride, 
C6H8(CO)20,  crystallising  in  plates  and  melting  at  86°,  which  on 
treatment  with  water  is  converted  into  the  acid.  This  crystallises  in 
plates,  melts  at  96°,  but  already  at  this  temperature  decomposes  into 
water  and  the  anhydride.  ILxaJnidrophthalic  acid,  C6H10(CO.OH)2, 
is  obtained  from  both  the  preceding  by  heating  at  230°  with  con- 
centrated hydriodic  acid,  and  also  from  tetrahvdrophthalic  acid  by 
treatment  with  sodium  amalgam.  It  melts  at  207°,  is  difficultly 
soluble  in  water,  and  crystallises  in  plates  or  prisms. 


ISO-   AND  TEBE-PHTHALIC  ACIDS.  fioo 

1109.  Iaopkthalic  acid,  or  metapAenylene  diearbomc  add,  (1:3), 
is  obtained  by  oxidation  of  metaxylene  and  metatoluic  acid  with 
chromic  and  sulphuric  acids,  by  fusion  of  potassic  metasulpho-benzoato 
with  potassic  formate,  and  finally  as  ethylic  salt  by  the  action  of 
et  hylic  chloro-carbonate  and  sodium  on  that  dibrom-benzene  which 
yields  three  isomeric  tri-derivatives  on  further  substitution,  and  which 
must  therefore  have  the  bromine  atoms  in  the  meta  position  : 

C6H4Br2  +  2C1.C0.C,H5  +  2Na,  =  2NaBr 
+  2NaCl  +  C6H4(CO.O.C2H.5)2. 

It  crystallises  in  hair-like  prisms,  difficultly  soluble  even  in  boiling 
water;  it  melts  above  300°  and  sublimes.  Its  salts  are  in  part  more 
readily  Boluble  than  those  of  phthalic  acid,  e.g.  baric  isophthalatc, 
C6H4(CO.O)aBa,3HaO. 

Phosphoric   pentachloride  converts    it   into    itopktkalie   chloride,

isophthali  0sHt(NO1)(CO.OH)tJ  forming  thin  plates,  melting 

at  248°  249  ,  and  reduced  by  tin  and  hydrochloric  acid  to  amido- 
iaophthalic  acid,  C6Ha(KH1)(CO.OH)s,  crystallising  in  difficultly 
soluble  plates,  melting  at  300°. 

1110.  TerephthaUc  acid,  or  parapA  rbonic  arid,  is 
formed  from  paradialkyl  benzenes,  paratoluic  acid,  cuminol,  cumic 
acid,  Ac,  by  oxidation  with  chromic  and  sulphuric  acids;  it  can  be 
obtained  from  that  dibrom-benzene  which  only  yields  a  single  tri- 
derivative  on  further  substitution  (and  in  which  therefore  the  bromine 
atoms  must  be  in  the  para  position)  by  treatment  with  sodium  and 
methylic  iodide,  when  paraxylene  is  obtained,  which  on  oxidation 
yields  terephthalic  acid.  Terephthalic  acid  can  also  be  obtained  from 
potassic  benzene-paradisulphonate.  This  on  dry  distillation  with 
potassic  cyanide  gives  paraphenylene  dicyanide,  C6H4(CN),,  and 
this  on  saponification  yields  a  salt  of  terephthalic  acid.  It  forms  a 
white  crystalline  powder,  nearly  insoluble  in  water,  alcohol,  and  ether, 
and  sublimes  without  previous  fusion  above  300°.  The  baric  salt, 
CfiH4(CO.O)2Ba,4H20,  is  very  difficultly  soluble.  The  methylic  and 
ethylic  salts  both  crystallise  in  prisms;  the  first  melts  at  144°,  the 
latter  at  44°. 

Terephthalyl  chloride,  C6H4(C0.C1)2,  prepared  by  aid  of  phos- 
phoric chloride,  melts  at  78°.  Phenylic  terephthalate  melts  at  191°, 
and  crystallises  in  needles  very  difficultly  soluble  in  boiling  water. 
Nitro-terephthalic  acid,  C6H3(]Sr02)(CO.OH)2,  obtained  by  boiling  te- 
rephthalic acid  with  concentrated  nitric  acid,  is  moderately  soluble  in 
water,  crystallises  in  cauliflower-like  masses,  and  melts  at  259°.

1113.  Only  one  of  the  three  isomeric  acids  of  this  formula 
(trimesic  acid)  can  be  obtained  by  the  oxidation  of  a  trimethyl 
benzene. 

1.  Trirnesic  acid,  (1 :3:5),  is  obtained  by  the  oxidation  of  inesity- 
lene,  mesitylenic  acid,  and  uvitic  acid  by  chromic  and  .sulphuric  acids, 
from  mellitic  acid  by  heating  with  glycerine  in  an  oil  bath  until  the 
whole  mass  has  become  solid  : 

C6(CO.OH)0  =  300,  +  C  \-H  ./CO.OH)3, 

and  together  with  the  tetrabasic  prehnitic  and  mellophanic  acids  from 
the  isomeric  hexahydromellitic  acids  by  heating  with  sulphuric  acid. 
It  crystallises  in  prisms,  melts  at  above  300%  can  be  sublimed,  is 
difficultly  soluble  in  cold  water,  and  gives  benzene  on  distillation  with 
excess  of  lime. 

2.  TrimeUiUc  acid,  (1:2:4).  Hydropyromellitic  acid,  on  heating 
with  concentrated  sulphuric  acid,  yields  isophthalic  and  trimellitic 
acids,  which  can  be  separated  by  aid  of  the  different  solubility  of  their 
baric  salts  (that  of  trimellitic  acid,  (C9H306)2Ba3,3H;iO,  being  very 
difficultly  soluble).  Trimellitic  acid  crystallises  in  warl  s,  is 
moderately  soluble  in  water  and  ether,  melts  at  216'%  and  on  long 
heating  at  this  temperature  is  converted  into  water  and  amhy

the  acid  is  obtained  in  colourless  prisms  of  the  formula 

C6H2(CO.OH)4,2H20.

It  dissolves  to  a  large  extent  in  hot  water  and  alcohol.  When  an- 
hydrous it  melts  at  240°  and  decomposes  again  into  water  and  pyro-

mellitic  anhydride,  C6H 2  <  ^     .     This  latter  melts  at  286°,  and  on 

[co'.° 

distillation  solidifies  to  a  mass  of  large  crystals.  Phosphoric  chloride 
converts  pyromellitic  acid  into  the  anhydrochloride  : 

°6±±2  \  (COCl)a 

and  the  chloride,  C6H2(C0C1)4,  both  crystalline  compounds.  Ethylic 
pyromellitate,  C6H2(CO.O.C2H5)4,  is  obtained  by  heating  argentic 
pyromellitate  with  ethylic  iodide  at  100°,  crystallises  from  alcohol  in 
short,  flat  needles,  melting  at  53°. 

By  the  action  of  sodium  amalgam,  continued  for  several  weeks,  on 
pyromellitic  acid,  two  isomeric  tetrahydro- pyromellitic  acids  : 

C10H10O8  =  C6H6(CO.OH)4, 

are  obtained — hydro-pyromellitic  acid,  which  is  amorphous,  and  iso- 
hydro-pyromellitic  acid — crystallising  with  two  molecules  of  water  in 
grouped  needles.  It  loses  its  water  of  crystallisation  at  120°,  and 
melts  above  200°  with  decomposition  into  carbonic  anhydride,  water, 
and  tetrahydro-phthalic  anhydride.  On  heating  with  concentrated 
sulphuric  acid  it  is  in  part  converted  into  pyromellitic  anhydride  : 

C6H6(CO.OH)4  +  2H2S04  =  2S02  +  6H20  +  C6H2|  j£j°)»° 

and  partly  into  carbonic  anhydride,  trimellitic  acid,  and  isophthalic 
acid. 

On  heating  hydromellitic  acid  with  five  times  its  weight  of  con- 
centrated sulphuric  acid  in  a  retort,  until  one-half  of  the  sulphuric 
acid  has  distilled,  the  hydromellitic  acid  is  decomposed,  with  evolution 
of  carbonic  and  sulphurous  anhydrides  and  water,  into  trimesic  acid, 
prehnomalic  acid,  and  both  the  tetrabasic  acids,  prehnitic  and  mello- 
phanic  acids,  both  of  which  are  readily  soluble  in  water,  and  may  be 
separated  in  the  form  of  their  baric  salts,  of  which  that  of  prehnitic 
acid  is  difficultly  soluble. 

2.  Prehnitic  acid,  (1:2:3:5),  crystallises  in  large  prisms  united 
in  groups,  of  the  formula  C10H6O8,2H2O.  When  anhydrous  it  melts 
at  240°  and  decomposes  into  water  and  anhydro-prehnitic  acid : 

p  H    f  (CO)20 
b6±l2l(CO.OH)2 

By  long-continued  action  of  sodium  amalgam  on  its  aqueous  solution 
prehnitic  acid  is  converted  into  hydroprehnitic  acid,  C6H6(CO.OH)4 ; 
on  heating  with  strong  sulphuric  acid  this  decomposes  into  prehnitic 
acid,  carbonic  anhydride,  and  isophthalic  acid. 

3.  Mellophanic  acid  forms  anhydrous  crystalline  crusts,  melts 
between  215°  and  238°,  and  yields  a  hydro-acid  on  treatment  with 
nascent  hydrogen. 


MELLITIC  ACID.  659 

Hexabasic  Acid,  C12H60,2  =  CG(CO.OH)G. 

1115.  Mellitic  acid  occurs  as  aluminic  salt  in  mellite  or  honey- 
stone,  a  rare  mineral  crystallising  in  yellow  quadratic  pyramids  and 
occurring  in  lignite.  On  boiling  ,niellite  with  ammonic  carbonate 
alumina  separates,  and  on  evaporation  the  solution  yields  large 
rhombic  prisms  of  amnionic  mellitate,  C6(CO.O.NH4)6,9H20,  which 
by  precipitation  with  baric  chloride  are  converted  into  the  difficultly 
soluble  crystalline  baric  salt  C6[(CO.O)2Ba]3,3H20.  By  decomposi- 
tion of  this  latter  with  the  requisite  quantity  of  sulphuric  acid 
mellitic  acid  is  obtained  in  the  free  state. 

It  crystallises  in  fine  silky  needles,  readily  soluble  in  water  and 
alcohol.     On  heating  alone  it  yields  pyromellitic  anhydride  : 

C6(CO.OH)6  =  2C02  +  2H20  +  C6H2[(CO)20]2. 

Heated  with  glycerine  it  gives  trimesic  acid  : 

C6(C0.0H)6  =  3C02  +  C6H3(CO.OH)3; 

and  distilled  with  excess  of  lime  it  yields  benzene : 

C6(CO.OH)6  +  6CaO  =  6CaC03  +  C6H6. 

Nitric  acid,  hydriodic  acid,  and  bromine  do  not  alter  it  even  at 
high  temperatures. 

It  has  been  prepared  artificially  by  the  oxidation  of  pure  wood 
charcoal  with  an  alkaline  solution  of  potassic  permanganate. 

Ammonic  mellitate  decomposes  at  160°  into  ammonia  water, 
ammonic  euchroate,  and  mellimide. 

Ammonic  euchroate  is  formed  according  to  the  equation  : 

C6(CO.O.NH4)6  =  2NH3  +  4H20  +  cJ  Vc0-       V* 

t(CO.O.NH4)2 

On  acidulating  its  aqueous  solution  euchroic  acid,  C12N2H408, 
separates  in  short  colourless  prisms,  difficultly  soluble  in  cold  water. 
The  aqueous  solution,  on  treatment  with  nascent  hydrogen,  gives  an 
insoluble  deep  blue  precipitate,  euchrone,  which  again  oxidises  to 
euchroic  acid  on  exposure  to  air. 

Mellimide,  or  paramide,  is  formed  according  to  the  equation  : 

C6(CO.O.NH4)6  =  3NH3  +  6H20  +  C6[^;Nh], 

It  is  a  white  amorphous  mass,  insoluble  in  water  and  alcohol ;  on 
heating  with  water  at  200°  it  is  converted  into  acid  ammonic 
mellitate. 

Long-continued  action  of  sodium  amalgam  on  aqueous  ammonic 
mellitate  converts  it  into  sodic  hydromellitate.  The  solution  gives  with 
plumbic  acetate  a  precipitate  of  plumbic  mellitate,  which  on  decom- 
position with  sulphuretted  hydrogen  yields  hydromellitic  acid : 

C6H6(CO.OH)6. 

It  remains  on  evaporation  as  an  indistinctly  crystalline  mass.  On 
keeping,  or  rapidly  on  heating  at  180°,  it  is  converted  into  the  isomeric

isohydromellitic  acid,  forming  hard  tetragonal  prisms,  soluble  in 
water,  but  insoluble  in  hydrochloric  acid.  Both  hydromellitic  acids, 
on  heating  with  sulphuric  acid,  yield  trimesic,  prehnitic,  and  mello- 
phanic  acids. 

Constitution  of  the  Tri-  and  Tetra-basic  Acids. 

1116.  According  to  the  benzene  theory  at  present  accepted  the 
acids  C6H3(CO.OH)3  and  C6H2(CO.OH)4  can  each  exist  in  three 
isomeric  modifications,  all  of  which  are  known. 

In  determining  their  constitution  the  formation  of  trimesic  acid 
from  mesitylene  leads  to  the  formula  :

of  which  the  (2)  =1:2:3  probably  belongs  to  hemimellitic  acid,  as  it 
decomposes  into  carbonic  anhydride,  water,  and  phthalic  anhydride  on 
heating,  leaving  (3)  =  1:2:4  for  trimellitic  acid,  which  on  heating 
yields  only  water  and  anhydromellitic  acid. 

With  regard  to  the  three  tetrabasic  acids  the  most  important 
evidence  is  given  by  the  formation  of  their  anhydrides.  As  in  the 
case  of  the  dibasic  acids,  only  the  ortho  compound,  phthalic  acid, 
gives  such  a  body,  it  is  probable  that  anhydride  formation  depends  on 
the  neighbouring  position  of  the  CO.OH  groups.  Two  of  the  tetra- 
basic acids,  namely

on  the  contrary,  would  only  yield  anhydro-acids,  thus  agreeing  with 
prehnitic  acid.  The  formula  (1)  or  (2)  cannot  as  yet  be  decidedly 
assigned  to  pyromellitic  and  mellophanic  acids  respectively,  but  the 


POLYBASIC  AKOMATIC  ACIDS.  661 

symmetrical  expression  (1)  probably  corresponds  to  pyromellitic  acid, 
as  that  is  obtained  directly  from  mellitic  acid. 

The  constitution  of  mellitic  acid  admits  of  no  doubt ;  the  formation 
of  two  isomeric  hexahydromellitic  acids  only  necessitates  the  view- 
that  the  hydromellitic  acid  first  formed,  (  Q  nr\  qtt  )  6>  during  its  con- 
version into  the  iso-acid  exchanges  hydrogen  atoms  and  CO.OH 
groups  in  such  a  way  that  some  of  the  carbon  atoms  of  the  benzene 
ring  are  in  union  with  two  CO.OH  groups,  and  as  many  others  united 
to  two  hydrogen  atoms. 


662 


FURTHER  SIMPLE  BENZENE  DERIVATIVES. 

1117.  There  are  still  some  groups  of  compounds  to  be  described  in 
addition  to  the  simple  benzene  derivatives  already  mentioned,  which 
essentially  stand  in  genetic  relation  to  the  latter,  i.e.  which  are  de- 
rived from  a  closed  ring  of  six  carbon  atoms.  The  constitution  of 
these  bodies  has,  however,  as  yet  not  been  made  out  with  sufficient 
clearness. 

Terpenes,  C10H16. 

1118.  The  hydrocarbons  of  the  formula  C10H16,  to  which  the 
general  name  of  terpenes  has  been  applied,,  occur  either  ready-formed 
in  the  essential  oils  of  plants  or  are  derived  from  these  natural 
terpenes  by  chemical  reactions.  They  are  known  in  numerous 
isomeric  modifications,  in  a  large  part  of  which  the  isomerism  appears 
to  be  only  physical  (§  47) ;  polymeric  modifications  are  also  known. 
Those  best  investigated  stand  in  near  relation  to  cymene,  C10H14 
(§  1023),  into  which  they  can  be  converted  in  various  ways — for 
instance,  by  heating  with  iodine,  when  hydrogen  is  eliminated.    They 

are  therefore  dihydro-cymenes,  C6H6r<  t|  ,  one  of  the  double  carbon 

.o3ri7 

unions  in  the  benzene  nucleus  having  been  converted  into  monovalent, 

the  other  two  double  unions  still  remaining  unchanged.     This  theory 

of  the  constitution  of  the  terpenes   agrees    with  their   union   with 

halogens,  hydro-acids,  water,    <fec,  to  form   additive  products,  from 

which    either   cymenes   or   the   terpenes   themselves   can   be   again 

obtained. 

The  boiling  points  of  the   terpenes  lie  between  155°  and  175°, 

their  sp.  gr.  between  *85  and  *88.   Many  of  them  can  be  distinguished 

by   their  power  of  rotating  a  beam  of  polarised  light  in   different 

directions,  whilst  others  are  quite  inactive. 

Oil  of  Turpentine. 

1119.  Turpentine,  a  viscous  liquid  which  flows  from  incisions 
made  in  the  bark  of  vai-ious  conifera?  (especially  from  Pinus,  Abies, 
and  Larix),  is  a  solution  of  a  resin  in  oil  of  turpentine.  On  distilling 
turpentine  with  water,  the  oil  passes  over,  whilst  the  resin  remains 
behind  and  on  fusion  is  obtained  in  the  form  of  colophony. 

The  turpentine  oils  floating  on  the  top  of  the  aqueous  distillate 
possess  different  optical  rotary  powers,  according  to  the  source  from 
whence  obtained.  Most — for  instance,  that  obtained  from  Finns 
maritima  (French  oil  of  turpentine) — are  lsevorotary  ;  that  from  Pinus 
austraUs  (English  turpentine  oil)  is  dextrorotary. 


OIL  OF  TUKPENTINE.  663 

Oil  of  turpentine  occurring  in  commerce  is  invariably  impure,  as 
when  exposed  to  light  it  readily  absorbs  atmospheric  oxygen,  being 
converted  into  resin.  In  order  to  purify  it  it  is  first  shaken  with 
solutions  of  alkaline  carbonates,  in  order  to  remove  free  acids  (espe- 
cially formic  and  acetic  acids),  and  is  then  purified  by  distillation  in 
vacuo. 

The  pure  turpentine  oils  so  obtained — terebenthene,  from  Pinus 
maritima,  and  australene,  from  Pinus  australis — are  mobile,  colourless 
liquids  of  peculiar  odour;  they  boil  at  156°,  have  sp.  gr.  *864  at  15° 
and  a  vapour  density  of  4' 698.  They  are  nearly  insoluble  in  water, 
but  impart  their  odour  when  shaken  with  it ;  they  mix  in  every  pro- 
portion with  alcohol,  ether,  and  acetic  acid.  They  burn  with  a  strongly 
smoky  luminous  flame,  and  are  good  solvents  for  sulphur,  phosphorus, 
fats,  resins,  and  many  other  bodies  insoluble  in  water.  Repeated  dis- 
tillation at  ordinary  atmospheric  pressure  converts  them  into  isomeric 
and  polymeric  modifications  of  higher  boiling  points.  This  change 
occurs  more  quickly  on  heating  at  250°  in  closed  vessels.  One  of 
the  polymers,  metaterebenthene,  boils  at  360°  and  has  the  formula 
C2oH32. 

On  repeatedly  distilling  terebenthene  with  small  quantities  of 
concentrated  sulphuric  acid  until  a  distillate  is  obtained  which  is  com- 
pletely optically  inactive,  terebene  is  obtained  ;  it  is  a  liquid  of  thyme- 
kke  odour,  boils  at  156°,  and  unites  with  two  atoms  of  bromine,  and 
on  then  boiling  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  yields  cymene  : 

C10H16Br2  +  2KOH  =  2KBr  +  2H20  +  C10H14. 

By  oxidation  with  warm  nitric  acid  terebenthene  is  converted  into 
terebic  acid  (§  867),  and,  on  passing  its  vapours  over  soda  lime  heated 

f  CH 

to  400°,  into  terebentilic  acid,  C8H10O2  =  C6H6  <  ^q  qtx    (?) ;  this 

latter  crystallises  in  small  white  needles,  melts  at  90°,  and  boils  at 
250°. 

1120.  Compounds  ivith  One  Molecule  of  Hydrochloric  Acid. — The 
turpentine  oils  absorb  large  quantities  of  hydrochloric  acid  gas, 
forming  with  it  two  isomeric  compounds  of  the  formula  C10H,7C1. 
If  the  temperature  is  kept  as  low  as  possible,  a  crystalline  body  is 
chiefly  formed ;  at  higher  temperatures  a  liquid  addition  product  is 
mainly  obtained.  They  are  separated  by  solution  in  hot  alcohol.  On 
cooling  the  first  separates  in  colourless  needles  of  camphoraceous 
odour  (artificial  camphor).  It  is  insoluble  in  water,  melts  at  115°  (or 
in  an  atmosphere  of  hydrochloric  acid  gas,  with  special  precautions  to 
prevent  decomposition,  at  131°-132°),  and  can  be  sublimed  on  careful 
heating. 

1121.  Camphenes. — Both  the  isomeric  hydrochlorides,  on  heating 
with  basic  hydrates  or  alkali  salts  of  weak  acids,  are  re- converted 
into  hydrocarbons  of  the  original  formula,  but  which  show  altered 
properties.  The  crystalline  hydrochlorides,  on  heating  with  dry  soap 
at  220°,  give  solid  camphenes,  melting  at  45°  and  boiling  at  160° 
(terecamphene  being  laevorotary  and  austracamphene  dextrorotary). 
By  decomposition  with  sodic  benzoate  both  hydrochlorides  yield 
optically  inactive  camphene,  which  also  melts  at  45°  and  boils  at  160°. 
All  three  camphenes  unite  directly  with  a  molecule  of  hydrochloric 


664  TEKPENES. 

acid,  forming  solid  hydrochlorides.  By  decomposition  with  lime 
heated  to  200°  these  yield  a  liquid  inactive  terpene,  camphilene,  boil- 
ing at  160°,  which  also  yields  a  solid  compound,  C10H17C1,  with  hydro- 
chloric acid. 

"  The  original  liquid  hydrochlorides,  on  the  other  hand,  are  converted 
by  heated  lime  into  a  liquid,  terebilene,  which  is  optically  inactive, 
and  forms  a  liquid  hydrochloride,  C10H17C1. 

Terebene  (§  1119)  yields  a  solid  hydrochloride,  which  melts  in  an 
atmosphere  of  hydrochloric  acid  at  125°  and,  unlike  its  isomers,  is 
quickly  decomposed  by  water  into  hydrochloric  acid  and  solid 
camphene. 

1122.  Compounds  with  Two  Molecules  of  Hydrochloric  Acid. — On 
long  contact  of  turpentine  oils  with  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid,  or 
by  saturation  of  their  solutions  in  alcohol,  ether,  and  acetic  acid  with 
hydrochloric  acid  gas,  rhombic  crystals  are  formed  of  the  dihydro- 
chlorides,  C10H18C]2 ;  they  are  insoluble  in  water,  but  on  long  boiling 
with  it  yield  terpinol,  C2oH340. 

1123.  Terpine. — Colourless  crystals  of  terpine  hydrate  separate 
after  a  time  from  oil  of  turpentine  containing  water  : 

C10H22O3  =  C10H20O2,H2O. 

These  are  obtained  in  quantity  when  eight  parts  of  oil  of  turpentine, 
two  parts  of  dilute  nitric  acid,  and  one  part  of  alcohol  are  allowed  to 
react  on  one  another  for  some  time,  the  mixture  being  frequently 
shaken.  Terpine  hydrate  forms  large,  brilliant,  colourless,  short 
rhombic  prisms,  and  can  be  crystallised  from  alcohol,  ether,  and  hot 
water.  In  an  exsiccator  it  loses  a  molecule  of  water  and  is  converted 
into  terpine,  C10H20O2,  which  melts  at  103°  and  sublimes  at  higher 
temperatures  in  long  needles.  Hydrochloric  acid  and  phosphoric 
chloride  convert  it  into  the  above-mentioned  dihydrocMoride  :

On  long  heating  of  its  aqueous  solution  with  some  hydrochloric  and 
sulphuric  acids  it  yields  terpinol,  C2oH340.  This  latter  is  a  liquid  of 
hyacinth-like  odour ;  it  boils  at  168°  and  has  sp.  gr.  '852.  Hydro- 
chloric acid  reconverts  it  into  C10H18C12. 

The  relations  of  these  bodies  to  one  another  are  shown  in  the

boils  at  173°  and  has  sp.  gr.  -85  at  15°.  Hydrochloric  acid  readily 
converts  it  into  citrene  dihydrocMoride,  C10H18C12,  melting  at  44°;

water  converts  it  into  the  crystalline  citrene  terpine,  C,0H20O2;  and 
with  bromine  it  yields  a  dibromide,  C10H'16Br2,  which  with  aniline  at 
190°  gives  aniline  hydrobromide  and  cymene.  The  ethereal  oils  from 
other  aurantiacese,  such  as  oil  of  bergamot,  &c.,  are  very  similar  to 
oil  of  lemons. 

The  greater  number  of  ethereal  oils,  which  are  obtained  by  distil- 
lation of  odoriferous  plants  with  water,  are  mixtures  of  terpenes  with 
other  volatile  substances.  When  these  admixtures  are  solid  they  crys- 
tallise out  in  the  cold  and  are  termed  stearoptenes.  A  large  number 
of  these  oils  have  been  previously  mentioned  ;  e.g.  oil  of  rue  (§  455), 
Roman  chamomile  oil  (§  797,  2),  oil  of  anise  (§  1100),  winter  green 
oil  (§  1061,  1),  oil  of  spire*  (§  1033),  oil  of  thyme  (§  1023),  oil  of 
cinnamon  (§  1092),  oil  of  cloves  (§  1101),  &c. 

Camphors. 

1125.  The  camphors  stand  in  very  close  relation  to  cymene  and 
to  the  terpenes  \  they  are  obtained,  mostly  with  terpenes,  by  distilla- 
tion of  different  plants  with  water. 

The  most  important  varieties,  borneol,  C10H18O,  and  laurinol, 
C10H16O,  stand  to  one  another  in  the  relation  of  a  secondary  alcohol 
to  its  ketone.     Menthol,  C10H20O,  is  a  similar  alcohol-like  substance. 

1126.  Borneol,  or  Borneo  camphor,  C10H17.OH,  occurs  together 
with  borneene,  a  terpene,  in  Dryobalanops  Camphora,  growing  in 
Borneo  and  Sumatra.  It  can  be  obtained  from  ordinary  camphor  by 
heating  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  : 

2C10H16O  +  KOBE  +  HO.C2H5  =  rfc10H18O  +  KO.C2H30, 

together  with  campholic  acid  (§  1129),  similarly,  together  with  cam- 
phor-carbonic acid,  by  treatment  of  laurinol  with  sodium  and  carbonic 
anhydride. 

Borneol  forms  brittle  crystals,  possessing  at  once  a  camphor-  and 
peppermint-like  odour;  it  melts  at  198°  and  boils  at  212°.  The 
alcoholic  solution  rotates  the  plane  of  polarisation  to  the  right 
([a]D  =  +  32*7°).  On  oxidation  with  nitric  acid  it  yields  laurinol,  or 
on  further  action  camphoric  acid ;  by  heating  with  phosphoric  anhy- 
dride it  is  resolved  into  water  and  borneene,  boiling  at  176°-180°  : 

C10H18O  +  PA  =  2HP03  +  C10H16. 

On  heating  with  organic  acids  at  200°  borneol  yields  salts. 
Borneol  stearate,  C10H17.O.C18H35O,  is  a  viscous  oil  which  slowly 
crystallises.  Concentrated  hydrochloric  acid,  and  still  more  readily 
phosphoric  chloride,  convert  borneol  into  borneyl  chloride,  C10H17C1,. 
which  resembles  the  isomeric  terebenthene  hydrochloride  very  closely, 
but  melts  at  159°  and  decomposes  at  a  little  higher  temperature. 

An  optically  Icevorotary  borneol  occurs  in  the  fusel  oil  from  the 
spirit  prepared  from  the  fermentation  of  madder  roots ;  other  isomeric 
compounds  exist  in  oil  of  hops,  oil  of  cajeput,  oil  of  coriander  seed, 
&c. 

A  compound  homologous  to  borneol  is  contained  in  oil  of  pat- 
chouli; this  patchouli  camphor,  C15H280,  is  crystalline,  melts  at 
54°-55°,  and  boils  at  296°. 


666  CAMPHORS. 

1127.  Laurinol,  more  commonly  termed  camphor,  is  obtained 
from  all  parts  (especially  from  the  wood)  of  Laurus  Camphora ;  it  is 
purified  by  sublimation.  It  can  be  prepared  by  the  oxidation  of  oil 
of  valerian  and  oil  of  sage  or  borneol  with  nitric  acid. 

Camphor  occurs  in  commerce  in  transparent  tough  masses  of 
peculiar  smell  and  taste.  It  forms  large  brilliant  crystals  on  slow 
sublimation  (even  at  ordinary  temperatures)  and  on  evaporation  of  its 
alcoholic  solution.  Its  sp.  gr.  is  -985,  the  vapour  density  5*32 ;  it 
melts  at  175°  and  boils  at  205°.  It  is  very  little  soluble  in  water, 
readily  soluble  in  alcohol,  ether,  and  oils.  Its  alcoholic  solution  is 
strongly*  dextrorotary. 

Aqueous  hypochlorous  acid  converts  camphor  into  monochlor- 
camphor,  C]0H15ClO,  a  crystalline  mass,  melting  at  95°,  readily 
soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether;  on  heating  with  alcoholic  potassic 
hydrate  this  yields  oxycamphor,  C10H16O2  =  C10H15(OH)O,  forming 
colourless  needles.     It  melts  at  137°  and  can  be  sublimed. 

A  saturated  solution  of  camphor  in  chloroform,  on  treatment  with 
bromine,  yields  a  crystalline  camphor  dibromide,  C10H16OBr2,  which 
readily  decomposes  into  hydrobromic  acid  and  monobrom-camphor. 
This  latter  forms  colourless  prisms,  melts  at  76°,  and  boils  at  274°  •  it 
is  also  formed,  together  with  dibroin-camphor,  C10H14Br2O  (prisms 
melting  at  114"5°),  by  heating  camphor  and  bromine  at  120°. 

Sodium  dissolves  readily  in  a  solution  of  camphor  in  toluene,  much 
heat  being  evolved  and  sod-camphor  and  borneol  being  formed  : 

3C10H16O  +  Na2  =  2C10H15NaO  +  C10H18O. 

Sod-camphor  unites  directly  with  carbonic  anhydride,  forming  sodic 
campho -carbonate : 

C10H15ONa  +  C02  =  C10H15O.CO.ONa, 

from  whose  aqueous  solution  hydrochloric  acid  separates  campho- 
carbonic  acid  in  small  difficultly  soluble  crystals;  it  melts  at  118°- 
119°,  with  decomposition  into  carbonic  anhydride  and  camphor. 

1128.  Matricaria  camphor  is  obtained  from  the  oil  of  feverfew 
(Matricaria  Parthenium)  by  strongly  cooling  that  portion  which 
distils  between  200°  and  220°.  It  is  isomeric  with  laurinol,  and  re- 
sembles it  in  all  but  its  optical  properties,  this  body  being  laevorotary. 
This  difference  in  rotary  power  runs  through  all  the  derivatives  of 
these  bodies,  though  in  all  other  respects  they  are  closely  analogous. 

Both  camphors  are  acted  on  by  phosphoric  chloride,  being  first 
converted  into  crystalline  dichloride,  C10H16C12,  but  partly  further, 
with  elimination  of  hydrochloric  acid,  into  solid,  C10H15C1  (comp.  § 
445).  This  latter  on  heating  again  loses  hydrochloric  acid  and  is  con- 
verted into  cymene. 

On  distillation  with  zincic  chloride,  phosphoric  anhydride,  or  phos- 
phoric sulphide,  camphor  yields  cymene  in  addition  to  xylene  and 
toluene  j  thiocymophenol  also  in  the  last  case,  whilst  heating  with 
J  of  its  weight  of  iodine,  converts  it  into  cymophenol  (§  1023). 

Two  isomers  of  camphor  exist  in  the  oil  of  wormwood,  obtained 
from  Artemisia  Absinthium  when  in  flower,  absinthol,  boiling  at 
195°,  and  myristicol,  boiling  at  212°-218°  ;  they  both  yield  cymene 
on  distillation  with  zincic  chloride  or  phosphoric  sulphide. 


CAMPHOEIC  ACID.  667 

Acids  from  Camphor. 

1129.  By  the  action  of  strong  basic  hydrates  on  camphor,  whether 
effected  by  passing  camphor  vapour  over  heated  soda  lime  or  by 
boiling  for  a  long  time  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate,  borneol  and 
campholates  are  formed  : 

C10H16O  +  HOK  =  C10H17O.OK, 

from  whose  aqueous  solution  addition  of  acids  separates  campholic 
acid,  C10H18O2.  It  is  nearly  insoluble  in  water,  crystallises  from 
alcohol  in  colourless  prisms  or  plates,  melts  at  95°,  and  can  be  sublimed. 
On  distillation  of  its  calcic  salt  with  soda  lime,  or  on  heating  the  acid 
with  phosphoric  anhydride,  it  is  converted  into  campholene,  C9H16, 
an  oil  boiling  at  135°. 

Nitric  acid  dissolves  camphor  in  the  cold  without  alteration,  but 
on  heating  vigorous  oxidation  ensues,  which  is  only  completed  after 
boiling  for  several  days  (150  grams  camphor  being  heated  with  two 
litres  of  nitric  acid  of  sp.  gr.  1*37).  On  evaporating  the  liquid  much 
camphoric  acid  separates  in  the  crystalline  form,  and  a  syrupy  mother 
liquor  is  left,  from  which  camphoronic  acid,  a  product  of  the  further 
oxidation  of  camphoronic  acid,  can  be  obtained. 

1130.  Camphoric  acid,  O10H16O4  =  C8H14(CO.OH)2,  probably  a 
homologue  of  fumaric  and  the  pyrocitric  acids  (§§  896-7),  crystallises 
from  a  hot  saturated  aqueous  solution  in  shining  colourless  plates, 
melts  at  178°,  and  decomposes  at  slightly  higher  temperature  into 
water  and  camphoric  anhydride,  C10H14O3  =  C8H14(CO)20 ;  this 
latter  sublimes  in  long  shining  prisms  and  melts  at  217°. 

Camphoric  acid  is  dibasic,  and  yields  acid  and  normal  salts.  Calcic 
camphorate,  C10H14CaO4,8H2O,  is  readily  soluble  in  water  and  de- 
composes at  higher  temperatures  into  calcic  carbonate  and  phorone 
(§  444) : 

C10H14CaO4  =  CaC03  +  C9H140. 

When  prepared  from  ordinary  camphor,  camphoric  acid  in 
alcoholic  solution  rotates  the  plane  of  polarisation  of  light  to  the 
right  ([a]  =  -f  38°-39°) ;  that  prepared  from  matricaria  camphor  is 
lsevorotary  to  exactly  the  same  extent,  though  otherwise  of  similar 
properties.  These  two  modifications  behave  to  one  another  like  tar- 
taric and  antitartaric  acid,  combining  in  equal  molecules  to  form  an 
inactive  camphoric  acid  corresponding  to  racemic  acid  (comp.  §  907). 
Long  heating  at  150°  with  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid  converts 
dextrorotary  camphoric  acid  into  a  second  inactive  modification, 
mesocamphoric  acid.  This  crystallises  in  interlaced  needles,  melts 
at  1 1 3°,  and  is  soluble  in  water. 

1131.  Camphoronic  acid,  C9H1205,  is  formed  by  the  further 
action  of  nitric  acid  on  camphoric  acid,  and  occurs  in  the  syrupy 
mother  liquor  from  which  this  has  been  crystallised ;  this  mother 
liquor  is  neutralised  with  ammonia,  heated  to  boiling,  and  baric 
chloride  added,  when  baric  camphornate,  (C9H905)2Ba3,2H20,  is  pre- 
cipitated, which  yields  camphoronic  acid  when  decomposed  by  dilute 
sulphuric  acid.  Camphoronic  acid,  C9H1205,H20,  crystallises  in  small 
needles,  loses  its  water  of  crystallisation  at  110°,  and  melts  at  115°  ;  it 


668 


CAMPHORS. 


sublimes  unchanged  at  higher  temperatures ;  on  fusion  with  alkalies 
it  yields  butyric  acid.     It  is  a  tribasic  acid. 

1132.  Menthol,  the  stearoptene  of  peppermint  oils,  is  usually  con- 
sidered as  belonging  to  the  camphors.  It  contains  two  atoms  of 
hydrogen  more  than  borneol,  having  the  formula  : 

CioH200  =  O10H19OH. 

It  crystallises  in  prisms,  has  a  peppermint-like  odour,  melts  at  42°, 
and  boils  at  212°.  It  behaves  like  a  monhydric  alcohol,  forming  salts 
with  acids.  When  treated  with  hydrochloric  acid  or  phosphoric  chloride 
it  yields  menthyl  chloride,  C10H19C1,  and  with  phosphoric  anhydride 
it  gives  menthene,  C10H18,  an  oil  boiling  at  163°. 

The  constitution  of  the  terpenes  and  camphors  is  still  far  from 
settled.  The  following  formulae  have  been  suggested,  but,  especially  in 
the  case  of  the  camphors  and  their  derivatives,  must  be  accepted  with 
great  reserve :

Indigo   Geoup. 

1133.  Many  species  of  plants,  especially  the  subtropical  and 
tropical  indigoferce,  Isatis  tinctoria,  Polygonum  tinctorium,  &c,  and 
at  times  also  the  urine  of  man  and  mammalia,  contain  a  substance 
(probably  of  glucoside  nature)  which  by  ferment-like  decompositions, 
or  by  boiling  with  dilute  acids,  yields  indigo  blue. 

This  chromogen  has  been  prepared  from  Isatis  tinctoria  (woad) 
and  termed  indican.  For  this  purpose  the  dried  plant  is  extracted 
with  alcohol,  the  filtered  liquid  evaporated  at  ordinary  temperatures, 
the  residue  dissolved  in  water  and  shaken  with  cupric  hydrate ;  it  is 
then  filtered,  the  nitrate  treated  with  sulphuretted  hydrogen  to  re- 
move copper,  and  the  clear  solution  evaporated  over  sulphuric  acid. 

Indican  is  a  clear  brown  syrup  of  bitter  and  nauseous  taste  ;  it  is 
decomposed  by  boiling  with  dilute  sulphuric  acid  into  indiylucin  : 

C6H10O6  (?), 


INDIGO.  669 

and  indigo  blue,  which  precipitates.  Indiglucin  is  also  a  syrup  of 
faintly  sweet  taste ;  it  reduces  Fehling's  solution  (§  870),  but  will 
not  enter  into  alcoholic  fermentation  with  yeast. 

In  order  to  prepare  indigo  on  the  large  scale,  the  leaves  and  stems 
of  the  respective  plants  are  covered  with  water  and  allowed  to  ferment. 
The  liquid  is  then  poured  into  shallow  vessels  and  exposed  to  the  air, 
when,  in  consequence  of  the  oxidation  of  the  indigo  white  first  formed, 
it  deposits  the  blue  colouring  matter.  This  latter  is  washed  and  dried, 
and  then  constitutes  commercial  indigo. 

This  is  by  no  means  pure  indigo  blue ;  it  yields  indigo  gluten  to 
dilute  acetic  acid,  indigo  brown  to  potassic  hydrate  solution,  and  finally 
indigo  red  to  boiling  alcohol.  The  residue  then  consists  of  indigo  blue 
mixed  with  insoluble  impurities. 

1134.  Indigo  blue,  or  indigotine,  C16H10!N"2O2,  is  obtained  syn- 
thetically by  heating  a  mixture  of  isatine  with  phosphorous  trichloride, 
phosphorus,  and  chlor-acetyl  in  sealed  tubes  at  70°-80°  for  several 
hours ;  when  the  reaction  product  is  poured  into  water,  on  exposure  to 
air,  blue  flocks  separate.  It  is  also  obtained  by  the  reduction  of 
isatine  chloride,  and  very  readily  by  treatment  of  potassic  indoxyl 
sulphonate  with  ferric  chloride  and  sulphuric  acid. 

A  still  more  important  method  of  synthesis  is  effected  as  follows  : 
Cinnamic  acid  is  converted  into  orthonitro-cinnamic  acid ;  this  is  then 
brominated  and  treated  with  potassic  hydrate,  whereby  it  is  converted 
into  nitro-phenyl  propiolic  acid  (comp.  §  1101),  which  latter  on  re- 
duction (best  by  glucose  in  alkaline  solution)  yields  indigo  blue  : 

2C9H5(N02)02  +  2H2  =  C16H10]Sr2O2  +  2H20  +  2C02. 

The  commercial  indigo  blue  can  be  purified  by  reducing  it  to 
indigo  white,  which  yields  metallic  compounds  with  the  alkalies  or 
alkaline  earths  which  are  soluble  in  water.  The  reducing  agents 
generally  employed  are  ferrous  salts,  grape  sugar,  or  putrefying 
organic  matter ;  e.g.  3  parts  indigo  with  6  parts  quick  lime,  400-500 
parts  water,  and  4  parts  ferrous  sulphate,  or  equal  parts  of  indigo 
and  grape  sugar  with  1^  part  concentrated  sodic  hydrate  solution. 
The  resulting  yellow  solution  of  the  indigo- white  metallic  compound, 
on  exposure  to  air,  deposits  indigo  blue  in  small  crystals. 

Pure  indigotine  can  also  be  obtained  in  well-formed  crystals  by 
treating  commercial  indigo  with  boiling  aniline  and  slowly  cooling  the 
filtered  liquid. 

Indigotine  is  a  deep  blue  substance  with  metallic  copper-red  reflex 
from  the  crystal  faces.  It  is  quite  insoluble  in  water,  alcohol,  ether, 
mineral  acids,  and  alkalies.  At  about  300°  it  forms  a  beautiful 
purple  red  vapour,  which  condenses  again  to  copper-coloured  prisms 
of  pure  indigotine. 

On  boiling  indigo  blue  with  solution  of  potassic  hydrate  and  man- 
ganic oxide  it  is  converted  into  orthamido-benzoic  acid  (§  1056), 
whilst  by  dry  distillation  with  solid  potassic  hydrate  it  yields 
aniline. 

1135.  The  reduction  to  indigo  white  in  presence  of  strong  bases 
has  been  already  mentioned.  From  the  alkaline  liquid  indigo  ivhite, 
C16H12N202,  can  be  separated  by  over- saturating  with  hydrochloric 
acid ;  air  being  excluded,  the  precipitated  white  flocks,  which  slowly

unite  to  crystalline  scales,  being  washed  with  air-free  water  and  dried 
in  vacuo.  It  is  obtained  in  this  way  a>  a  shimmering  powder,  dis- 
solving in  alcohol,  ether,  alkalies,  and  lime,  or  baryta  water,  with 
yellow  colour.  When  moist  it  oxidises  with  great  rapidity  to  indigo 
blue  : 

C16HI2N202  +  0=  H20  +  C16H10N2O2. 

1136.  By  digestion  of  indigotin  with  concentrated  sulphuric  acid, 
or  with  weak  Nordhausen  sulphuric  acid,  two  indigotin  sulphonic 
acids  are  formed  -indigotin  monosulphonic  acid,  or  phcenicin  sul- 
phuric acid,  C,6H9(S02.OH)N202,  and  ncid, 

98(S<  '  '  'I  I  X202.  The  latter  alone  is 
formed  when  1  part  <»f  indigo  is  heated  with  15  parts  of  sulphuric 
acid  for  three  days  at  40°-50°,  whilst  a  mixture  of  both  is  obtained 
if  only  8  parts  of  sulphuric  acid  be  employed* 

Phcentcin  BtUpkuri  ing  insoluble  in  dilute  acids,  separates 

bine  powder  on  dilution  of  tin-  reaction  product  with  water.     It

metals;  e.g.  C  .11  (S02.OK  NgOf,  which  is  precipitated  in  purple

Sulphindigotic  acid  on  oxidation  yields  isatine  salphonic  acid:

1138.  Reduction  Products  of  Isatine. — Isatine  combines  wits 
nascent  hydrogen,  evolved  from  zinc  and  hydrochloric  acid,  forming 

■  ide>  C16H12N204,  which  separates  as  a  white  crystalline  powder, 
difficultly  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether,  insoluble  in  water.  Isatine 
suffers  the  same  change  (which  resembles  the  formation  of  indigo 
white  from  indigo)  on  long  contact  with  amnionic  sulphide. 

On  passing  sulphuretted  hydrogen  into  an  alcoholic  solution  of 
isatine,  sulphur  and  isatyde  are  precipitated,  whilst  sulphisatyde  : 

C16H12M\202S2, 


672  INDIGO   GROUP. 

remains  dissolved  and  is  precipitated  by  addition  of  water  as  a  greyish 
yellow  powder  : 

2C8H5]Sr02  +  3H2S  =  S  +  2H20  +  C16H12N202S2. 

On  rubbing  together  sulphisatyde  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate, 
and  washing  the  rose-coloured  mass  with  water,  a  residue  is  obtained 
of  indine,  C16H10N2O2,  isomeric  with  indigotine  : 

C16H12N202S2  +  2KOH=  C16H10N2O2  +  2H20  +  K2S2. 

It  forms  a  fine  red  powder,  which  dissolves  on  heating  with  excess  of 
alcoholic  solution  of  potassic  hydrate,  and  on  cooling  gives  black 
crystals  of  potassium  indine,  C16H9KN202. 

1139.  Another  series  of  reduction  products  are  formed  by  the 
action  of  sodium  amalgam  on  aqueous  solutions  of  alkaline  isatates. 
On  evaporating  the  liquid  brilliant  crystals  of  sodium  dioxindol 
separate : 

C8H6£TaN03  +  2H  =  H20  +  C8H6NaN02, 

from  which  hydrochloric  acid  liberates  dioxindol,  also  termed  hydrindic 
CH.OH 

acid,  C8H7N02  =  C6hX      ^CO.       Dioxindol   dissolves  readily  in 

\h 

water  and  alcohol,  crystallises  in  transparent  yellow  prisms,  and  yields 
saline  compounds  with  both  bases  and  acids  ;  e.g.  C8H7N02,HC1.  On 
exposure  to  air  it  oxidises  readily  into  isatine,  and  on  treatment  of 
its  alcohol  solution  with  nitrous  anhydride  it  yields  nitroso-dioxindol, 
C8H6(NO)N02,  a  crystalline  substance,  melting  at  above  300°. 
Gentle  heating  with  nitric  acid  converts  dioxindol  into  benzoic 
aldehyde. 

In  dilute  acid  solution  dioxindol  is  converted  by  nascent  hydrogen 
into  oxindol,  C8H7N02.     This  body  is  also  obtained  by  the  reduction 
of  orthonitro-phenyl  acetic  acid,  and  therefore  appears  to  be  an  inner- 
anhydride  of  orthamido-phenyl  acetic    acid,  its  structural   formula 
CH2 

being  C6H4^      ^>CO.     It  crystallises  in  colourless  needles,  melts  at 

NH 
1 20°,  and  can  be  distilled  unaltered  in  small  quantity ;  it  dissolves 
readily  in  hot  water  and  alcohol.     Exposed  to  air,  its  aqueous  solution 
oxidises  again  to  dioxindol.     It  yields  saline  compounds  with  metals 
and  bases ;  with  nitrous  acid  it  gives  nitroso-oxindol : 

C8H6(NO)NO, 

crystallising  in  golden  yellow  needles,  difficulty  soluble  in  water. 

Indol,  C8H7N,  is  obtained  by  passing  the  vapours  of  oxindol  over 
heated  zinc,  or  by  distilling  a  mixture  of  zinc  and  the  brownish  yellow 
powder  obtained  by  long  boiling  of  indigo  blue  with  zinc  and  hydro- 
chloric acid.  It  is  prepared  synthetically  from  nitro-cinnamic  acid  by 
heating  with  potassic  hydrate  and  zinc  filings.  It  forms  large  colour- 
less prisms,  which  melt  at  52°,  and  yields  by  combination  with  hydro- 
chloric acid  a  difficultly  soluble  salt,  decomposed  into  its  constituents 
on  boilinsj  with  water.

their  method  of  formation  leaves  no  doubt  that  the  benzene  nucleus 
has  the  nitrogen  atom  and  the  dicarbon  nucleus  united  to  it  in  the 
ortho  position,  but  with  regard  to  the  distribution  of  the  hydrogen

1159.  Anthroc-  /<>■,  CMH10  =  Os^/fTR  06H4,  is  a  large  con- 
stituent of  the  high  boiling  portions  of  coal-tar  oil,  from  which  it  is 
obtained  by  repeated  distillation  and  recrystallisation  of  the  solid 
fractions    from    \><  tkB   this    method   always    yields  a  yellow-

sunlight  in  solution  in  benzene.  The  colourless  solution  after  nitration 
from  para-anthracene  yields,  on  evaporation  of  the  solvent,  pure  an- 
thracene. 

Many  synthetic  methods  for  the  production  of  anthracene  are 
known.     Amongst  others  may  be  mentioned  passing  the  vapour  of 


686  COMPOUNDS   OF   CONJUGATED  BENZENE  NUCLKT. 

toluene  through  strongly  heated  tubes  filled  with  pumice  or  plumbic 
oxide : 

2C6H5.CH3  =  3H2  +  C6H4:C2H2:C6H4  ; 

by  heating  phenyl-tolyl  ketone  (liquid)  (§  1150)  with  zinc  dust : 

C6H5.CO.C6H4.CH3  +  Zn  =  ZnO  +  H2  +  C14H10; 

and  from  benzyl  chloride  (§  1027)  by  heating  with  water  to  190°. 
By  this  reaction,  however,  a  number  of  products  are  formed,  which 
by  distillation  give  anthracene  along  with  benzyl  toluene,  benzyl  ether, 
(fee.  Anthracene  is  finally  obtained  by  the  distillation  of  all  its  deriva- 
tives over  heated  zinc  dust. 

Perfectly  pure  anthracene  crystallises  in  colourless  rhombic  tables 
having  a  magnificent  blue  fluorescence.  It  melts  at  213°  and  boils 
somewhat  over  360°.  It  is  totally  insoluble  in  water  and  only  very 
slightly  so  in  alcohol  and  ether.  Warm  benzene  dissolves  it  more 
readily. 

When  concentrated  solutions  of  anthracene  and  trinitro-phenol 
are  mixed  beautiful  red  needles  of  the  compound 

C14H10,2C6H2(NO2)3.OH 
separate. 

Para-anthracene,  isomeric  or  polymeric  with  anthracene,  separates 
from  the  solutions  of  the  latter  when  exposed  to  sunlight.  It  differs 
from  anthracene  by  its  insolubility  in  benzene,  its  greater  stability,  and 
complete  resistance  to  the  action  of  bromine  or  concentrated  nitric 
acid.  It  melts  at  244°,  being  at  the  same  time  converted  into  ordinary 
anthracene. 

1160.  Hydride*  of  Anthracene. — These  compounds  may  be  ob- 
tained by  heating  anthracene  with  hydric  iodide  and  phosphorus.  At 
a  temperature  of  160°-170°  anthracene  d\hydridet  C14H12,  is  pro- 
ducts!, the  same  body  being  also  formed  when  anthracene  is  heated 
with  sodium  amalgam  and  alcohol  tor  a  long  time.  This  substance 
crystallises  in  small  colourless  monoclinic  tables,  which  dissolve  easily 
in  alcohol  and  ether,  melt  at  106°,  and  boil  at  305°.  At  a  red  heat 
it  is  again  broken  up  into  anthracene  and  hydrogen  j  also  by  heating 
with  concentrated  hydric  sulphate,  with  reduction  of  the  latter  to 
sulphite.  By  very  long  continued  heating  of  anthracene  with  hydric 
iodide  and  phosphorus  to  about  220°  anthracene  hexahydride,  C14H16, 
is  produced,  which  also  forma  Leafy  crystals,  easily  soluble  in  alcohol 
and  ether,  melting  at  63°,  and  boiling  at  290°.  It  behaves  similarly 
to  the  dilivdride  when  heated  with  sulphuric  acid. 

1161.  Halogen  Derivat  . — Chlorine  and  bromine 
form  both  addition  and  substitution  products  with  anthracene. 
Chlorine,  for  instance,  forms  in  the  fir>t  instance  an  anthracene 
dicMoride,  Ci4H10Cl2,  crystallising  in  long  needles,  from  which 
alcoholic  potash  removes  one  atom  of  chlorine,  yielding  monocldur- 
aiithrac ■■ne>  small  scaly  crystals  resulting.  The  same  body  also  results 
from  heating  anthracene  in  a  stream  of  chlorine  gas.  Other  chlor- 
substitution  products,  C14H8C12  and  Ci4H6Cl4,  crystallise  in  yellow 
needles,  of  209°  and  220°  melting  points  respectively. 

On  adding  bromine  to  a  solution  of  anthracene  in  sulphide  of 
carbon  the  sole  product  is  dibrom-anthracene,  C14H8Br2,  golden  yellow

needles  melting  at  221°,  which  on  heating  with  alcoholic  potash  to 
160°  is  reduced  to  anthracene  with  simultaneous  oxidation  of  the 
alcohol.  Dibrom  anthracene  combines  directly  with  bromine  to  form 
dibrom-anthracxne  tetrabromide,  C14H8Br6,  the  same  body  being  also 
formed  by  the  action  of  bromine  vapour  on  finely  divided  anthracene. 
It  crystallises  in  colourless  tables,  which  melt  between  170°  and  180°, 
decomposing  at  the  Bame  time  into  tribrom-anthracene  : 

,H7Br3, 
yellow  volatile   needles,  melting  at  169°.     Dibrom-anthracene  tetra- 
bromide  heated  with    alcoholic    potash   yields  tetrabrom-anthracene,

method  for  the  preparation  of  anthraquinone  is  by  oxidation  of 
anthracene  dissolved  in  glacial  acetic  acid  with  potassic  dichromate. 
Nitric  acid  and  dichlor-  or  dibrom-aiitlira'  em-  may  also  be  used. 

Conclusive  proofs  of  the  constitution  of  anthraquinone  as  a 
double  k<  furnished  by  its  synthetical  methods  of  preparation. 

For  instance- - 

Liquid  phenyl-tolyl  ketone  pa  wad  in  a  state  of  vapour  overheated 

plumbic   oxide   yields  anthraquinone  \   it  fanned    by  heating 

osoyl  benzoic  acid  (§  L151 )  with  phosphoric  anhydride  to  200°  :

c6h4;^;:|  +  r,u,  =  21  in  +  o6h4;^;o6h4. 

From  its  formation  from  phthalyl  dichloride  it  seems  pretty  conclusive

After  being  sublimed  anthraquinone  forms  brilliant  yellow  needles, 
melting  at  273°,  which  are  easily  soluble  in  hot  benzene,  only  slightly 
so  in  cold  benzene,  or  alcohol,  or  ether.  It  is  reduced  by  heating  with 
hvdric  iodide,  phosphonium  iodide,  or  zinc  dust,  to  anthracene.  Potash, 
when  heated  with  it  to  250°,  splits  it  up  into  benzoic  acid :

anthraquinone  (§  1166).       On  dissolving  the  fused  product  in  water 
and  adding  HC1  alizarine  is  precipitated,  and  purified  by  sublimation 
or    recrystallisation    from    alcohol.     Erythro-oxyanthraquinone 
yields  alizarine  when  melted  with  potash. 

The  constitution  of  alizarine  is  shown  by  its  synthesis  from  phthalic 
anhydride  and  pyrocatechin  when  heated  with  sulphuric  acid  to  140°. 
The  brown  liquid  gives,  on  addition  of  water,  a  black  precipitate,  from 
which  alizarine  may  be  extracted  by  means  of  alcohol.  Since  pyro- 
catechin may  be  regarded  as  ortho-dihydroxy-benzene,  one  of  the 
following  two  formulae  must  represent  alizarine  :

Alizarine  crystallises  from  alcohol  or  ether  in  brownish  yellow 
prisms  containing  water,  which  by  drying  become  red  ;  it  melts  at 
215°,  and  can  be  sublimed  by  carefully  heating  in  long  red  needles. 
It  is  slightly  soluble  in  boiling  water,  more  so  in  alcohol  and  ether. 

Diaceto-alizarine,  C14Hfl(O.C2H30)202,  is  produced  as  a  yellow 
powder  on  heating  alizarine  with  acetic  anhydride. 

As  a  diphenol  alizarine  forms  compounds  with  metals.  It  dis- 
solves in  potash  to  a  fine  purple  colour,  CH 1 1()(0K)20.2.  An  alcoholic 
solution  of  alizarine  give*  blue  precipitates  with  lime  and  baryta 
water,  014H6(O1Ca)Os,OH]  and  < \u  H„(02Ba)02,OH2.  Alkaline 
solutions  of  alizarine  and  alum  give  a  beautiful  red  lake.  Gi 
mordanted  with  alumina  are  dyed  deep  red  with  alizarine.  Iron 
salts  give  a  violet  colour.

On  warming  an  alkaline  alizarine  solution  with  tin,  the  violet

Ruberytkric  acvJ  can  be  extracted  from  fresh  madder  root  by  cold 
water.  After  precipitating  other  matters  with  normal  plumbic  acetate 
the  filtrate  is  treated  with  basic  plumbic  acetate,  to  precipitate 
rubervthric  acid.  The  red  deposit  is  then  decomposed  by  sulphur- 
etted hydrogen  and  extracted  with  alcohol.  Ruberythric  acid  crystal- 
lines in  yellow  prisms,  which  are  readily  soluble  in  hot  water,  alcohol, 
and  ether  ;  it  is  converted  into  sugar  and  alizarine  by  fermentive 
actions,  acids,  or  alkalies.

3.  Antkrqflavone  is  often  obtained  in  small  quantities,  together 
with  alizarine,  from  the  disnbstitated  anthraquinones.     It  is  synthe- 

I  by  heating  metaoxyl»en/<>ic  acid  to  180°  for  many  hours  with 
hydric  sulphate.  The  liquid  yields,  on  dilution  with  water,  a  dark  green

with  animal  charcoal   the  barium  compound  is  decomposed  with  HC1 

and  the  dried  precipitate  extracted  with  ether.

frangulin,  with  mineral  acids.  It  crystallises  from  alcohol  in  orange 
yellow  quadratic  plates  or  needles,  2C14H6(OH)20.2,30H9,  which 
only  lose  their  water  at  180°  and  melt  between  252°  and  254°.  The 
diaceto  compound  forms  brass  yellow  plates,  melting  at  184°. 

The  glucoside/'/--// igtdin  is  isolated  from  the  bark  of  Rhamnus Fran- 
by  digestion  with  hot  alcohol,  and  forms  a  yellow  crystalline  mass 
almost  insoluble  in  water.    It  melts  at  226°,  dissolves  to  a  red-coloured 
solution  in  alkalies,  and  is  decomposed  by  dilute  acids  : 

C2oH20010  ==  ^i4H804  =  C6H1206. 

5.  Chrysophanic  acid  (parietic  or  rheinic  acid)  is  found  in  senna 
leaves,  in  rhubarb  root,  in  the  root  of  Rumex  obtusifolia,  and  in 
ParmeUa  parietina,  from  all  of  which  it  may  be  easily  extracted  by 
dilute  potassic  hydrate.  Hydrochloric  acid  precipitates  it  from  this 
solution  in  golden  yellow  prisms,  which  after  recrystallisation  from 
chloroform  melt  at  162°.     It  forms  compounds  of  a  deep  red  colour

Chrysophanic  acid  sublimes  partly  undecomposed.     On  warming 
with  concentrated  nitric  acid  it  is  converted  into  chrysamminic  ac'ul

1168.  Purpurine,  trihydroxy-autltrn qui none  : 

C14H805  =  C14H5.(OH)3.02, 

occurs  along  with  alizarine  as  a  decomposition  product  of  the  gluco- 
sides  of  madder  root,  and  is  also  easily  produced  artificially  at  the 
same  time  as  alizarine  from  substituted  anthraquinones.  From 
alizarine  and  quinazarine  it  may  be  obtained  by  oxidation  with  Mn02. 
From  its  mode  of  formation  it  probably  possesses  the  constitution  :

It  forms  orange  yellow  prisms,  which  may  be  fused  and  sublimed 
without  decomposition,  are  more  soluble  in  water  than  alizarine,  and 
dissolve  in  alcohol,  ether,  and  alkalies  with  a  red  colour.  With  lime 
or  baryta  water  it  gives  yellow  precipitates,  and  on  heating  with  zinc 
dust  anthracene  is  obtained. 

Purpuroxanthine  is  the  product  of  the  reduction  of  an  alkaline 
purpurine  solution  by  phosphorus.  Hydrochloric  acid  throws  down 
from  this  solution  yellow  flocks  of  the  new  body,  which  may  be 
crystallised  from  alcohol.  It  is  soluble  in  acetic  acid,  benzene,  and 
alkalies,  in  which  latter  solution  it  absorbs  atmospheric  oxygen,  and 
gives,  on  the  solution  being  neutralised  with  an  acid,  a  precipitate  of 
purpurine.  This  reaction  allows  purpuroxanthine  to  be  regarded  as 
trihvdroxy-dihydranthraquinone,  C x ,  H5.(OH)30_,l  1 .,. 

Among  many  methods  for  the  preparation  of  alizarine  and  pur- 
purine from  madder  one  may  be  mentioned  which  makes  use  of  the 
ready  solubility  of  purpurine  in  cold  solutions  of  aluminic  salts,  alizarine 
being  difficultly  soluble  ;  another  depends  on  the  differing  degrees  of 
dopomposibility  of  their  glucosides.     If  powdered  madder  roots  are 


PUEPURINE.  693 

extracted  at  the  ordinary  temperature  with  water  containing  sul- 
phurous anhydride,  and  the  solution  of  the  glucosides  heated  to  40°, 
the  purpurine  compound  only  is  decomposed  with  precipitation  of 
purpurine,  whilst  it  is  only  after  the  filtrate  has  been  boiled  for  some 
hours  that  alizarine  is  precipitated  in  admixture  with  some  other 
bodies.  From  this  precipitate  pure  alizarine  may  be  extracted  by 
treatment  with  hot  petroleum  of  150°-170°  boiling  point. 

Madder-dyeing  depends  on  the  formation  of  alizarine  and  pur- 
pnrine  from  the  glucosides  of  the  root,  by  fermentation  and  decomposi- 
tion with  mineral  acids.  The  substance  occurring  in  commerce  under 
the  name  of  garancine  is  powdered  madder  root  that  has  been  treated 
with  sulphuric  acid,  which  therefore  contains  no  ruberythric  acid,  but 
only  the  colouring  matt 

1169.  Tetrx&ydroxy-anthraquvnone,  C14H806  =  C14H4(OH4)02,

cene on  heating  with  zinc  dust.

1.  Anthrackrytone,    C(jTr.J(OH)2'pQ'C6H2(OH)2,  is  obtained  from 

dioxybenzoic  acid  (§  1067,  3)  by  heating  with  4  times  its  weight  of 
sulphuric  acid  to  140°.  It  crystallises  from  alcohol  in  fine  yellow  red 
needles,  melting  at  320°.  It  is  almost  insoluble  in  water  and  difficultly 
so  in  alcohol  and  ether.  It  dissolves  in  alkaline  solutions  with  a  red 
colour. 

2.  Rufiopme,  prepared  from  opianic  acid  by  heating  with  sul- 
phuric acid  to  180°,  crystallises  in  yellowish  red  needles  and  crusts, 
pretty  soluble  in  alcohol,  slightly  in  boiling  water  and  ether,  and 
gives  violet  red  salts  with  alkali  s 

1170.  RufigaUic  acid,  CuH803,2HsO,  is  doubtless  a  hexahy- 
droxy-anthraquinone.  It  is  obtained  by  heating  gallic  acid  with  4 
times  it>  weight  of  sulphuric  acid  to  70°  or  80°.  It  forms  brown  red 
crystals,  which  become  anhydrous  at  120°.  It  is  insoluble  in  water, 
nearly  so  in  alcohol  and  ether.  It  forms  an  easily  soluble  red  com- 
pound with  alkalies  and  dyes  cloth  mordanted  with  alumina  a 
beautiful  red. 

The  formation  of  rufigallic  acid  is  expressed  by  the  equation  : 

2C6H2(OH)3CO.OH  =  20II2  +  C6H(OH)8;£g;C6H(OH)8. 
Heating  with  zinc  dust  reduces  it  to  anthracene.

of  ditolyl  methane  (§  1057,  2)  through  red-hot  tubes  filled  with 
pumice,  similarly  to  the  formation  of  anthracene  from  benzyl  toluene  :

The  sticky  mass  which  collects  in  the  receivers  is  washed  out  with 
alcohol  ether,  recrystallised  from  glacial  acetic  acid,  and  sublimed, 
when  it  forms  white  yellow  or  colourless  leafy  crystals,  in  the  latter 
case  having  a  strong  blue  fluorescence,  melting  between   198°  and

201°.  It  is  only  soluble  in  chloroform,  CS2,  and  benzol.  The  picric 
acid  compound  forms  long  red  needles. 

When  an  alcoholic  solution  of  methyl  anthracene  is  mixed  with 
strong  nitric  acid,  and  afterwards  evaporated,  a  product  is  obtained 
which  on  addition  of  water  yields  methyl  anthraquinone  : 

Ci5H,0O2  ==  C6H4  ^q'C6H3.CH3, 

which  crystallises  in  needles  and  plates  of  melting  point  162°-163°. 
Sulphuric  acid  converts  the  quinone  into  sulphonic  acids,  yielding,  on 
melting  with  potassic  hydrate  at  200°  and  subsequent  decomposition 
of  the  product  with  HC1,  methyl  alizarine  : 

C5i5H1o04  =  C6H/£q'C6H(OH)2.CH3, 

which  sublimes  between  250°  and   252°  in  red  needles  and  beh 
towards  alkalies  similarly  to  alizarine. 

1172.  Anthracene  carbonic  acids,  C15H9.CO.OH,  isomeric  with 
methyl  anthraquinone.  On  submitting  anthracene  monosulphonic  acids 
to  dry  distillation  with  potassic  ferrocyanide,  anthracene  carbonitrile, 
C14H9.CN,  is  produced,  which  on  boiling  with  alcoholic  potash  is  con- 
verted with  evolution  of  ammonia  into  the  potassic  salt  of  ^-anthracene 
carbonic  acid,  which  crystallises  from  hot  alcohol  in  yellow  needles, 
softening  between  220°  and  230°,  but  does  not  decompose  even  at 
280°.  It  is  insoluble  in  OH2  and  gives  easily  soluble  alkaline  salts.  The 
barium  and  calcium  salts  are  amorphous.  The  acid  yields  anthracene 
on  distillation  with  baric  oxide,  and  on  oxidation  with  <  r03  gives 

Anthraquinone  carbonic  acid,  C15H804  —  Cl4H-02.CO.OH,  which 
is  also  produced  by  oxidising  methyl  anthracene  with  chromic  acid  in

It  crystallises  in  yellow  needles,  melting  at  283°,  which  are  sub-

p-Antltracene  Carbonic  Acid. — On  heating  anthracene  in  a  sealed 
tube  with  COCl2  for  some  hours  to  200°  a  chloride,  C14H9.CO('l,  is 
probably  produced,  the  product  of  the  digestion  on  heating  with  soda 
solution  and  neutralisation  with  an  acid  (HC1),  giving  a  precipitate 
of  /^-anthracene  carbonic  acid,  which  forms  yellow  silky  needles, 
melting  at  206°  and  splitting  up  at  the  same  time  into  C02  and 
anthracene.  As  this  acid  is  very  easily  oxidised  by  chromic  acid  to 
C02  and  anthraquinone,  it  is  probably  constituted  thus  :

TRIPHENYL  METHANE.  695 

Compounds  Containing  Three  Benzene  Nuclei. 

1174.  Farad iphenyl  benzene,  C6H5.C6H4.C6H5,  is  formed  along 
with  diphenyl-  and  isodiphenyl-benzene  by  passing  benzene  vapour 
through  a  red-hot  tube,  and  alone  by  treating  a  mixture  of  para- 
dibroui-benzene  and  monobrom-benzene  with  sodium.  It  crystallises 
in  flat  needles,  melts  at  205°,  and  boils  at  about  400°,  dissolves  with 
difficulty  in  ether  and  boiling  alcohol,  easily  in  benzene.  Chromic 
aei  1  oxidises  it  to  paradiphenyl-carbonic  acid  (§  1148),  and  finally  to 
terephthalic  acid. 

The  isomeric  isodipJk  nyl-benzene  forms  long  branching  interlaced 
crystals,  fusing  at  85°  and  boiling  at  about  360°.  It  yields  benzoic 
acid  on  oxidation. 

1175.  The  hydrocarbons  next  to  be  described  are  of  much  greater 
importance,  their  derivatives  forming  to  a  great  extent  the  colouring 
matters  known  as  the  'aniline  dyes.' 

Triphenyl  methane,  CH.(C6Ha)3,  is  the  product  of  the  reaction 
between  benzal  chloride  (§  1031)  and  mercury  diphenyl  at  150°  : 

C6H6.CHC1,  +  2Hg(06H5)a  =  2Hg(C6H6)Ca  +  C6H,.CH:(C6H5),„ 

and  is  also  formed  by  heating  a  solution  of  diphenyl  carbinol  (§  1146) 
in  benzene  with  phosphoric  anhydride  : 

(C6H5)2:CH.OH  +  C6H6  +  P20,  =  2HP03  +  (C6H5)2:CH.C6H5. 

It  crystallises  from  alcohol  and  ether  in  shining  plates  of  92°  melting 
point,  and  distils  above  360°. 

Phosphoric   chloride   converts   it  into  triphenyl-carbon   chloride, 
I1,)3:CC1,  which  is  decomposed  immediately  by  water  into  tri- 
phenyl carbinol  ;  with    alcohol  it  gives  the  ethyl  ether  of  triphenyl 
carbinol,  (<  \,11  B8  (melting  point  78°). 

The  cnloride  is  decom]  -,>0°  into  HC1  and  a  hydrocarbon,

melting  at  207°,  and  on  reduction  with  zinc  yielding  paraleucaniline, 
C19H19N3,  which  on  oxidation  }7ields  pararosaniline.  Trinitro- 
(riphenyl-carbinol,  C19H1.J(N02)3.OH,  is  obtained  by  oxidising  trinitro- 
triphenyl  methane  with  chromic  acid  \  it  forms  colourless  crystals 
melting   at    171°,    and    by   reduction  with    zinc    is    converted    into

hydrochloride  has  the  formula  C19H130N6C13.  and  which  on  boiling 
with  water  yields  aurine.  On  reduction  pararosaniline  is  converted 
into  paraleucaniline,  whose  diazo  compound  on  boiling  with  alcohol  is 
converted  into  triphenyl-methane,  thus  showing  clearly  the  relations 
of  these  substances  to  that  hydrocarbon.     In  properties  paraleucani-

1176«.  The  parent  substance  from  which  most  of  the  commercial 

formed  U  ■  (-2oH19N3,  a  base  resulting  from  one 

molecule  of  aniline  and  two  molecules  of  toluidine,  and  which  can 

unite  with  one  to  three  equivalents  of  acid.       The  triacid  salts,  e.g. 

1  I  N"3,3HC1,  can  only  l>e  prepared  by  the  aid  of  excess  of  strong 
acids,  and  are  of  a  dull  yellowish  brown  colour.  Water  removes  two 
Kjiiivalents  of  acid  from  them,  leaving  the  monacid  salts.  These  are 
. .  ly  insoluble  in  cold  water,  but  dissolve  readily  in  hot  water  or 
alcohol  with  a  fine  red  colour;  their  how  a  beautiful  golden 

green  lustre. 

Rosaniline  can  exchange  three  of  the  hydrogen  atoms  united 
directly  to  nitrogen  for  hydrocarbon  nuclei  (alkyl,  c\rc),  the  successive 
substitution  of  such  atoms  changing  the  colour  from  the  red  of  the 
trimple  salts,  through  reddish  violet,  into  bluish  violet  or  pure  blue. 
All  aniline  colours  are  removed  from  their  solutions  by  nitrogenous 
(wool  and  Bilk),  the  latter  becoming  dyed. 

To  prepare  rosani.  aniline  rich  in  toluidine  is  heated  to 

140°— 180°    either   witli    oxidising  ag  -enic   acid   or 

mercuric  nitrate,  or  with  metallic  chlorides  which  can  suffer  partial 
reduction,  such  as  mercuiic  or  -tannic  chlorides.     The  formation  of 

uiline  can  be  expressed  by  the  equations  : 

C6H5.NH2+-<  ;11:NH    +  30  =  3H,0  +C,0H19N3 

C6H5.NH2  +  207H7.NH,  +  3SnCl4  =  C20H19N3,HC1 

+  5HC1  +  3SnCl2. 

Instead  of  employing  mineral  oxidising  reagents  crude  nitro-benzene 
containing  nitro-toluene  can  be  employed,  the  oxygen  of  which  effects 
the  oxidation  of  the  toluene  mixture,  whilst  the  nuclei  enter  the 
rosaniline  group.  The  presence  of  metallic  iron  and  of  HC1  appears  to 
be  essential.     The  following  expresses  one  of  the  resulting  reactions  : 

C6H5.X02  +  2C7H7.XII  .  =  2H20  +  CMH19N ... 

On  employment  of  nitrates  as  oxidising  agents  rosaniline  nitrate 
is  obtained  ;  metallic  chlorides  yield  rosaniline  hydrochloride  ;  arsenic 
acid  gives  the  araeniate  and  arsenita  The  latter  is  extracted  with 
water  and  precipitated  as  r.  saniline  hydrochloride  by  addition  of 
common  salt.    In  every  case  the  Baits  are  repurified  by  crystallisation. 

On  heating  the  aniline  colours  with  concentrated  or  Nordhausen 
sulphuric  acid  the  sulphonic  acid  group  (S02.OH)  enters  the  aromatic 
nucleus.  The  resulting  monosulphonic  acid  is  in  the  case  of  triphenyl 
rosaniline  precipitated  by  addition  of  water,  converted  into  the  sodic 
salt,  and  used  under  the  names  of  'Nicholson's'  or  'alkali  blues J 
for  wool-dyeing.  With  the  disulphonic  acids  it  is  necessary  to  treat 
the  whole  melt  with  milk  of  lime,  and  to  decompose  the  lime  salts, 
after  filtration,  with  sodic  or  amnionic  carbonates.  These  salts  then 
form   ■  soluble  blues,'   and  are  used  for  dyeing  silk  or  cotton.     The

reddish  crystalline  precipitate  by  supersaturating  hot  aqueous  solutions

The  quickly  filtered  solution  deposits  more  of  the  base  on  cooling  in 
the  form  of  colourless  plates,  C20H19N3,H2O,  which  are  difficultly 
soluble  in  water,  more  readily  in  alcohol,  are  insoluble  in  ether,  and 
are  soon  coloured  red  on  exposure  to  air. 

Rosaniline  hydrochloride,  fuclisine,  C20H20N3C1,  crystallises  in 
golden  green  rhombic  octahedra,  soluble,  especially  in  alcohol,  with 
fine  red  colour.  On  heating  with  strong  hydrochloric  acid  it  dissolves 
with  brown  colour,  forming  the  triacid  salt  C20H19N3,3HC1,  which 
separates  on  cooling  in  yellowish  brown  needles. 

Rosaniline  nitrate,  C20H19N3.HNO3,  and  rosaniline  acetate:

chloric acid.  It  forms  shining  monoclinic  piisms,  closely  resembling 
those  of  aurine,  and  also  melting  above  220°.  With  hydric  potassic 
sulphite  it  gives  a  crystalline  compound,  C20H16O3,KHSO3,  from 
which  it  can  be  again  separated  by  boiling  with  water  or  addition  of 
acids  or  alkalies.  It  unites  with  nascent  hydrogen,  forming  kucorosolic 
acid,  C2oH1803,  crystallising  in  large  prisms  and  yielding  with  chlor- 
acetyl  fine  needles  of  the  triacetate,  C.2oH15(O.C2II30)3. 

1179.  AUcyl-suLstitv.tcd  rosanUhv-s  are  prepared  by  heating  rosani-

trialkyl  rosaniline  salts,  of  violet  colour  in  solution,  chiefly  occur  in 
commerce.    The  most  important  i>  trimethyl  rosaniline  hydrochhr'i

known  as  Hofmann's  violet. 

On  heating  rosaniline  with  aniline,  at  the  boiling  point  of  the 
alter,  and  in  the  presence  of  a  small  quantity  of  an  organic  acid, 
acetic  or  benzoic  being  generally  employed,  ammonia  is  evolved,  with 
formation  of  mono-,  di-,  and  triphenyl-rosaniline.  This  introduction  of 
.he  phenyl  groups  causes  successive  alterations  of  the  colours  of  the 
solutions,  C20H18(C6H5)N3,HC1  being  red  violet, 

C20H17(C6H5)2N3,HC1 

bluish  violet,  and  C20H16(C6H5)3]Sr3,HCl  pure  blue.     This  latter,  tri-

is   insoluble  in  water  and  only  slightly  soluble  in  alcohol ;  on  distil-

niline  acetat e  with  double  the  quantity  of  methylic  iodide  and 
wood  spirit  in  strong  closed  vessels  for  ten  hours  at  100°.  After  the 
unaltered  liquid  ingredients  have  been  distilled  off  the  residue  is 
extracted  with  a  strong  solution  of  common  salt,  when  iodine  green 
goes  into  solution. 

Iodine  green  crystallises  with  one  molecule  of  water  in  canthari- 
dine  green  prisms;  it  dissolves  in  alcohol  with  a  beautiful  green  colour, 
which  retains  its  purity  in  artificial  light.     The  picrate  : 

C20H16(CH3)3N3,2CH3I,2C6H2(NO2)3.OH, 

obtained  by  addition  of  picric  acid  to  its  solutions,  is  the  salt  of  iodine

phuric acid,  and  addition  of  sodic  hyposulphite  to  the  resulting 
solution  after  large  dilution  with  water,  '  aldehyde  green  *  is  obtained, 
and  can  be  precipitated  from  the  solution  by  addition  of  common 
salt. 

1181.  Leucanili/ie,  C20H21X3.  is  the  product  of  the  addition  of 
hydrogen  to  aniline.  Its  hydrochloride  results  from  the  treatment  of 
fuchsine  with  zinc  and  hydrochloric  acid  or  with  ammonic  sulphide. 
Addition  of  ammonia  to  its  colourless  salts  precipitates  it  as  a  white 
difficultly  soluble  powder,  which  soon  acquires  a  red  colour  on  ex- 
posure to  air.  Treated  with  nitrous  acid  it  gives  a  diazo  compound, 
which,  when  boiled  with  alcohol,  decomposes  into  nitrogen  and  ortho- 
tolyl-diphenyl  methane  (§  1176).  The  alkyl-substituted  rosanilines 
also  unite  with  two  atoms  of  hydrogen,  yielding  leuco  compounds. 

Chrysaniline,  C20H17]Sr3,  is  invariably  obtained  as  a  bye  product 
in  the  manufacture  of  rosaniline.  It  is  a  chrome  yellow  powder,  not 
very  soluble  in  cold  water,  readily  soluble  in  alcohol ;  it  dyes  silk  and 
wool  golden  yellow.  Like  rosaniline  it  forms  stable  monacid  salts 
and  diacid  salts,  which  are  decomposed  by  water ;  e.g. 

C20H!TX:J.HNO3, 

ruby  red  needles  difficultly  soluble,  and  C20H17N3,2HiSrO3,  dark  red 
prisms. 


700         COMPOUNDS  OF   CONJUGATED  BENZENE  NUCLEI. 

Though  of  other  composition,  the  earliest  known  aniline  colour — 
mauve'ine — may  be  conveniently  described  here.     Its  sulphate  : 

C27H24N4,rI2S04, 

is  formed  when  dilute  solutions  of  a  mixture  of  aniline  and  toluidine 
sulphates  and  potassic  dichromate  are  mixed.  The  solution  is  purple 
red.  Addition  of  alkalies  liberates  the  free  base,  C27H24N4,  as  a 
nearly  black  crystalline  powder,  soluble  in  alcohol  with  violet  colour. 
All  its  salts  are  crystalline  and  have  a  cantharidine  green  lustre.  Its 
formation  may  be  represented  by  the  equation  : 

C6H7N  +  3C7H9N  +  50  =  C27H24N4  +  5H20. 

1182.  Pai'atolyl-diphenyl  methane: 

^2oH18  =  (C6H5)2CH.C6H4.CH3, 
results  by  heating  tolyl-diphenyl  carbinol  with  benzene  and  phosphoric 
anhydride.     It  forms  colourless  crystals,  melting  at  71°  and  boiling 
above  360°. 

On  oxidation  it  yields  an  acid  : 

C20H16O3  =  (C6H3)2:C(OH).C6H4.CO.OH, 

difficult  to  crystallise,  melting  at  187°,  and  giving  a  barium  salt 
crystallising  in  silky  interlaced  needles  : 

(C20H16O3)2Ba,7OH2, 

difficulty  soluble  in  water. 

Phthaleins. 

1183.  Phthalic  anhydride  and  phenols,  on  gently  heating  with 
a  dehydrating  agent,  such  as  sulphuric  acid,  combine  to  form  the  so- 
called  phthaleins,  probably  according  to  the  equation  : 

C6H4'£°0  +  2(C6H)(6_I)(OH)I  =  OH2 
'    ,'     H.CO.C6H(5.I)(OH)I 

They  are  all  soluble  in  alkalies  with  formation  of  brilliant-coloured 
solutions. 

By  acting  on  the  bodies  in  alkaline  solution  with  nascent  hydrogen 
from  zinc  dust,  colourless  additions  products,  phthalines,  are  obtained, 
and  may  be  precipitated  by  acidifying  the  solutions. 

On  heating  the  phthaleins  to  a  high  temperature  with  sulphuric 
acid  a  phenol  group  in  combination  with  the  phthalic  acid  radical 
is  generally  split  oft'  in  the  form  of  a  sulphonic  acid,  and  an  anthra- 
quinone  derivative  is  simultaneously  produced,  thus  : 

c«h^:coah4:oh  +  2H2S°4  -  c6h4;^;c6h3.oh 

+  C6H3(OH)(S03H)2  +  20H2, 

giving  a  mixture  of  the  two  hydroxy-anthraquinones  (§  1167,  2). 
Resorcin  phthalein  gives  alizarine  and  hydroquinone  phthalein  chini- 
zarine. 

Of  the  numerous  compounds  already  prepared  in  this  group  only 
the  following  can  be  mentioned  here  : —

meric with  the  phenyl  salts  of  the  phenylene  dicarbonic  acids  (§  1106), 
is  formed  by  heating  five  parts  of  phthalic  anhydride  with  ten  parts 
of  phenol  and  four  parts  of  sulphuric  acid  at  120°-130°.  The  red 
mass,  when  extracted  with  water,  leaves  a  resin,  which  is  converted 
into  a  clear  yellow  powder  by  boiling'with  benzene.  This  dissolves 
in  solution  of  potassic  hydrate  with  fine  red  colour,  without  doubt 
forming  C6H4(CO.C6H4.OK).2,  from  which  addition  of  hydrochloric 
acid  precipitates  phenol  phthalein  as  a  flocculent  mass.  The  alkaline 
solution  is  soon  decolourised  by  contact  with  powdered  zinc,  and  then 
yields,  on  addition  of  hydrochloric  acid,  colourless  phenol  phthaline, 
O20H16O4,  whose  alkaline  solution  on  exposure  to  air  soon  reoxidises 
and  regains  its  fine  colour. 

1185.  Resorcin  pJdhalein,  or  fluorescein,  can  be  obtained  even  with- 
out the  aid  of  sulphuric  acid  by  fusing  two  molecules  of  resorcin  with 
one  molecule  of  phthalic  anhydride  at  195°  until  water  is  no  longer 
evolved.  The  melt  is  then  boiled  with  water  and  the  residue,  after 
drying,  dissolved  in  three  times  its  weight  of  hot  acetic  acid,  the 
diacetate  being  formed,  which,  on  addition  of  alcohol,  separates  in 
plates ;  it  is  recrystallised  from  acetone  and  saponified  by  boiling  with 
alcoholic  potassic  hydrate.  Addition  of  acetic  acid  precipitates  the 
phthalein,  which  can  finally  be  recrystallised  from  alcohol. 

Fluorescein  exists  in  two  states  : 

as  tetrahydrate,  C20H14O6  =  C6H4;^;^^(OH)2 

PO  P  IT  ^OT-H 
and  as  anhydride  dihydrate,  C20H12O5  =  ^6^  '      '    gS/qttv'O 

The  first  is  invariably  precipitated  in  yellow  flocks,  also  the  latter, 
from  alkaline  solutions  by  supersaturating  with  acids,  and  is  con- 
verted into  the  anhydride  dihydrate  by  crystallisation  from  boiling 
alcohol,  by  heating  alone  at  130°,  or  by  heating  with  sulphuric  acid, 
acetic  anhydride,  ttc.  This  latter  form  is  obtained  first  in  the  syn- 
thesis of  fluorescein ;  it  forms  a  crystalline  brick  red  powder,  nearly 
insoluble  in  water,  ether,  and  benzene,  difficultly  soluble  in  alcohol 
and  acetone.  On  dilution  of  the  alcoholic  solution  it  separates  in 
clear  yellow  stellate  needles.  It  yields  alizarine  on  heating  with 
acids. 

It  dissolves  in  solutions  of  alkalies  and  ammonia  with  a  beautiful 
red  colour.  The  ammoniacal  solution  is  characterised  by  its  extra- 
ordinarily strong  green  fluorescence. 

The  diacetate,  C6H4'  <o'ri6TT3/(yn2Tj3r)\  0,  crystallises  in  colour- 
less plates,  melts  at  200°,  and  is  not  soluble  in  aqueous  alkalies. 

Alkaline  solutions  of  fluorescein  are  decolourised  by  zinc  dust ; 
addition  of  acids  then  precipitates  resorcin  phthaline  or  fluorescine ; 
oxidising  agents  reconvert  it  into  fluorescein. 

Tetrabrom-fluorescein,  or  eosine,  C20H8Br4O5,  is  readily  obtained 
by  the  action  of  bromine  on  fluorescein.  It  forms  a  brownish  red 
powder,  which  crystallises  from  acetic  acid  in  yellow  prisms.

form  red  crystals  of  golden  green  lustre,  dissolving  in  water  and  alcohol 
with  a  beautiful  deep  red  colour,  and  on  sufficient  dilution  imparting  a 
greenish  yellow  fluorescence  to  the  liquid. 

1186.  Hydroquinone  phihaltin,  isomeric  with  the  preceding,  is 
obtained  by  heating  phthalic  anhydride,  hydroquinone,  and  sulphuric 
acid.     It  crystallises  from  water  in  colourless  nacreous  plates  : 

C20H14O6 

(tetrahydrate),  which  at  170°  is  converted  into  the  dihydrate  an- 
hydride, C20H12O5,  a  colourless  mass  melting  at  233°.  It  dissolves 
in  concentrated  sulphuric  acid  with  brick  red  colouration,  in  alkalies 
with  a  violet  colour.  Chlor-acetyl  converts  it  into  a  crystalline  di- 
acetate,  C2oH10(C2H30)205.  When  strongly  heated  with  sulphuric 
acid  it  yields  chinizarine. 

1187.  Pyrogallol  phthale'in,  or  galein,i&  obtained  directly  by  heat- 
ing phthalic  anhydride  with  double  its  weight  of  pyrogallol.  It 
dissolves  difficultly  with  red  colour  in  hot  water,  more  readily  in 
alcohol.  It  can  be  recrystallised  from  hot  dilute  alcohol,  and  then 
forms  a  brownish  red  mass  with  blue  reflex  of  the  formula  : 

C20H14O8  =  C6H4:[CO.C6H2(OH)3]2, 

converted  at  180°  into  the  anhydride  tetrahydrate  :

Gallin,  or  pyrogallol  phthaline,  C20H18O7,  obtained  from  it  by 
reduction,  forms  large  colourless  crystals. 

Mellitic  and  pyromellitic  acids  yield  similar  compounds  with 
hydroxy  derivatives  of  benzene. 

Conjugated  Compounds  with  Four  Benzene  Nuclei. 

1188.  Triphenyl  benzene,  C24H18  =  C6H3(06H5)3(?),  is  formed  by 
heating  phenyl-methyl  ketone  with  phosphoric  anhydride  or  hydro- 
chloric acid  gas.  It  crystallises  from  absolute  alcohol  and  benzene  in 
short  prisms,  and  melts  at  169°-170°. 

Tetraphenyl  methane,  C25H2o  =  C(C6H5)4,  is  formed  by  the  action 
of  aluminic  chloride  on  a  mixture  of  carbonic  tetrachloride  and  benzene, 
also  in  the  dry  distillation  of  baric  benzoate.  It  forms  colourless 
needles,  melting  at  .170°. 

Diphenyl-phenylene  methane,  C25H20  =  (C6H5.C6H4)2:CH2,  is 
obtained  by  the  action  of  cold  sulphuric  acid  on  a  solution  of  diphenyl 
and  methylal  in  glacial  acetic  acid  (comp.  §  1145).  It  is  purified  by 
precipitation  with  water  and  solution  in  benzene,  and  on  evaporation 
of  that  solvent  forms  small  colourless  monoclinic  crystals,  melting  at 
162°.  Chromic  and  sulphuric  acids  readily  oxidise  it  to  diphenyl- 
phenylene  ketone,  C25H180  =  (C6H5.C6H4)2 :  CO,  which  forms  granular 
crystalline  aggregates,  and  readily  combines  two  atoms  of  nascent 
hydrogen,  forming  diphenyl  benzhydrol,  or  diphenyl-phenylene  carbi/tnl, 
(C6H5.C6H4)2:CH.OH.  This  secondary  alcohol  crystallises  in  white 
needles,  readily  soluble  in  alcohol  and  melting  at  151°. 

CH(C6H5)2 

Tetraphenyl  ethane,  C26H22  =  |  ,  is  obtained  by  heating

prisms,  melts  at  206°,  and  can  be  sublimed. 

Tetraphenyl  t  thyli  ra,  C26H20,is  obtained  by  dechlorinising  diphenyl 
carbon  dichloride  (§  1147)  by  silver: 

C(C6H5)2

C(C6H5)2 

and,  together  with  other  hydrocarbons  (diphenyl  methane,  &c),  by 
heating  benzo-phenone  and  zinc  dust.     It  crystallises  from  benzene  in 
spear-shaped  needles,  and  is  difficultly  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether. 
Mauveine  probably  also  belongs  to  this  group.

1189.  In  these  compounds  the  carbon  atoms  in  the  nucleus  are 
arranged  in  such  a  manner  that  built  up  of  two  or 

more  closed  hexacarbon  chains,  a  pair  of  carbon  atoms  being  common 
o  chains.     Assuming  the  tetrav  ire  of  carbon,  and  the 

correctness  of  the  formula  assigned  to  benzene,  no  other  probability 
a  than  that  the  carbon  atoms  common  to  two  rings  are  neighbour-

These  atoms  belonging  to  the  two  nuclei  can  evidently  not  com- 
bine with  any  further  elementary  atoms  (as  long  as  the  alternate 
mono-  and  divalent  union  remains),  whilst  all  the  others  have  each 
one  bond  available  for  union  with  other  elementary  atoms.  If 
latter  is  hydrogen,  the  hydrocarbons,  C10H8.C,4H10.  Ac.  result.  In 
such  hydrocarbons  the  hydrogen  atoms  are  replaced  by  other  elen.

riginal  molecules  that  the  aromatic  compounds  containing  more

1193.  The  most  important  arguments  for  assigning  the  more  simple

one  orthophenylene  nucleus,  which  remains  unchanged  in  phthalic 
add.  lAch   the  group   C4H4    must   be  united

C10H18,C6H2(NO2)3OH, 

crystallising  in  fine  yellow  needles  grouped  in  stellate  forms. 

Naphthalene  occurs  in  the  products  of  the  dry  distillation  of  nearly 
all  organic  bodies,  and  is  obtained  by  passing  the  vapour  of  phenyl- 
butylene  dibromide  over  heated  lime  : 

C6H5.C4H7Br2  +  CaO  =  CaBr,  +  H20  +  H2  +  C10H8. 

On  heating  with  hydriodic  acid  and  amorphous  phosphorus  at  180°  it 
yields  naphthalene  tetrahydride,  C10H12,  as  a  colourless  liquid  lighter 
than  water,  which  boils  at  205°  and  at  a  red  heat  decomposes  into 
naphthalene  and  hydrogen,  and  is  readily  oxidised  to  phthalic  acid  by 
nitric  acid. 

Substitution  Products  of  Naphthalene. 

1192.  By  replacement  of  a  single  hydrogen  atom  in  naphthalene 
two  isomeric  compounds  can  result,  but  in  no  case  have  more  than 
two  been  observed.  This  agrees  with  the  formula  already  given, 
according  to  which  the  positions  3,  6,  7,  and  10  are  of  equal  value, 
whilst  the  positions  4,  5,  8,  and  9  are  of  equal  value  as  regards  one 
another  but  of  different  value  as  regards  the  first  four.  These  two  sets 
of  four  positions  may  be  distinguished  by  the  letters  a  and  ft  as  shown 
in  the  formula : 


/\/\, 


With  regard  to  assigning  the  positions  a  and  ft  to  naphthalene 
derivatives,  it  has  been  shown  that  on  oxidation  of  ordinary  nitro- 
naphthalene,  1:3:4  nitrophthalic  acid,  melting  at  212°,  is  obtained, 
from  which  it  follows  that  the  nitro  group  must  have  occupied  the  a 
position  in  nitro-naphthalene.  By  reference  to  this  body  the  positions 
of  the  other  naphthalenes  can  be  settled.  It  may  be  added  that  direct 
riments  have  shown  that  all  four  a  positions  are  really  of  the 
same  value  in  mono-substituted  naphthalene  derivatives. 

In  order  to  indicate  the  positions  to  be  assigned  to  the  position-  <»f 
replacement  the  following  signs  will  be  employed  : — The  numbers  1 
and  2  annexed  to  the  a  and  ft  positions  will  serve  to  show  which  «  or

bols, it  will  indicate  that  the  replacement  positions  are  in  the  same 
hexagon,  e.g.  a, — ft2  ;  if,  on  the  contrary,  two  lines  are  drawn  between 
the  symbols,  it  will  indicate  that  the  substitution  has  occurred  in  both 
the  hexagons,  e.g.  a,=a1. 


CIILOR-XAPIITHALENES.  707 

On  replacement  of  two  hydrogen  atoms  in  naphthalene  the  possible 
cases  of  isomerism  become  much  more  numerous.  AY  hen  the  replacing 
groups  are  the  same  ten  isomers  are  possible,  the  number  of  possible 
isomers  being  still  larger  in  the  case  of  the  tri  (14),  tetra  (22),  and 
penta  (14)  derivatives.  It  is  not  surprising  under  these  circumstances 
that  considerable  uncertainty  exists  in  some  of  the  previous  observa- 
tions and  views,  and  therefore  only  a  few  of  the  more  important 
compounds  will  be  noticed  here.

only  substitution  products  are  obtained.  The  addition  products  are

Tetrabrom-naphthalene  and  pentabrom-naphthalene  are  crystalline 
solids.  If  naphthalene  remains  for  a  long  time  in  contact  with 
excess  of  bromine  it  yields  colourless  rhombic  plates  of  dibrom- 
naphthalene  tetrabromide.

into  two  isomeric 


AMID0-NAP1ITHALENES.  7  09 

Dhiltro-najjhthahnes,  C10H6(NO2)2,  of  which  that  more  difficultly 
soluble  in  alcohol  (alz=zai)  forms  sublimable  coloui'iess  prisms, 
melting  at  216°,  the  more  readily  soluble  (3-dinitro-naphthalene 
(a^tt,)  melting  at  170°  and  exploding  at  higher  temperatures.  A 
third  isomer  (ax — /3),  melting  at  1^4°,  is  obtained  by  the  action  of 
ethylic  nitrite  on  C10H-,(NO2)2NH2.  Three  trinitro-naphthalenes 
are  known:  two,  melting  respectively  at  147°  (al=a2Y)  and  122° 
(o1=a2^))  are  obtained  by  the  action  of  nitric  acid  on  a-dinitro- 
naphthalene;  the  third  (a^a^),  melting  at  214°,  by  nitration  of 
/3-dinitro-naphthalene.  a-Tetranitro-naphthalene,  C10H4(NO2)4,  is 
obtained  by  nitrating  a-C10H6(NO2)2 ;  it  melts  at  259°.  (j-Tetranitro- 
naphthalene  is  similarly  obtained  from  /3-C10H6(NO2)2 ;  it  melts  at 
200°. 

1196.  Amido-na phtlmlenes. — Unless  otherwise  mentioned  these 
bodies  have  been  prepared  by  reduction  of  the  corresponding  nitro- 
naphthalenes  by  amnionic  sulphide  or  by  tin  and  hydrochloric  acid. 

a-Amido-naphthalene,  naphthylamine,  or  naphthalidine,  crystallises 
in  thin  colourless  prisms,  and  lias  an  unpleasant  odour,  like  that  of  the 
excrements  of  mice ;  it  is  scarcely  soluble  in  water,  more  readily  in 
alcohol,  melts  at  50°  and  boils  at  about  300°. 

In  its  chemical  behaviour  «-amido-naphthalene  closely  resembles 
aniline;  exposed  to  air  it  oxidises,  acquiring  a  red  colour.  It  yields 
crystalline  salt-  with  acids,  mostly  soluble  in  water,  and  on  heating 
with  glacial  acetic  acid  forms  long  fine  crystals  of  a cet naphthalide, 
C10H7.N(C2H3O)H,  whose  solution  in  glacial  acetic  acid,  on  treatment 
with  fuming  nitric  acid,  yields  three  isomeric  nitro-acetnaphthalides, 
C10H6(NO2)N(C2H3O)H.  Naphthalidine  hydrochloride  reacts  on 
aniline  on  lon^r  heating  at  L'SU=,  forming  amnionic  chloride  and 
phenyl  naphihalidine,  C10H7.N(C6H5)H.  This  latter  crystallises  in 
warty  forms,  melts  at  60°,  and  possesses  very  weak  basic  properties. 
Treated  with  carbon  disulphide,  naphthalidine  yields  dinaphthyl 
thiourea,  CS(N.(.'10H7.H)2. 

Nitrous  acid  converts  the  salts  of  a -naphthylamine  into  those  of 
dicizo-naphthcUcne,  e.g.  Cl0H7.N2.HNO3,  which,  on  boiling  their 
solutions,  decompose  into  nitrogen,  free  acid,  and  a-naphthol  (comp. 
§  976).  On  conducting  nitrous  anhydride  into  a  cold  solution  of 
free  naphthalidine,  yellowish  brown  plates  of  the  formula  C20H15O3, 
ilutzo-omido-ii'tplithcdene,  C10H7.N2.N(C10H7)H,  separates.  It  is  ex- 
plosive, and  on  heating  even  with  weak  acids  decomposes  into 
nitrogen,  ct-naphthylamine,  and  a-naphthol. 

fi- Amido-na phtlt< dene  is  obtained  by  reduction  of  CI0H6Br(NO2) 
(m.p.  131°-132°)  with  tin  and  hydrochloric  acid  j  it  melts  at  112°.  Its 
salts  are  reduced  to  those  of  fi-diazo-napldhalene  on  treatment  with 
nitrous  acid. 

1197.  Amnionic  sulphide  reduces  a-dinitro-naphthalene  in  the 
cold  to  a-nitramido-naf)hthalene  (a,=a2),  forming  small  red  crystals 
melting  at  118°-119°,  which  on  further  action  of  reducing  agents  is 
transferred  into  a-diamido-naphthalene,  or  naphtliylene  diamine, 
C10H6(NH2)3  (a1=a2).  This  latter  crystallises  in  shining  prisms, 
melts  at  160°,  and  yields  difficultly  soluble  salts  with  sulphuric  and 
hydrochloric  acids. 

Isomeric  nitro-amido-naphthalenes  have  been  prepared  from  nitro-

passing  nitrous  anhydride  into  a  warm  alcoholic  naphthalidine  solution. 
It  crystallises  in  orange-red  needles  of  metallic  green  lustre,  melts  at 
136°,  and  yields  salts  with  two  equivalents  of  acid.  On  heating  with 
naphthylamine  ammonia  is  evolved  and  a  new  base,  azo-dinaphthyl- 
amine,  C30H21]S"3,  formed,  whose  salts  occur  in  commerce  as  a  fine  red 
dye  under  the  name  of  Magdala  red  :

Tin  and  hydrochloric  acid  reduce  amido-azo-napldhahne  to  naph- 
thylamine and  a  second  diamido-naphthalene,  forming  shining  crystals, 
which  quickly  oxidise  on  exposure  to  air.  A  third  isomer  is  obtained 
by  reduction  of  /3-clinitro-naphthalene. 

1198.  Naphthalene  sulphonic  acids  are  formed  on  heating  naph- 
thalene with  concentrated  sulphuric  acid.  If  the  temperature  is  kept 
as  low  as  possible  a-naphthalene  sidphonic  acid,  C10H7.SO2.OH 
(m.p.  85°-90°),  is  principally  obtained,  together  with  some  quantity 
of  the  isomeric  ^-naphthalene  sulphonic  acid.  At  1G0°  only  the  latter 
acid  is  obtained,  as  the  former  is  converted  into  it  below  this 
temperature.  The  acids  can  be  separated  from  one  another  in  the 
forms  of  their  baric  or  lead  salts,  the  respective  solubilities  of  which 
at  10°  are-

On  heating  their  potassic  salts  with  phosphoric  pentachloride 
isomeric  crystalline  naphthalene  sulphon-chlorides,  C10H7.SO2Cl,  are 
formed,  of  which  the  a  compound  melts  at  C6°,  the/3  compound  at  76°. 
Zinc  and  dilute  sulphuric  acid  reduce  both  sulphon-chlorides  to 
hydrothio-naphthalenes.  Then  compound  is  an  oil  of  nauseous  odour, 
boiling  at  285°;  the  /3  compound  crystallises  in  scales  and  melts  at 
136°;  both  behave  like  true  mercaptans. 

Long-continued  heating  of  naphthalene  with  much  sulphuric  acid 
converts  it  into  two  isomeric  naphthalene  disulphonic  acids.  With 
sulphuric     anhydride    naphthalene    yields    sidphon-naphthalene,    or

corresponding  to  the  isomeric  sulphonic  acids  are  known.  They  are 
prepared,  analogously  to  the  formation  of  phenols,  from  the  benzene 
sulphonic  acids,  by  fusing  the  respective  benzene  sulphonic  acids  with 
potassic  hydrate : 

C,0H7.SO2OK  +  2KOH  =  K2S03  +  H20  +  C10H7.OK, 

and  are  extracted  with  ether  after  the  fused  mass  has  been  acidulated; 
they  are  also  obtained  by  boiling  the  salts  of  the  corresponding  diazo- 
naphthalenes  with  water  (comp.  §  976).  They  behave  towards 
alkalies,  carbonates,  <kc,  like  true  phenols,  and  are  difficultly  soluble 
in  water,  even  on  boiling. 

a-Naphthol  crystallises  in  monoclinic  prisms,  melts  at  94°,  and 
boils  at  278°-280°.

and  boils  between  285°  and  290°. 

Ferric  chloride  oxidises  both  naphthols  to  C20HuO2  (naphthyl 
peroxides,  C10H7.O.O.G10H7 1),  of  which  the  a  compound  forms  silvery 
plates,  melting  at  300°  ;  the  /3  compound  crystallises  in  prisms  and 
melts  at  218°. 

The  potassium  derivatives.  C10H7.OK,  yield  with  ethylic  iodide

pared. Xitro-a-nopltthols,  C10H6(NO2).OH.  Two  bodies  of  this 
formula  have  been  obtained  by  boiling  nitro-acetnaphthalides  with 
potash.  n-Xifro-a-iiiiphthol  («, — «2)  melts  at  164°  and  crystallises 
in  bright  yellow  prisms;  the  isomer  (a2 — /3)  melts  at  128°  and 
crystallises  in  greenish  vellow  plates.  Xitro-p-naphthol  (/3—  X)  melts 
at  96°. 

Three  nitroso-naphthols  are  known,  corresponding  in  composition 
to  the  above,  into  which  they  are  converted  by  oxidation.  They  are 
formed  by  the  action  of  nitrous  acid  on  the  naphthols.  The  two  from 
a-naphthol  melt  at  175°-185°  and  145°-150°  respectively;  that  from

is  of  more  importance,  as  its  calcic  and  iodic  salts  form  splendid 
yellow  dve.s  known  as  naphthalene  yellow.  It  cannot  be  prepared 
directly  from  a-naphthol,  but  is  obtained  by  the  action  of  nitric  acid 
of  T35  sp.  gr.  on  naphthylamine,  or  by  heating  the  latter  with

being  formed.  After  separation  of  the  tin  by  sulphuretted  hydrogen 
the  solution  containing  the  diamido-naphthol  hydrochloride  slowly 
oxidises  in  the  air,  or  more  quickly  on  addition  of  ferric  chloride

From  this  silt,  which  crystallises  in  red  prisms  or  tables  of  metallic 
green  lustre,  ammonia  separates  yellow  crystals  of  diimido-riaphthol,

ether  and  hot  alcohol,  and  crystallises  in  large  sulphur  yellow  tables 
of  persistent  odour;  it  melts  at  125°,  but  sublimes  slowly  at  far 
lower  temperatures.     Nitric  acid  oxidise!  it  to  phthalic  acid. 

iphtlio-cpitn-one  (/3 — ?)  is  prepared  from  nitroso-p-naphthol  by

melts  at  176°,  and  is  retransformed  into  naphtho-quinone  by  oxidising 
agents. 

Dioxy-naphthcUene,  isomeric  with  the  preceding,  is  prepared  by 
fusing  naphthalene  disulphonic  acid  with  potassic  hydrate.  It  crystal- 
lises in  needles,  which  become  violet-coloured  on  exposure  to  light, 
and  melts  at  186°.  Its  alkaline  solutions  eagerly  absorb  oxygen  and 
become  of  a  black  colour. 

A  third  isomer  (alz=za2),  obtained  by  indirect  processes  from

difficultly  soluble,  yellow,  crystalline  powder,  which  melts  above  200° 
and  sublimes  in  needles.  Phosphoric  chloride  converts  it  also  into

have  not  yet  been  prepared,  but  two  acids  are  known  of  the  formula 
C10H7.CO.OH,  the  naphthyl  carbonic  or  naphthoic  acids  and  an 
aldehyde,  C10H7.CHO. 

The  naphthoic  acids  are  prepared  from  the  potassic  naphthalene 
sulphonates,  which  by  dry  distillation  with  potassic  cyanide  are  each 
converted  into  a  naphthyl  cyanide,  C10H7.CN.  a- Naphthyl  cyanide 
crystallises  from  alcohol  in  colourless  broad  needles,  melts  at  37  5°, 
and  boils  at  298°;  ft-naphthyl  cyanide  forms  plates  melting  at  66*5° 
and  boiling  at  305°.  On  boiling  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  both 
evolve  ammonia,  and  are  converted  into  salts  of  the  corresponding 
naphthoic  acids,  from  which  the  free  acids  can  be  obtained  on  acidu- 
lating with  hydrochloric  acid.  These  closely  resemble  benzoic  acid, 
form  salts,  chlorides,  amides,  (C10H7.CO.NH2),  <kc.,  in  the  usual  way, 
and  yield  naphthalene  on  distillation  with  lime. 

a- Naphthoic  acid  has  also  been  prepared  by  fusing  a-naphthalene 
sulphonic  acid  with  sodic  formate.  It  crystallises  in  colourless  needles, 
melts  at  160°,  is  difficultly  soluble  in  boiling  water,  readily  in  hot

water  at  15°  for  solution.  Ef  hylic  a-naphthoate  is  prepared  by  the 
action  of  sodium  amalgam  on  a  mixture  of  a-brom-naphthalene  and 
ethylic  chloro-carbonate  (comp.  §  1045,  la);  it  is  an  oil  boiling  at 
309°.  A  mixture  of  fuming  nitric  acid  and  sulphuric  acid  converts 
a-naphthoic  acid  into  ci-nitro-naphthoic  acid,  forming  clear  yellow 
needles  melting  at  194°. 

ft-  or  isonaphthoic  acid  melts  at  182°  and  boils  above  300°.  Its 
calcic  salt  requires  1 ,400-1 ,800  parts  of  water  for  solution.  Nitro- 
ft-naphthoic  acid  melts  at  228°.  On  dry  distillation  of  an  intimate 
mixture  of  calcic  /3-naphthoate  and  formate  isonaphthoic  aldehyde  : 

C10H7.COH, 

is  obtained  in  the  form  of  leafy  crystals,  melting  at  59  5° ;  it  is  scarcely 
soluble  in  boiling  water,  but  volatilises  in  steam. 

Phosphoric  chloride  converts  both  naphthoic  acids  into  naphthoyl 
chlorides,  C10H7.COC1,  of  which  the  a  compound  is  liquid  at  ordinary 
temperatures,  the  /3-chloride  crystalline,  but  readily  fusible. 

1207.  Hydroxy-naphthoic  acids,  or  carbo-naphtholic  acids  : 

C10H6(OH)CO.OH, 

are  obtained  by  the  simultaneous  action  of  sodium  and  carbonic  an- 
hydride on  the  naphthols  (comp.  salicylic  acid,  §  1061).  a-Carbo- 
naphtholie  acid  crystallises  from  alcohol  and  ether  in  stellate  groups 
of  colourless  needles,  and  melts  at  185°-186° ;  its  salts  give  an  intense 
blue  coloration  with  feme  chloride.  ft-Carbo  naphtholic  acid  requires 
further  investigation. 

Other  isomers  are  obtained  by  solution  of  the  naphthoic  acids  in

in  pearly  plates,  melts  at  1 5 4 = ,  can  be  sublimed,  is  readily  soluble  in 
ether,  and  yields  phthalic  acid  on  oxidation. 

Ieodinaphthyl  (3 — p),  isomeric  with  the  above,  is  obtained  by

2.  Pi :--  n.flrnaphthyl  methane,  I  .  H -.CH2.C10H7,  is  obtained  by 
heating  100  parts  of  benzylic  chloride  with  80  pails  of  naphthalene 
and  15  parts  of  zinc  dust.  On  distilling  the  product  phenyl-naphthvl 
methane  passes  over  at  320°-350°  as  a  solid  mass,  crystallising  from 
alcohol  in  colourless  needles  and  melting  at  64°. 

Two  phenyl-naphthyl  ketones,  C6H5.CO.C10H7,  derived  from  a 
hydrocarbon  of  this  formula,  are  formed  simultaneously  by  heating 
benzoic  acid  with  naphthalene  and  phosphoric  anhydride  (comp. 
§  1147) ;  they  are  also  obtained  separately  by  heating  the  respective 
naphthoic  adds  with  benzene  and  phosphoric  anhydride.  PA

the  action  of  sulphuric  acid  on  a  mixture  of  naphthalene  and  methyl*] 
(comp.  §  1145).  It  crystallises  in  colourless  prisms,  melts  at  109°, 
can  be  distilled  unaltered,  and  yields  a  compound  with  two  molecules

C14H10,C6H2(NO2)3OH, 

which  separates  in  the  crystalline  form  from  a  concentrated  alcoholic

It  crystallises  in  colourless  plates  of  blue  fluorescence,  melts  be- 
n  96°  and  100°,  boils  at  340°,  and  dissolves  in  50  parts  of 
alcohol  at  19°.  Chromic  and  sulphuric  acids  oxidise  it  first  to 
phenanthrene  quinone,  and  farther  to  diphenic  acid. 

Phenanthrene  appears  to  l>e  a  diortho  compound,  as  on  oxidation 
of  phenanthrene  quinone  with  alkaline  permanganate  phthalic  acid  is 
obtained.  This  Bhows  conclusively  that  the  method  of  union  in  at

that  it  is  BO  in  both,  for  it  is  not  likely  that  if  meta  or  para  union 
occurred  no  isophthalic  or  terephthalic  acid  would  be  formed,  seeing 
thai  they  are  both  BO  much  more  stable  than  phthalic  acid.  Further 
but  more  complicated  proof-  haw  also  been  given  as  to  the  ortho

C14H14,  an  oil  boiling  at  300°-310°  and  difficultly  soluble  in  cold 
alcohol.  Addition  of  bromine  to  a  solution  of  phenanthrene  in  carbon 
di-ulphide  yields  phenanthrene  dibromide,  C14H10Br2,  crystallising  in 
colourless  prisms  and  decomposing  at  100°  into  hydrobromic  acid  and

C27H30O17  +  3H20  =  2C6H1206  +  C15H1208  (?). 

The  fraxetine  separates  out  in  colourless  needles  soluble  in  alcohol. 
It  dissolves  in  nitric  acid,  giving  first  a  violet,  then  red,  and  lastly 
yellow  colour. 

1219.  Quercitrine,  C33H30O17.  Quercitrine  is  the  glucoside  of 
quercitron,  the  bark  of  Quercus  tinctoria.  It  occurs  also  in  other 
plants,  such  as  in  sumach,  grape  vine,  and  in  catechu.  The  reaper  • 
substances  are  extracted  with  alcohol  and  the  tannin  precipitated  by 
means  of  gelatine  solution.  On  evaporating  the  filtrate  small  yellow 
crystals  of  quercitrine  are  obtained,  which  are  but  slightly  soluble  in 
hot  water.     Dilute  acids  split  up  quercitrine  into  isodulcit 

and  quercetine,  C27H18012  : 

^33^300!  7  +  H20  =  C6H1406  +  C27Hl8012. 

Quercetine  occurs  ready  formed  in  other  plants,  such  as  tea,  bark 
of  the  apple  tree,  <fcc.  Separated  from  its  solutions  it  forms  a  yellow 
crystalline  powder,  which  may  be  partially  sublimed  in  beautiful 
yellow  needles. 

It  is  readily  soluble  in  alcohol,  also  in  alkalies,  with  which  it  forms 
crystalline  compounds.  It  is  coloured  green  by  ferric  chloride.  Hot 
and  very  concentrated  alkali  solutions  decompose  it  into  phloro-glucine 
(§  1000)  and  querc  .  which  crystallises  in  fine  prisms,  and  by

roots  must  be  several  times  extracted  with  water,  and  then  with  alcohol, 
the  colour  removed  by  animal  charcoal,  and  the  filtrate  evaporated 
down  on  the  water  bath.  The  residue  is  then  treated  with  alcohol 
and  the  glucosides  precipitated  by  ether.

1 1  jo^i6»  andjaJapww,  C34H56016,  are  amorphous, 
colourless  and  odourless  masses,  slightly  soluble  in  water,  very  easily 
soluble  in  alcohol  and  in  dilute  acids,  not  at  all  in  ether ;  they  act  as 
purgatives.  <  >n  heating  they  fuse  (convolvuline  fuses  at  150°),  and 
are  decomposed  at  a  rather  higher  temperature.  They  are  dissolved 
by  strong  bases,  forming  the  salts  of  the  easily  soluble  acids  con- 
ilic  acid,  C31H52017,  and  jalapic  acid,  C34H58017.  These  acids 
are  most  easily  prepared  by  boiling  the  original  glucosides  with  baryta 
water,  and,  after  accurately  precipitating  the  barium  with  sulphuric 
acid,  evaporating  the  filtrate,  when  they  are  obtained  as  easily  soluble, 
amorphous  bodies,  nifltiuLT  a  little  above  100°.  The  salts,  whether  con- 
taining one  or  two  equivalents  of  metal,  are  also  amorphous. 

The  original  bodies  or  the  acids  are  decomposed  by  emulsin,  yielding 
sugar.     Convolvuline  gives  at  the  same  time  convolvulinol :

Poly,  to.,  but  especially  in  the  roots  of  Saponaria  offici- 

nalis. 

By  boiling  the  latter  with  alcohol  and  cooling  the  hot  filtrate  it 
is  obtained  in  colourless  amorphous  masses.  It  is  rather  soluble  in 
water,  forming  a  solution  which  behaves  like  soap  solution  when 
shaken ;  it  is  only  slightly  soluble  in  cold  alcohol,  not  at  all  in  ether. 
It  is  poisonous  and  its  dust  causes  violent  sneezing.  It  is  split  up  by 
Strong  HC1  into  an  uncrystalli>able  sugar  and  sapogenine,  C14H2204. 
The  latter  forms  white,  difficultly  soluble  crystals.

reprecipitated  by  water.  It  is  white,  amorphous,  easily  powdered,  and 
tastes  intensely  bitter.  On  heating  with  hydrochloric  acid  and  alcohol 
it  is  split  up  into  a  sugar  like  mannitan  and  chinovic  acid,  C24H3804, 
which  separates  as  a  shining  crystalline  powder  difficultly  soluble  <■ 
in  boiling  alcohol.  With  alkalies  and  ammonia  it  yields  easily  soluble 
salts,  from  which  the  voluminous  white  silver  salt,  C24H3GAg204,  may 
be  precipitated. 

1223.  Glycyrrhiziin  .  Cj4Hj609,  occurs  in  liquorice  root  IGlycyr-

is  then  precipitated  by  plumbic  acetate  and  the  precipitate  susj>ended 
in  water,  decomposed  by  sulphuretted  hydrogen.  On  evaporation  of 
the  solution  the  glycyrrhizineis  left  as  alight  yellow  amorphous  powder, 
which  at  first  tastes  sweet  and  afterwards  has  an  irritating  effect. 
Boiling  dilute  acids  decompose  it  into  a  sugar   and  glycyrrhetine, 

1224.  IleUeboreine,  C26H140,5,  is  obtained  from  the  roots  of 
1I<  Ueborua  nvjer,  and  also  from  //.  virifi*.  but  in  smaller  quantity,  in 
the  form  of  microscopic  colourless  needles,  readily  soluble  in  water, 
difficultly  in  alcohol.  On  boiling  with  dilute  acids  it  yields  sugar  and 
hslleboretine,  C|4H20O3,  which  is  at  first  violet  blue,  but  becomes 
greyish  green  after  drying. 

J/dleborine,  a  substance  crystallising  in  colourless  concentrically 
grouped  needles,  also  occurs  in  quantity  in  JlfUeborus  viridit,  but 
only  sparingly  in  //.  niger.  It  is  insoluble  in  water,  readily  soluble 
in  alcohol,  and  is  coloured  intensely  red  by  strong  sulphuric  acid. 
Boiling  dilute  acids  convert  it  into  sugar  and  aruoi-phons  heU 
C30H38O4.     Both  glucoside^  act  as  narcotics,  especially  heUeborine. 

1225.  Digitaime  is  the  hitter,  highly  poisonous  constituent  of 
DigitaUi  purpurea.  It  is  almost  insoluble  in  water,  readily  soluble 
in  alcohol  and  chloroform.  On  heating  with  concentrated  phosphoric 
and  hydrochloric  adds  it  gives  an  intense  green  colour;  lading  dilute 
sulphuric  acid  converts  it  into  sugar  and  resinous  <li<itt<th'>tine. 

AntiarmBf  OuH»0O  .  is  extracted  by  alcohol  from  the  Indian 
arrow  poison,  Upas  artfiar,  the  dried  milky  juice  of  AntiarU 
toxicaria,  and  is  obtained  on  evaporation  in  colourless  crystalline 
leaves,  melting  at  220°  ;  the  melted  mass  becomes  amorphous  on 
cooling.  Antiarine  is  soluble  both  in  water  and  ether,  and  when 
introduced  into  a  wound  it  aits  as  a  violent  poison.  It  is  split  up  by 
dilute  mineral  acids  into  sugar  and  a  resinous  body. 

1226.  Carminie  <ici</,  C17II18O10,  is  found  in  many  plants — for 
instance,  in  the  blossoms  of  Monarda  didyma — but  especially  in 
oochiru  e/,  the  female  of  Coccus  cacti.  The  pulverised  insects  must  be 
extracted  with  boiling  water,  the  filtrate  treated  with  plumbic  acetate, 
and  the  washed  precipitate  suspended  in  water  and  decomposed  by 
hydric  sulphide.  The  filtered  solution,  when  evaporated,  leaves  the 
acid  as  a  purple  red  amorphous  mass,  which  yields  with  bases  salts  of 
the  same  colour.  By  boiling  with  dilute  acid  it  yields  an  optically 
inactive  sugar,  which  is  amorphous  and  not  capable  of  fermentation, 
and  the  dark  purple  carmine  red,  CnH1207,  soluble  in  water  and 
alcohol.  Carmine  red  heated  with  strong  nitric  acid  yields  oxalic  acid 
and  nitrococcio  acid,  C18H;,(N02)303,  crystallising  in  yellow  tables, 
probably  a   trinitro-cresotic  acid  (§   1080).      Similar   valuable   red

Pin  lsoin  the  green  parts  of  Thuja  occidentalis.  It  is 
a  yellow  amorphous  bitter,  and  yields  sugar  and  ericinol  as  decomposi- 
tion products. 

Eric  1 1     ( ) 2 1, occurring  in  Ledum pallustre,  Erica  herbacea, 

Ac,  is  a  bitter  powder  which  also  splits  up  into  sugar  and  ericinol. 
Ericinol,  C10H16O,  is  a  colourless  oil  which  rapidly  darkens  in  air. 

1228.  Caincine,  from  the  roots  oiChiocca  racemosa,  crystallises  in 
difficultly  soluble  prisms.  Hydrochloric  acid  gas  decomposes  it  into 
an  amorphous  sugar  and  caincetifK  ,  <  1 1  ,  ,03,  and  fusion  with  potassic 
hydrate  converts  the   Latter  into  butyric  acid  and  cainceginine  : 

Amongsl  tl ther  numerous  vegetable  glucosides  it  isonly  neces- 
sary to  mention  the  amorphous,  insoluble  ajtiin- ,  from  Apiwn  petro-

Ground  mustard,  when  treated  with  boiling  alcohol  and  afterwards 
with  cold  water,  yields  to  the  latter  potassic  myronate : 

I      1 1   .  N  K  9jOi0. 

The  filtered  liquid,  after  evaporation  to  a  syrup,  yields  a  precipitate  of 
the  salt  on  addition  of  86  %  alcohol.  It  crystallises  in  silky  needles, 
and  is  quickly  converted  by  myrosine,  a  ferment  contained  in  mustard 
seeds,  into  grape  sugar,  oil  of  mustard,  and  bydric  potassic  sulphate  : 

C10H18NKS2O10  =  < .11 ._«»..  -  I     H,NCS  +  KHS04. 

The  aqueous  solution  of  the  salt,  treated  with  argentic  nitrate,  yields 
a  curdy  precipitate  of  t',11  ,XAgS204,  sugar  remaining  in  solution. 
By  decomposing  this  precipitate,  suspended  in  water,  by  sulphuretted 
hydrogen,  there  are  formed  argentic  sulphide,  sulphuric  acid,  free 
sulphur,  and  ally  lie  cyanide  : 

C4H5NAg2S204  +  HaS  =  Ag2S  +  H2S04  +  C3H5.CN  +  S. 

Myronio  acid  is  not  known  in  the  free  state,  as  it  decomposes  so  very 
quickly. 

Tannins. 

1230.  Probably  the  greater  number  of  the  so-called  tannins  belong 
to  the  vegetable  glucosides ;  indeed,  it  is  highly  probable  that  tannic 
acid,  from  galls,  exists  in  them,  to  some  extent  at  all  events,  in  the 
form  of  a  glucoside. 

All  tannins  show  the  following  characteristic  properties  : — They 
have  an  astringent  taste,  they  give  a  bluish  or  greenish  black  pre- 
cipitate with  feme  salts,  and  are  precipitated  by  gelatine  solutions  and 
animal  membranes,  especially  the  skin,  forming  leather.  Tannins 
exist  in  most  plants,  but  in  very  variable  quantities.  On  boiling  with 
dilute  acids   many  of  them   yield  sugar  and   red   amorphous   sub-

stances  which  are  insoluble  in  water,  but  soluble  in  alkalies  and  in 
alcohol. 

These  red  bodies  are  also  found  ready  formed  in  the  plant 
are  probably  the  cause  of  the  red  brown  colour  of  the  bark.  In 
order  to  obtain  tannin  the  vegetable  substances  must  be  extracted 
with  water,  the  filtered  solution  precipitated  with  neutral  or  1 
lead  acetate,  and  the  precipitate  decomposed  under  water.  On  evapora- 
tion of  the  clear  liquid  the  tannin  will  be  left  as  an  amorphous 
gummy  mass. 

All  tannins  yield  aromatic  compounds  when  their  decompositi-  n 
products  are  fused  with  potash ;  most  of  them  give  phloroglucin  and 
pro toca tech uic  acid. 

Oak-bark  tannin  gives  a  blue-black  colour  with  feme  salts;  on

1234.  Vi  ratrk  acid,  dimcthyl-protocatechuic  acid  : 

C9H10O4  =  C6H3(OCH3)2CO.OH, 

(comp.  §  1067,  2),  isomeric  with  evernic  and  umbellic  acids  (§  1087), 
is  nearly  allied  to  the  lichen  acids.  It  exists  in  sabadilla  seeds.  On 
extracting  the  seeds  with  alcohol  containing  sulphuric  acid  it  dissolves 
out  together  with  veratrine  sulphate  (vide  alkaloids).  After  precipi- 
tating the  sulphuric  acid  with  milk  of  lime  the  liquid  is  filtered  and

the  alcohol  distilled  off.  Veratrine  separates  out  and  the  calcium  salt 
of  veratric  acid  remains  in  solution.  The  acid  is  precipitated  by 
hydrochloric  acid  and  crystallised  from  alcohol.  It  forms  colourless 
prisms,  which  are  difficultly  soluble  in  water,  and  is  decomposed  by 
gently  warming  with  baryta  into  barium  carbonate  and  veratrol, 
C8H10O2,  a  substance  isomeric  with  hydrophlorone  and  beta-orcin, 
which  melts  at  15°  and  boils  at  205°. 

Ferulic  acid,  C10H10O4,  may  be  precipitated  as  lead  salt  from  the 
alcoholic  extract  of  assafcetida,  and  obtained  in  the  free  state  by 
treating  the  precipitate  with  alcohol  containing  sulphuric  acid.  It 
crystallises  in  long  colourless  needles,  melting  at  154°,  and  is  almost 
insoluble  in  water.  It  is  decomposed  by  potash  into  acetic  and  proto- 
catechuic  acids. 

Sinapic,  hemipinic,  opianic,  and  piperic  acids  will  be  described 
under  the  alkaloids,  of  which  they  are  decomposition  products.

1235.  Many  bodies  free  from  nitrogen  are  classed  in  this  group, 
of  which  the  constitution  is  at  present  unknown.  Many  of  them 
yield  metallic  compounds  with  strong  bases,  without,  however,  posses- 
sing definite  acid  properties.  As  many  of  them  may  be  transformed 
into  phenol-like  bodies  it  is  possible  that  the  production  of  these 
metallic  compounds  depends  on  the  presence  of  a  hydroxyl  group 
situated  as  in  phenol. 

1236.  1.  Morine,  C12H]0O6,  occurs  mixed  with  maclurine  in  fustic, 
the  wood  of  Morus  or  Maclaura  tinctoria.  The  boiling  aqueous  ex- 
tract deposits  morin  on  cooling,  but  the  maclurin  can  only  be  ob- 
tained by  evaporating  the  liquid.  They  may  be  purified  by  re- 
crystallisation  after  the  addition  of  a  little  hydrochloric  acid  to  remove 
calcium. 

Morine  crystallises  in  yellow  needles,  easily  soluble  in  alkalies, 
ammonia,  and  alcohol,  difficultly  soluble  in  water.  The  alcoholic 
solution  gives  a  green  colour  with  ferric  chloride.  The  ammoniacal 
solutions  yield  yellow  precipitates  with  calcium  chloride  and  lead 
acetate.     Morine  reduces  argentic  nitrate  at  ordinary  temperatures. 

Sodium  amalgam  and  water  converts  morin  into  phloroglucin. 
Fusing  with  potash  gives  the  same  result. 

2.  Maclurine,  C13H10O6,  forms  an  almost  colourless  crystalline 
powder.  It  gives  a  dark  green  precipitate  with  ferric  chloride. 
Melted  with  potash  it  yields  phloroglucin  and  protocatechuic  acid, 
and  gives  pyrocatechin  on  dry  distillation.  It  is  therefore  probably 
an  ethereal  compound  of  the  two  first : 

C6H3(OH)2.O.C6H3(OH).CO.OH. 

1237.  Catedtinc,  luteoline,  and  scoparine  yield  the  same  products 
as  maclurine  on  fusion  with  potash  and  on  dry  distillation. 

1.  Catechine,  C19H1808  (?).  That  portion  of  catechu  and  kino  in- 
soluble in  cold  water  is  extracted  with  boiling  water.  On  cooling  the 
solution  it  crystallises  out  in  colourless  silky  needles,  containing  water 
of  crystallisation,  which  after  drying  at  100°  melt  at  217°. 

2.  Luteoline,  C20H14O8,  contained  in  weld  (Reseda  hUeola),  forms 


SANTONINE.  729 

fine  yellow  needles,  which  melt  above  320°  and  sublime  partially  un- 
mposed.  It  is  only  slightly  soluble  in  water,  more  easily,  how- 
.  in  alcohol  and  in  alkalies,  to  which  latter  it  gives  a  deep  yellow 

colour. 

3.  Sooparime,  C21H22O10,  exists  in  Spartium  scoparium  together 

with  the  alkaloid  sparteine.     It  is  difficultly  soluble  in  cold  water, 

easily,  with  yellow  colour,  in  alkalies. 

1238.  At  te,  C24H30O7,  is  extracted  from  the  roots  and 
seeds  of  Athamamiha  On  o*  l.inum  by  means  of  ether,  and  remains  after 
evaporation  of  the  solvent  as  an  oil  which  rapidly  crystallises.     It 

illises  in  four-sided  needks  or  prisms,  melting  at  79°,  and  is  in- 
soluble in  water.  It  yields  crystalline  compounds  with  hydrochloric 
acid  and  sulphurous  anhydride.  The  former  decomposes  on  boiling 
with  water  into  free  hydrochloric  acid,  and  valerianic  acid,  and 
oreoselon  : 

C24H30O7  =  2C5H100,  +  C14H10O3  (oreoselon). 
Oreoselon  crystallises  in  colourless  needles,  difficultly  soluble  both 
in  alcohol  and  ether.     On  boiling  it  yields  oreoselin,  a  substance  easily 
soluble  in  water,  alcohol,  and  ether  : 

CMH10O3  +  H2O  =  CuH1204. 

1239.  Peucedanine,  C16Hlf)0,,  is  extracted  from  the  roots  of  Peuce- 
>m  officinale  and   /  rtnUhi/wn  by  means  of  alcohol, 

and    crystallises    in    small  1    prisms,  melting    at    81°-82°. 

Heated  with  hydrochloric  acid  it  yields  a  gas  burning  with  a  greenish 
flame  (probably  methyl  chloride)  and  oroselon,  C,4H1204,  melting  at 
177°.  Peucedanine  is  therefore  dimethyl  oroselon.  Oroselon  is  de- 
composed by  melting  potash  into  acetic  acid  and  resorcin. 

OstnUhine,  C14Hj702,  occurs  with  peucedanine  in  imperatoria 
root.  It  crystallises  from  alcohol  or  ether  in  rhombic  prisms, 
melting  at  115°.  Its  dilute  alcoholic  solutions  possess  a  sky-blue 
fluorescence. 

1240.  8a  C15H1803,  is  the  active  constituent  of  the 
blossoms  of  Artemiiia  Samtottiea.  It  is  obtained  by  mixing  the  sub- 
stance with  half  its  weight  of  quick-lime  and  extracting  the  mixture 
with  dilute  alcohol.  The  nitrate  is  evaporated  and  the  residue  boiled 
with  acetic  acid.  On  cooling  santonine  crystallises  out  in  lustrous 
six-sided  flat  prisms,  which  melt  at  168° -170°  and  possess  a  slight 
bitter  taste.  It  becomes  yellow  on  exposure  to  daylight.  It  is  quite 
insoluble  in  cold  water,  easily  soluble  in  alcohol  and  in  ether.  Heated 
in  a  stream  of  hydrogen  with  zinc  dust  it  yields  santonol,  C15H180, 
crystallising  in  colourless  needles  which  melt  at  135°. 

Santonine  dissolves  in  alkalies,  yielding  salts  of  santonic  acid.  The 
sodium  salt  is  2C,5H19Na04,6H20.  These  salts,  when  treated 
with  hydrochloric  acid  and  shaken  with  ether,  yield  santonic  acid  to 
the  latter.  It  crystallises  in  difficultly  soluble,  colourless  needles.  At 
120°  it  splits  up  into  water  and  santonine. 

The  insoluble  barium  salt  dissolves  on  prolonged  boiling  with 
baryta  water.  On  acidifying  and  extracting  with  ether  an  acid  is 
obtained  isomeric  with  the  one  just  described.  It  melts  at  161°- 
163°  without  decomposition,  and  cannot  be  reconverted  into 
santonine.

Kosine,  C31H38O10,  the  active  principle  of  the  kousso  plant,  crystal- 
lises in  yellow  needles  or  prisms,  melting  at  142°,  insoluble  in  water, 
but  readily  soluble  in  ether,  chloroform,  benzol,  or  boiling  alcohol. 
It  yields  a  hexacetate,  melting  at  135°,  when  heated  to  150°  with  acetic 
anhydride  : 

C3iH32(C2H3O)6O10. 

1241.  Aloine,  C17H1807,  is  obtained  from  the  dried  sap  of  the 
various  kinds  of  aloe  by  treatment  with  water  and  evaporation  of 
the  solution  in  vacuo.  It  forms  small  colourless  crystals,  having  a 
taste  both  bitter  and  sweet.  It  dissolves  with  difficulty  both  in 
alcohol  and  water,  and  on  warming  becomes  brown  and  amorphous. 
It  does  not  appear  to  possess  purgative  properties.  On  boiling  aloes 
with  dilute  sulphuric  acid  paracoumaric  acid  (§  1099,  2)  is  obtained. 
Aloes  treated  with  nitric  acid  yield,  first,  amorphous  alo'etic  acid : 

CHH4(N02)402, 
which  is  converted  by  the  further  action  of  the  acid  into  chrysammic 
acid,  C14H2(OH2)(N02)402  (§  1167,  5).    Fused  with  potash  aloes  yield 
alorcic  acid : 

C9II10O3,rI2O 

(which  crystallises  in  needles  melting  at  115°),  and  eventually  acetic, 
paraoxybenzoic,  and  oxalic  acids. 

1242.  Braziline,  C22H1807,  is  the  colouring  matter  obtained  from 
Brazil  wood.  When  quite  pure  it  is  perfectly  colourless ;  in  a  less 
pure  state,  however,  it  is  bright  yellow.  It  crystallises  in  needles. 
Its  solutions  in  water  or  alcohol  that  has  been  previously  boiled  are 
colourless,  but  they  soon  become  yellow  and  red.  It  dissolves  in 
alkalies,  giving  a  beautiful  carmine  red  solution ;  this  red  solution 
may  be  decolourised  by  warming  with  zinc  dust.  Its  colour  appears 
again,  however,  on  exposure  to  the  air. 

Braziline  yields  resorcin  (§  993)  on  dry  distillation.  When  boiled 
with  strong  nitric  acid  styphnic  acid  (§  1003)  is  formed. 

RaimatoxijUnr,  Ci6H1406,3H20  =  C,6H8(OH)6,3H20,  the 
colouring  matter  of  logwood  (Ihunwioxylon  Campechicmum)fcrjBtal- 
lises  from  water  or  ether  in  yellow  prisms  having  a  sweet  taste. 
Its  solutions  are  dextrorotatory.  Treated  with  acetyl  chloride  it 
yields  a  hexacetate,  C16H8(O.C3H30)6,  crystallising  in  silky  needles. 
It  dissolves  in  alkalies,  giving  a  purple  red  solution,  which  readily 
takes  up  oxygen.  The  ammonia cal  solution  rapidly  darkens  when 
exposed  to  the  air,  and  leaves  on  evaporation  hcemateine  ammonia, 
crystallising  in  dark  violet  crystals. 

The  solution  of  the  latter  yields  a  brown  red  precipitate  of 
herniate)' nc,  C16H1206,  when  treated  with  acetic  acid.  Haemate'ine 
mav  also  be  obtained  by  adding  a  little  nitric  acid  to  an  ethereal 
solution  of  haematoxyline.  It  crystallises  in  groups  of  needles  and 
contains  three  molecules  of  water  of  crystallisation.  Sulphurous  acid 
or  nascent  hydrogen  regenerates  haematoxyline  from  it.  Haematoxy- 
line fused  with  potash  yields  much  pyrogallic  acid  (§  999). 

1243.  Gentianine,  C14H,0O5,  is  extracted  from  the  roots  of 
Gentiana  lutea  by  means  of  ether.  It  forms  yellow,  tasteless  needles, 
insoluble  in  water,  soluble  in  alkalies,  giving  an  intense  yellow 
solution.

orange  colour  is  developed,  which  becomes  blue  on  subsequent  addition 
of  alkalies. 

Ettxanthine,  C19H16O10,  combined  with  magnesia  forms  the  prin- 
cipal constituent  of  purree,  an  East  Indian  yellow  colouring  matter. 
It  may  be  set  free  from  this  compound  by  means  of  hydrochloric 
acid  and  recrystallised  from  boiling  water.  It  forms  shining  yellow 
prisms,  and  is  difficultly  soluble  in  cold  water,  easily  in  alcohol  and 
ether.  It  forms  yellow  compounds  with  bases.  At  180°  it  de- 
composes, yielding  carbonic  anhydride,  water,  and  euxanthone  : 

Cl3H804. 

The  latter  crystallises  in  yellow  prisms,  which  are  soluble  in  hot  con-

violet  solution. 

Caroline,  C18H240,  is  the  red  colouring  matter  of  the  carrot  (Ban- 
cus  Carota),  in  the  cells  of  which  it  exists  in  red  microscopic  crystals. 
It  is  difficultly  soluble  even  in  boiling  alcohol.  It  crystallises  in 
red-brown  cubes,  melting  at  168°. 

1245.  Chrysine, C^H^O.,,  and  tectochrysine,  C16H1204,  existin  the 
buds  of  the  poplar.  Chrysine  crystallises  in  thin  blight  yellow  tables, 
melting  at  275°  and  capable  of  sublimation.  It  is  insoluble  in  water, 
difficultly  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether,  but  readily  in  alkalies  with 
yellow  colour.  Bromine  converts  it  easily  into  dibromo-chrysin,  strong 
nitric  acid  into  dinitro-chrysin,  C15H8(N02)204,  the  latter  of  which  is 
only  soluble  in  boiling  strong  acetic  acid. 

Tectochrysine,  which  can  be  separated  from  chrysine  by  solution  in 
benzol,  forms  large  sulphur  yellow  monoclinic  prisms,  melting  at  130°. 

Both  bodies  yield  acetic  acid,  phenyl-methyl  ketone  (§  1037),  and 
benzoic  acid  when  decomposed  by  boiling  with  highly  concentrated 
potash,  and  from  chrysine  phloroglucin  is  also  obtained.  They  are 
possibly  homologues  of  dihydroxy-anthraquinone  (§  1197).

Many  of  the  resins  occur  in  plants  dissolved  in  ethereal  oils. 
Should  the  vessels  which  contain  this  solution  be  injured,  it  flows  out 
and  becomes  thick,  or  even  solid,  on  exposure  to  the  air,  partly  from 
evaporation  of  the  solvent  oil  and  partly  by  its  oxidation.  Such

melting  at  149°,  boiling  at  about  320°,  and  is  thereby  converted  into 

ie  acid. 

1251  This  is  obtained  from  the  balsam  of  trees 
of  the  species  copaiba.  The  balsam  is  a  light  yellow  liquid  which  on 
distillation  with  water  yields  a  terpene  and  the  resin.  The  latter  is  a 
mixture  of  an  insoluble,  neutral  resin  and  copaibic  acid,  which  may 
be  obtained  in  transparent  prisms  by  evaporating  the  alcoholic  solution.

from  Ue.  In  the  state  of  powder  it  becomes  green 
on  exposure  to  air.  Its  alcoholic  solution  is  turned  blue  by  iodine. 
It  contains  several  constituents  of  a  feebly  acid  nature,  especially  the 
dib;i  If  ,,:04.  which  crystallises  from  acetic  acid 
in  needles.  It  melts  at  about  77^,  and  yields  >  'a,  C10H22O3, 
liquid  guiaool  .  and  cresol  (§  1016,  3),  on  submitting  it  to 
dry  distillation. 

yellowish  or  brownish  resin  having  a  conchoidal  fracture, 

is  obtained  from  varii  ..owing  in  the  East  and  West  Indies, 

and  also  in  Africa.    It  is  decomposed  on  fusion,  is  heavier  than  water, 

almost  insoluble  in  alcohol,  soluble  in  ether,  in  which  it  first  of  all 

Is  up.     Its  separate  constituents  have  not  yet  been  isolated. 


734  RESINS. 

Elemi  resin,  obtained  from  Amarya  <  l>  nvifera,  Amarys celonica 
is  usually  met  \\  ith  in  rather  a  soft  condition,  owing  to  the  presem 
an  ethereal  oil.     Cold  alcohol  extracts  an  amorphous  acid  resin  from 
it.     Treated  with  hot  alcohol  it  yields  a  colourless  crystalline  1  • 
amyrin,  C40H68O2,  melting  at  174°.     Amyrin  occurs  also  in  anime 
resin. 

1253.  Dammara  resin  is  very  similar  in  appearance  to  copal,  but 
fuses  without  decomposition  and  dissolves  in  boiling  alcohol. 

M<i$tic  is  the  resin  of  Piatada  Lentiscus,  a  tree  growing  in  the 
islands  of  the  Greek  archipelago.  It  occurs  in  small,  rounded, 
translucent  grains,  and  contains  several  constituents  soluble  in  varying 
degrees  in  alcohol. 

Olibanum,  or  incense,  is  obtained  from  a  Boswellia  growing  in 
Abyssinia.  It  occurs  in  rounded,  pale  yellow  grains,  which  on  melting 
diffuse  an  aromatic  perfume. 

Acaroid  resin  is  obtained  from  Xanthorhoea  hast  ilia,  a  tree  growing 
in  New  Holland.  It  yields  resorcin  when  treated  with  melting 
potash.  Nitric  acid  acts  on  it  very  readily,  yielding  picric  acid  in 
large  quantities. 

DfKjoris  blood,  the  resin  of  Calamus  Draco,  Dracaena  Draco,  and 
Pt>  rocarpus  Draco,  is  met  with  in  reddish  brown  fragments,  which 
yield  a  red  powder  and  dissolve  almost  entirely  in  alcohol  to  a  re  1 
solution. 

Gum  lac,  or  lac,  exudes  from  punctures  made  by  the  female  insects 
of  Coccus  lacca  in  twigs  of  several  East  Indian  trees.  It  is  met  with 
in  commerce  in  three  forms — stick  lac,  seed  lac,  and  shell  lac.  The 
first  consists  of  the  twigs  covered  with  resin,  the  second  is  the  resin 
separated  from  the  woody  substance,  and  the  third  has  been  purified 
by  melting.     The  colour  of  the  latter  is  derived  fooin  the  insects. 

Gum  I"  nzoin,  the  resin  of  Styrax  Benzoin,  occurs  in  large  brittle 
fragments  of  <  lit  fere  nt  shades  of  brown.  It  has  a  pleasant  odour,  re- 
sembling vanilla.  It  contains  benzoic  and  frequently  cinnamic  acids, 
together  with  some  resins  of  feebly  acid  character. 

1254.  .  I  mbi  r  is  a  fossil  resin  formed  in  many  peat  bogs,  and  consists 
chiefly  of  an  amorphous  substance  insoluble  in  alcohol,  oils,  and 
alkalies.  It  yields  succinic  acid  in  large  quantities  on  dry  distillation. 
Among  tin-  fossil  resins  may  be  mentioned  ozocerite,  consisting  of  a 
hydrocarbon  of  the  CnH2n  series;  JicJitelite,  nC4H7  ;  xyloretin,  found 
in  fossil  fir  wood;  and  asphaltmu. 

1255.  Among  the  balsams,  storax,  from  Styra  t  li>/  r,  con- 
taining styrol  (§  1042),  styracin  (§  1094),  and  cinnamic  acid,  V<  ru 
balsam  and  Tolu  balsam,  the  former  containing  cinnamein  and 
the  latter  yielding  toluene  on  dry  distillation,  have  been  already 
de.-rribed. 

Among  the  gum  retina  the  more  important  are  the  following:— 
gum    ammoniac,    euphorbium,  galbanum,  gambogi  : da.    and 

myrrh  ;  and  from  these  resorcin,  phloroglucin,  pa  raoxy  benzoic  acid,  and 
protocatechnic  acid  have  been  obtained. 

1256.  Caoutchouc  and  guttapercha  consist  of  the  dried  juices  of 
various  tropical  trees.    The  former  is  obtained  from  Siphonia  elaei 
Hevea  caoutchouc.  Arc,  the  latter  from  various  isonandras  growing  in 
the  East  Indies.

utcbouc  consists  mainly  of  a  hydrocarbon  of  the  formula 
n(',II:.  ;i  white  sul -stance  which  may  be  obtained  pure  by  treatment 
of  the  crude  substance  with  water,  alcohol,  and  alkalies  ;  the  residue 
is  then  dissolved  in  chloroform   and   precipitated  by   alcohol.     The 

jtanceealflo  occurring  in  raw  caoutchouc  are  albuminous  matters 
and  the  methyl  derivatives  of  darubose  (§  8/6). 

Raw  caoutchouc  softens  on  warming,  and  may  be  kneaded  and 
mixed  with  foreign  substances.  When  kneaded  with  sulphur  and 
heated,  vulcanised  caoutchouc  is  formed. 

Eaw  guttapercha  is  tolerably  hard  at  ordinary  temperatures,  but 
us  below  100°  and  may  also  be  vulcanised.  Its  principal  con- 
stituent La  a  hydrocarbon  of  the  formula  nC5H,,  which  may  be 
obtained  pure  by  treating  with  boiling  ether.  It  forms  a  white  powd.  r

Alkaloids. 

1257.  In  most  poisonous  plants  there  exist  certain  basic  sub- 
stances of  a  highly  poisonous  nature.  They  are  found  in  the  plant  in 
combination  with  acids,  and  have  been  called  albdoids.  They  all 
contain  nitrogen,  and  combine  with  acids,  forming  salts,  just  as  am- 
monia does.  Only  a  few  contain  no  and  these  are  generally 
capable  of  distillation.  As  a  rule  they  contain  oxygen,  are  not  vola- 
tile without  i  it  ion.  and  arc  crystallisable.  Their  basic 
properties  differ  widely.      They  are  mostly  soluble  with  difficulty  in 

•r,    more   readily   in   a!  ber,    amy]    alcohol,    chloroform, 

benzene,  *vc.  They  generally  posaoao  a  bitter  taste,  and  very  many  of 
them  are  optically  active. 

In  order  to  prepare  them  the  plants  are  usually  extracted  with 

er  or  dilute  mineral  acids,  and  the  solution  treated  with  ammonia 
or  other  strong  base.  The  volatile  alkaloids  may  then  be  distilled  off 
in.  while  the  nonvolatile  on<-s  are  precipil 

A-  a  role  several  alkaloids  are  contained  in  the  same  plant  to- 
gether with  other  substances,  so  that  their  isolation  is  frequently  a 
troublesome  and  tedious  matter. 

All  alkaloids  are  precipitated  by  phospho-molybdic  acid  and  by 
the  double  iodides  of  potassium  with  mercury  and  cadmium.  Many 
of  them  may  be  precipitated  by  a  solution  of  iodine  in  iodide  of 
potassium  ami  by  platinic  and  auric  chlorides. 

Volatile  Alkaloids  containing  no  Oxygen. 

1258.  Conine,  C8H15N  =  CgHH  :]STH,  occurs  in  hemlock  (Conium 
ulatum).     To  obtain  it  the  crushed  seeds  are  distilled  with  dilute 

potash,  the  distillate  neutralised  with  sulphuric  acid  and  evaporated 
to  a  syrup.  On  addition  of  alcohol  ammonium  sulphate  is  precipi- 
tated ;  the  nitrate  is  evaporated  and  then  distilled  with  concentrated 
potash.  The  oily  conine  which  floats  on  the  watery  distillate  is 
separated,  and  allowed  to  remain  in  vacuo  for  some  time  to  remove 
ammonia,  and  finally  purified  by  distillation. 

Conine  is  a  colourless,  highly  poisonous  oil,  having  the  odour  of 
hemlock.  It  boils  at  168°  and  its  sp.  gr.  at  0°  is  0*886.  It  mixes  in 
all  proportions  with  alcohol  and  ether.     Tt  is  dextrorotatory,  dissolves

in  100°  parts  of  water,  giving  a  strongly  alkaline  solution.  W 
dissolves  in  it  to  a  slight  extent,  more  being  dissolved  by  the  cold 
substance  than  when  it  is  warm.  It  is  monobasic  and  yields  crystal- 
line, generally  deliquescent  salts,  which  oxidise  when  exposed  to  air, 
becoming  brown  at  the  same  time.  The  hydrochloride  has  the 
formula  C8H14  :  NH2C1. 

With  iodides  of  the  alcohol  radicals  it  yields  crystalline  compounds. 
With  ethyl  iodide  the  substance  produced  is  C8H14  :  N(C2H5).HI. 

These  compounds  are  decomposed  by  alkalies,  the  iodides  being 
regenerated.  They  are  capable  of  uniting  with  yet  another  molecule 
of  the  iodides,  forming  salts  of  the  general  formula  C8H14N(R)2I, 
which  are  not  decomposed  by  alkalies,  but  yield  caustic  bases  with 
freshly  precipitated  argentic  hydrate.  The  ethyl  compound  has  the 
composition  08Hi4N(C2H5)20H.  This  behaviour  on  the  part  of 
conine  shows  that  it  contains  the  imide  group  (§  265). 

On  oxidation  with  nitric  acid  or  chromic  acid  conine  yields  normal 
butyric  acid.  Treated  with  nitrous  anhydride  and  subsequently  with 
water,  it  yields  azoconydrin,  C8H16N20,  a  yellowish  oil,  which  yields 
a  homologue  of  acetylene,  allylene,  <fcc ,  on  treatment  with  phosphoric 
pentoxide.  This  substance  is  named  conylene  =  C8H14;  it  boils  at 
126°  and  combines  with  bromine,  producing  conylene  dibromide  : 

Methyl  conine,  C8H14  :  N.CH3,  occurs,  together  with  conine,  in  the 
seeds  of  the  hemlock.  Conylrln,  r8H17NO,  is  also  present ;  it  i-  a 
crystalline,  strongly  basic  alkaloid,  melts  at  121°  and  boils  at  240°. 
It  is  converted  by  phosphoric  anhydride  into  conine. 

Paraconine,  C8H15  :  N,  isomeric  with  conine,  is  obtained  by  heating 
dibutyraldin  (§§  424  and  763),  isomeric  with  conydrin,  with  a  small 
quantity  of  alcohol  to  between  130°  and  180°.  It  is  very  similar  to 
conine,  but  is  not  an  imide  base,  as  it  does  not  yield  an  analogous 
compound  to  that  obtained  from  conine  on  treatment  with  the  iodide 
of  an  alcohol  radical.  It,  however,  yields  the  iodide  of  an  ammonium 
base,  from  which  the  hydrate  may  l>e  prepared  by  the  action  of 
argentic  hydrate. 

1259.   fift  j0HuN„  the  alkaloid  of  tobacco,  in  the  leaves 

and  seeds  of  which  it  exists,  may  be  isolated  similarly  to  conine.  It 
is  purified  by  distilling  from  quick-lime  in  a  stream  of  hydrogen. 

Nicotine  is  a  colourless  liquid  which  turns  brown  on  exposure  to 
air.  It  is  soluble  in  alcohol,  ether,  and  water.  Its  specific  gravity  is 
1  -048  and  vapour  density  5*618.  The  odour  is  similar  to  that  of 
tobacco.  It  yields  difficultly  cryBtalliaable  salts  with  acids.  The 
hydrochloride  is  C10HUNS.2HC1.  The  iodide  unites  with  iodine, 
forming  a  difficultly  soluble,  crystalline  peiiodide.  The  haloid  salts 
yield  well-crv>tallised  double  salts  with  haloid  metallic  derivative-  :

Free  nicotine  also  forma  compounds  with  haloid  salts  of  metals; 
C10H14N2.3HgCl2,  C10H14N2.HgI2,  &c. 

If  bromine  be  added  to  an  ethereal  nicotine  solution,  a  compound 
having  the  formula  C10H12Br.2N2.HBr.Br2  is  formed,  which  on  boiling 
with  w^ater  or  alcohol  gives  up  two  atoms  of  bromine  and  yields  a  salt 
of  dibromonicotine.     The  base  C10H12Br2N2  is  precipitated  by   am-

properties. 

Nicotine  is  a  nitrile  base,  as  its  compounds  with  the  iodides  of 
alcohol  radicals  yield,  on  treatment  with  argentic  hydrate,  strongly 
caustic,  nonvolatile  bases,  C10Hu(C2H5)2N2(OrI)2. 

When  oxidised  by  chromic  acid  it  yields  an  amidated  acid, 
(II  N «  > ,,  which  distilled  from  lime  gives  rise  to  an  oily  base,  C5H5N, 
soluble  in  water.     The  latter  is  pyridine.

alkaline,  and  resembles  nicotine  in  its  compounds.  Like  nicotine,  it 
is  a  nitrile  base.

1261.  Opium,  the  dried  juice  of  the  poppy  (Papaver  somniferum), 
contains  a  large  number  of  crystalline  alkaloids,  mostly  combined  with 

oic  acid  (^  943),  in  addition  to  resins  and  other  substances.     The 

known  among  the  ilkaloidfl  are  morphine,  codeine,  thebaine, 
papaverine,  narcotine,  and  narceine.

off,  the  tiitrat  •  concentrated  by  evaporation  and  left  to  crystallise. 

hydrochlorides  of  morphine  and  codeine  then  crystallise  out; 
they  are  oolle  ml  then  decomposed  by  the  addition  of 

ammonia.  Morphine  i-  precipitated,  the  filtrate  concentrated  by 
evaporation,  and  codeine  precipitated  by  means  of  concentrated  pota-h, 
which  retains  in  solution  any  morphine  which  is  still  present.  The 
dark  brown  mother  liquors  from  lx>th  alkaloids  are  then  made  alkaline 
and  supersaturat-  d  with  ammonia.  A  precipitate  of  narcotine,  papa- 
verine, and  thebaine  is  obtained,  while  narceine  and  meconine  remain 
in  solution.  The  filtrate  i>  treated  with  plumbic  acetate,  the  pre- 
cipitate filtered  off,  and  the  filtrate  treated  with  sulphuric  acid  to 
remove  lead  ;  on  saturating  the  filtrate  from  the  lead  sulphate  with 
ammonia,  and  then  evaporating,  narceine  crystallises  out.  Meconine 
remains  in  solution,  and  may  be  obtained  by  shaking  the  solution  with 
ether. 

The  crystalline  magma,  consisting  of  narcotine,  papaverine,  and 
thebai'ne,  contaminated  with  some  resin,  after  being  repeatedly 
washed  with  water,  is  boiled  with  alcohol ;  narcotine  and  papa- 
verine separate  out  on  cooling.  The  mixture  of  the  two  is  then 
treated  with  concentrated  potash,  which  is  diluted  with  water  after 
standing  some  time;  narcotine  remains  undissolved.  The  alkaline 
mother  liquors  are  then  neutralised,  evaporated  to  dryness,  and  treated 
with  acetic  acid,  which  dissolves  the  papaverine.  It  can  now  be  pre- 
cipitated by  ammonia  from  the  solution.

738  ALKALOIDS. 

The  alcoholic  solution  containing  thebame  is  evaporated  and  the 
residue  taken  up  with  hot  acetic  acid.  There  still  remain  small 
quantities  of  narcotine,  papaverine,  and  resin,  which  are  precipitated 
out  by  plumbic  acetate,  the  filtrate  treated  with  sulphuric  acid  to 
remove  lead.  Thebaine  may  be  precipitated  from  the  filtered  liquid 
by  ammonia. 

If  it  be  necessary  to  isolate  only  morphine  and  narcotine,  the 
opium  is  treated  with  dilute  alcohol  until  nothing  more  Is  dissolved, 
and  the  bases  precipitated  by  ammonia,  leaving  the  whole  to  stand  for 
some  time.  The  narcotine  may  now  be  separated  from  the  morphine 
by  means  of  potash,  in  which  the  former  is  insoluble,  the  latter 
soluble.  The  morphine  is  precipitated  from  the  solution  on  addition 
of  ammonium  carbonate. 

The  separated  alkaloids  are  finally  purified  by  recrystallising  them 
either  in  the  free  state  or  in  the  form  of  salts.

Concentrated  sulphuric  acid  at  180°  converts  it  into  rufiopin 
(§  1169,  2). 

Hemipinic  add,  C10H10O6,  crystallises  from  hot  water  in  four- 
sided  prisms  capable  of  sublimation,  and  which  contain  varying 
amounts  of  water  of  crystallisation.  It  forms  acid  and  neutral  salts,

ter  with  quinic  and  quinotannic  acid  and  cinchona  red  (§  1230). 

The  calisaya  bark  contains  the  most  alkaloids,  between  2  and 
3  per  cent,  of  quinine  and  perhaps  a  tenth  of  that  quantity  of  cin- 
ehonine. 

The   bark  of  China  II  however,  contains   about    2^  per 

cent,  of  cinchonine  and  about  0*8  per  cent,  of  quinine.  In  many 
cinchona  barks  the  alkaloid-  in  largest  quantity  are  quinidino 

and  cinchonidine,  isomeric  with  those  above  mentioned. 

In  order  to  isolate  the  bases  the  pulverised  bark  must  be  extracted 
with  very  dilute  hydrochloric  acid,  and  the  filtrate  precipitated  with 
soda.  The  alkaloids  may  then  be  extracted  from  the  pressed  pre- 
cipitate by  boiling  alcohol  and  separated  by  conversion  into  sulphates, 
that  of  quinine  being  the  most  difficultly  soluble,  or  by  means  of 
ether,  which  does  not  dissolve  cinchonine.  The  alkaloids  may  be  pre- 
cipitated in  the  colour!.  by  addition  of  ammonia  to  solutions 
of  their  salts  previously  decolourised  by  animal  charcoal.  Long 
heating  with  excess  of  acid  must  be  carefully  avoided,  or  the  alka- 
loids will  be  converted  into  resinous  isomers,  quinicine,  and  cin- 
chonicine. 

1268.  Quinine,  CV  II  X  '\„3H20,  is  precipitated  from  its  salts 
as  a  white  powder.  It  crystallises  from  ether  or  chloroform  in 
colourless  needles,  which  lose  their  water  of  crystallisation  on  heating 
and  eventuallv  fuse  into  a  resinous  mass.     It  dissolves  in  about  900

dissolve  it. 

It  is  very  easily  -oluble  in  alcohol,  and  the  solution  is  laevorota- 
tory.  It  has  an  alkaline  reaction  and,  like  its  salts,  an  intensely 
bitter  taste.     It  combines  with  one  or  two  equivalents  of  acid,  the

Quinine   sulj.-  .   crystallises   from    hot 

water  in  needles  containing  7£  molecules  of  water.  It  is  efflorescent. 
From  alcohol  it  crystallises  with  2H.-0.  It  is  the  salt  of  quinine 
most  used  as  a  febrifuge.  It  is  easily  dissolved  by  dilute  sulphuric 
acid,  forming  Qtaining  only  half  the  quinine  that  the  other 

rHjO;  this  crystallises  in  transparent  four- 
ras  to  a  solution  having  a  blue  fluorescence. 
It  is  soluble  in  11  time-  .lit  of  water. 

The  neutral  sulphate  is  also  readily  soluble  in  acetic  acid,  and 
yields,   on  addition  of  iodine  solution,  quinine  sulphate  dUodide,  or

colourless  by  transmitted  light,  but  exhibit  a  fine  beetle  green  colour

Quinine  forms  crystalline  compounds  with  iodides  of  alcohol 
radicals  which  are  nut  decomposed  by  alkalies,  but  yield  caustic  alky  1- 
quinine  hydrates  when  decomposed  by  argentic  hydrate.  It  is  there- 
fore a  nitrilr  base.  With  the  chlorides  of  the  acid  radicals  anhydrous 
quinine  yields  hydrochlorides  of  quinine  salts,  from  which  the  latter 
may  be  precd]  aniorphou>  masses.     Benzoyl-quimne  has  the 

formula  CMHM(C7H80 

If  chlorine  water  be  added  to  a  quinine  solution,  and  afterwards 
ammonia,  an  emerald  green  colour  is  developed;  ferrocyanide  of  potas- 
sium and  ammonia  give  a  deep  red  colour. 

1269.   Ci  .  «      11     X20,  is  precipitated  from  solutions  of 

i Its  in  an  earthy  condition;  it  is.  however,  readily  obtained  in 
shining  prisms  by  crystallising  from  alcohol.  It  is  less  soluble  in 
alcohol  and  water  than  quinine,  is  quite  insoluble  in  ether,  and  is 
dextrorotatory.  Its  salts  correspond  to  those  of  quinine,  but  are 
more  readily  soluble  in  water.  Chloro-substitution  products  are  ob- 
tained on  addition  of  chlorine  water  and  ammonia  in  form  of  a  yellow 
precipitate.  If  bromine  be  added  to  the  hydrochloride  of  cinchonine, 
and  the  resulting  salt  of  dibromo-cinchonine  decomposed  by  ammonia, 
the  brominated  compound  C20H22Br2N2O  is  formed ;  on  boiling  this 
dibromo-cinchonine  with  potash  oxy cinchonine  C20H24N2O2  is  pro- 
duced. Although  this  substance  has  the  same  composition  as  quinine 
it  differs  markedly  from  it  in  its  properties. 

Acetate  of  cinchonine  dissolved  in  alcohol  yields,  when  treated 
with  sodium  amalgam,  colourless  scales  of  dihydro-cinchonine  :

and  amorphous  tetrahydro-cinchonine,  (J2oH28N20.

1270.  A  dark  brown  amorphous  mass,  called  quin&idme,  is  obtained 

from  the  last  mother  liquors  of  quinine  and  cinchonine ;  from  it  the 
two  alkaloids  quinidine  and  /3-cinchonine  have  been  prepared. 

Quinidine,    CgoH^N^O^H^O,    which    occurs    in   quantity   in 
pitayochina,  crystallises  from  alcohol  in  large  efflorescent  prisms,  melt- 
ing at  168°.     Like  quinine  it  gives  a  green  solution  with  ammonia 
and  chlorine  water.     Quinidine  salts  are  more  easily  soluble  in  v. 
than  those  of  quinine. 

Ciuchonidine,  C20H24N2O,  is  found  more  especially  in  Bogata- 
china.  It  forms  large  glassy  crystals,  the  solution  of  which  is  laevo- 
rotatory.  fi-Cinchonine,  C20H24N2O,  occurs  with  quinidine  in  quin- 
o'ldine  and  is  dextrorotatory. 

1271.  On  heating  the  sulphates  of  the  quinia  alkaloids  with  a 
little  nitric  acid  to  130°  they  yield  salts  of  two  resinous  amorphous 
bases.  Quinicine  is  obtained  from  quinine  and  quinidine,  while  cin- 
chonine and  cinchonidine  yield  citichonicine.  They  are  isomeric  with 
the  bases  from  which  they  are  produced. 

In  some  cinchona  barks  the  following   alkaloids  occur  : — 
Quinamine,  C20H26N2O2  \    paytine,   C2iH24N.,00  ;    and  or 
CMH,6N204. 

1272.  A  homologous  series  of  bases,  the  chinolvne  bates,  are  pro- 
duced by  dry  distillation  of  quinine,  cinchonine,  and  their  isomers 
with  potash.  They  are  also  products  of  the  dry  distillation  of 
coal. 

Chinoline,  C9H-N,    boils   at    238°. 
Lepidine,    C10H9N  „         269°-271°. 

Cryptidine,  CnlinN       „         about  274°. 

They  are  nitrile  bases,  as  their  alkyl-iodo  compounds  are  only 
decomposed  by  silver  oxide;  they  then  yield  caustic  ammonium 
hydrate  bases.  With  acids  they  form  neutral  salts  easily  soluble  in 
water. 

Their  amyl-iodo  compounds  when  heated  with  potash  yield  tabular 
crystals  having  a  tine  beetle-green  lustre.  Bolable  in  alcohol  without 
decomposition.  They  are  blue  colouring  matters  and  have  beeD

1273.  Bases  from  Strychnos. — In  different  varieties  of  Strychnos, 
especially  in  the  seeds  of  S.  nux  vomica  and  8.  Ignatii  (St.  Ignatius 
bean),  two  extremely  bitter  and  poisonous  alkaloids  occur — strychnine, 
C21H22N202,  and  brucine,  ('-{H 26N204. 

In  order  to  prepare  them  the  seeds  axe  boiled  with  concentrated 
alcohol,  dried,  powdered,  and  repeatedly  extracted  with  dilute  alcohol. 
The  alcohol  is  evaporated  from  the  extract  and  the  aqueous  residue 
precipitated  with  plumbic  acetate,  the  lead  removed  from  the  filtrate 
with  sulphuretted  hydrogen  and  the  bases  precipitated  from  the  clear 
solution  by  addition  of  magnesia.     After  standing  for  eight  days  the

precipitate  is  treated  with  cold  alcohol  to  remove  brucine,  and  the 
strychnine,  which  is  nearly  insoluble  in  that  solvent,  recry stall ised 
from  boiling  spirits  of  wine. 

1.  Strychnine,  C21H22N202,  forms  colourless  tetragonal  prisms, 
which  are  nearly  insoluble  in  water,, absolute  alcohol,  and  ether,  but 
more  readily  dissolved  by  hot  aqueous  alcohol,  benzene,  or  chloroform. 
The  solutions  are  optically  laevorotary.  The  crystallisable  salts,  e.g. 
the  nitrate,  C\21H22N202.HN03,  which  crystallises  in  tufts  of  needles, 

ily  in  water,  at  least  when  hot,  and  on  addition  of 
ammonic  sulphocyanate  give  a  crystalline  precipitate  of  strychnine 
sulphocyanate.  Strychnine  dissolves  in  cold  sulphuric  acid,  forming 
a  colourless  liquid,  which  on  addition  of  potassic  dichroniate  yields  a 
beautiful  bluish  violet  coloration.  Strychnine  chromate,  which  is 
insoluble  in  water,  shows  this  reaction  when  treated  with  sulphuric 
acid. 

2.  Brudn  .  <'.,!!_  N_(  >;.  I W  J  >,  crystallises  in  plates  or  prisms,  is 
less  poisonous  than  strychnine,  and  more  readily  in  water 
and  alcohol,  yielding  lsBvorotary  solutions.  Concentrated  nitric  acid 
colours  strychnine  first  red,  then  yellow.  On  addition  of  stannous 
chloride  the  colour  changes  to  deep  violet.  On  heating  brucine  with 
manganic  oxide  and  sulphuric  acid  methylic  alcohol  distils  over. 

1274.  Ba$69/rom  Veratrum, — Sabadilla  seeds  (from  V.  SabadiBa) 
contain  a  veratrine  salt  of  veratric  acid;  hellebore  (from  V.  album) 
contains  veratrine  and  jervine.  The  procedure  for  preparing  these 
alkaloids  is  similar  to  that  for  strychnine  and  brucine,  the  separation 
of  the  two  alkaloids  being  effected  by  dilute  sulphuric  acid,  which 

readily  soluble  salt  with  veratrine,  that  of  jervine  being 
difficultly  soluble. 

1.1  11 52N208,  is  obtained  either  as  a  light  powder  or 

as  prisms  whi  we  in  air.     It  melts  at  115°  and  solidifies  on 

cooling  to  us  mass.     It  dissolves  readily  in  alcohol  and  ether, 

but  is  nearly  insoluble  in  water.  When  a  trace  is  brought  into  con- 
tact with  the  nose  it  causes  violent  sneezing ;  when  swallowed  it  acts 
as  a  violent  poison.    It  dissolves  in  sulphuric  acid,  the  solution  having 

How  colour,  which  slowly  becomes  blood  red,  the  same  change 
being  effected  quickly  on  heating.  It  unites  with  one  equivalent  of 
acid  to  form  salts  that  are  in  part  crystallisable. 

2.  •/  <0H46N2O3,2H2O,  forms  prisms,  insoluble  in  water, 

readily  soluble  in  alcohol,  and  with  acids  yields  salts  which  arc 
generally  soluble. 

1275.  Berberine  and  oxyacanthine  occur  in  the  roots  of  Berberis 
vulgaris,  the  first  in  numerous  other  plants  also,  such  as  Colombo  root, 
in  different  menispermia  and  ranunculacese. 

Berberine,  C20H17NO4,6H2O,  forms  yellow  needles ;  it  melts,  when 
anhydrous,  at  120°,  is  soluble  in  water,  and  gives  yellow  crystalline 
salts  with  acids,  which  are  precipitated  from  their  solutions  by  addition 
of  an  excess  of  acid.  Nascent  hydrogen  converts  it  into  hydroberberine, 
C20H21NO4,  forming  small  crystals  of  adamantine  lustre,  reoxidised 
by  nitric  acid  to  berberine. 

Oxyacanthine,  C32H46N2On  (1),  crystallises  from  ether  in  colourless 
prisms,  turning  yellow  on  exposure  to  light. 

1276.  Piperine,  C17H10!SrO3,  the  alkaloid  of  the  different  kinds  of

pepper,  is  best  prepared  from  white  pepper.  This  is  extracted  with 
alcohol,  the  solvent  evaporated,  the  extract  washed  with  water,  lime 
or  potash  added,  and  the  result  again  extracted  with  alcohol.  On 
evaporation  pipeline  crystallises.  It  forms  colourless  tetragonal  plates, 
destitute  of  odour  or  taste,  is  insoluble  in  water,  readily  soluble  in 
alcohol  or  ether.  The  alcoholic  solution  has  a  sharp  peppery  taste. 
The  salts  of  piperine  are  decomposed  by  water. 

On  boiling  with  alcoholic  potassic  hydrate  it  splits  up  into  piperic 
acid  and  piperidine. 

Piperidine,  C5HnN  =  C5H10  :NH,  is  a  strongly  alkaline  liquid, 

miscible  with  water  and  alcohol.    It  boils   at  106°  and  has  vapour 

density  2"97.     It*  salts  crystallise  well.     Heated  at  300°  for  several 

hours  with  concentrated  sulphuric  acid  it  yields  pyridine  (§  892).     It 

unites  with  the  alkyl  iodides,  forming  alkyl-piperidine  iodides,  from 

which  the  alkyl -piperidines  can  be  separated   as   strongly   alkaline 

-  which  can  be  distilled.    Methyl  1  1 1      :  X.<  H3,  boils 

at   118°,  ethyl  piperidine  at    128°.     These  again   unite   with  alkyl 

iodides  to  form  salts,  from  which  the  caustic,   non-volatile  dialkyl 

piperidinammonic   hydrates  can  only  be   obtained  by  the   action  of 

itic  hydrate.     With  benzoyl  chloride  piperidine  yields  crystalline

•      H10O4  =  CH2  q,C6H3.C4H4.CO.OH,  is  obtained 

by  addition  of  hydrochloric  acid  to  the  i  nit;  it  a 

from  alcohol  in  clear  yellow  interlaced  needles,  melts  at  216°,  and  is 
nearly    insoluble   in   water.     With   bromine  it    yields  piperic   cci<1 
il]0Br4O4,  which  on  heating  with  dilute  solution  of 
hydrate   yields   piperonal   (§    1034),   as   does  also   pot 
piperate  when  distilled  with  pot;  manganate.     On  fusing  with 

potassic  hydrate    piperic  acid    is  decomposed    into    potassic  ace- 
ox.  date,    carbonate,   and    protocatechuate.     It   unites   with   nascent 
hydrogen!  forming

oxidises  on  exposure  to  air,  as  do  also  the  aqueous  solution  of  its  salts. 

1279.  Cocaine,  C17H21N04,  the  alkaloid  of  the  leaves  of  Ery- 
throxylon  Coca,  crystallises  in  monoclinic  prisms  and  melts  at  98°.  On 
heating  with  hydrochloric  acid  it  splits  up  into  benzoic  acid,  methylic 
alcohol,  and  an  alkaloid  ecgonine,  C9H15N03.  This  latter  is  readily 
soluble  in  water,  insoluble  in  ether,  and  crystallises  with  one  molecule 
H20  in  shining  prisms,  melting  at  198°. 

Colchicine,  C17H19N05,  occurs  in  all  parts  of  Colchium  autumnah  ; 
it  is  amorphous,  soluble  in  water  and  alcohol,  and  possesses  a  sharp 
and  bitter  taste.  It  melts  at  140°,  is  very  poisonous,  and  scarcely 
jses  basic  properties. 

Solanine,  C42H87N016,  occurs  in  various  solonaceous  plants,  and 
especially  in  potatoes  that  have  sprouted  in  the  dark.     It  is  extracted

by  dilute  sulphuric  acid,  and  on  quick  precipitation  of  the  filtrate  with 
ammonia  and  recrystallisation  of  the  precipitate  from  boiling  alcohol 
is  obtained  in  silky  prisms,  melting  at  235°,  of  weak  basic  properties 
and  nearly  insoluble  in  water ;  its  salts  are  gummy.  Even  traces  of 
it  impart  a  fine  red  colour  to  a  warm  mixture  of  alcohol  and  sulphuric 
acid.  Solanine  is  a  glucoside  alkaloid,  as  on  boiling  with  dilute 
mineral  acids  it  takes  up  water  and  decomposes  into  sugar  and  the 
more  strongly  basic  solanidine,  C26H41N02.  The  latter  crystallises 
in  fine  needles,  melts  at  200°,  and  can  be  sublimed  without  much 
decomposition.     Its  salts  crystallise  readily. 

1280.  The  seeds  of  Peganum  harmala,  a  plant  growing  on  the 
Russian  steppes,  contain  harmaline,  C13H14N20,  crystallising  in 
rhombic  pyramids,  and  harmine,  C13H12N20,  crystallising  in  shining 
prisms,  and  which  can  also  be  prepared  by  oxidation  of  the  former. 
They  are  both  monacid  bases. 

Of  other  alkaloids  there  may  be  mentioned — 

Aconitine,  C30H47NO7,  from  monk's  hood  (Aconitum  Xapellus). 

Bebeerine,  C19HnN03,  in  the  bark  of  Xectandra  Rodiei. 

Chelidonine,  C19H17N04,  and  chelerythrine,  C19H17N303,  in 
Chelidonium  majus. 

Curarine,  contained  in  the  South  American  arrow  poison. 

Delphinine,  C24H35N02,  in  Delphinium  Staphisagria,  and  finally 
caffeine  and  theobromine,  which  have  been  already  described  (§  931). 

Bile  Derivatives. 

1281.  The  gall  bladder  of  animals  contains  a  green  or  brown 
liquid,  of  faint  alkaline  reaction  and  bitter  taste.  This  has  been 
formed  in  the  liver,  and  contains,  in  addition  to  mucus,  choline,  leci- 
thine,  fatty  soaps,  and  paralactic  acid,  the  sodic,  or  more  rarely  the 
potassic,  salts  of  the  bile  acids,  cholesterine,  and  the  bile  pigment*.  The 
latter  and  cholesterine  occur  at  times  so  richly  in  the  liver  that  they 
crystallise  out  in  the  gall  bladder  and  form  gall  stones. 

Bile  Acids. 

1282.  In  the  bile  of  most  animals  Vwo  bile  acids  are  found,  which 
arc  both  monobasic  and  contain  nitrogen,  but  only  ono  contains 
sulphur.  On  boiling  with  acids  or  alkalies  the  two  acids  from  the 
same  animal  yield  the  nitrogen-free  acid,  cholic  acid j  in  the  case  of 
the  bile  acid  free  from  sulphur,  glycocholic  acid,  glycine  (§  717)  is  also 
obtained,  whilst  from  the  sulphur-containing  acid,  taurocholic  acid, 
the  second  product  is  taurine  (§  528).  All  bile  acids,  even  when 
present  in  very  small  quantity,  give  l  Pettenkofer's  reaction,7  i.e.  a 
beautiful  purple  coloration,  on  addition  of  a  little  sugar  and  then  of 
concentrated  sulphuric  acid.  This  coloration  occurs  most  readily  at 
about  60°. 

The  alkali  salts  occurring  in  the  bile  are  readily  soluble  in  water 
and  alcohol,  but  insoluble  in  ether.  In  order  to  obtain  them  in  a 
state  of  purity  the  bile  is  mixed  with  so  much  animal  charcoal  that, 
on  evaporating  to  dryness  on  the  water  bath,  a  dry  powder  remains, 
from  which  absolute  alcohol  extracts  the  now  colourless  salt  of  the 
bile   acids,  together  with  cholesterine,  choline,  lactic  acid,  <fcc.     On

addition  of  ether  containing  some  water,  the  salts  of  the  bile  acids  are 
precipitated  as  a  colourless  plaster-like  mass,  which  crystallises  on  long 
standing  in  the  liquid  and  forms  the  crude  material  for  preparing  the 
acids. 

The  acids  of  ox  gall  have  been  best  investigated  ;  they  occur  also 
in  the  bile  of  man,  of  the  dog,  and  of  most  animals  that  have  been 
investigated  as  yet,  the  proportion  of  the  sulphurised  acid  to  that 
free  from  sulphur  generally  differing.  They  are  designated  by  the 
name  given  above. 

1283.  GlycochoUc  add,  GV/H^NOg.  On  addition  of  dilute  sul- 
phuric acid  to  an  aqueous  solution  of  the  crystallised  salts  obtained  as 
above  described,  a  colourless  precipitate  is  obtained,  which  after  some 
time — especially  when  the  water  contains  some  ether — changes  into  a 
voluminous  magma  of  fine  white  needles.  Collected  on  a  filter,  it 
contracts  on  drying  to  a  shining  mass  of  interlaced  needles. 

Glycocholic  acid  is  little  soluble  in  water,  more  readily  in  alcohol ; 
it  has  a  faint  acid  reaction,  a  bitter-  ste,  and  is  dextrorotary 

(fa]=  -f  It  yields  salts  of  neuti,  1  reaction,  of  which  the 

alkali   salts   are  readily  soluble  in  water,  those  of  the  other  metals

1284.  Taura  \><>7,  occurs  in  ox  gall  in  only 
small  quantity,  and  cannot  be  well  extracted  from  it  in  a  state  of 
purity.     To  prepare  it  the  solution  of  the  salts  from  ox  gall  is  first 

ted  with  norma]  plumbic  acetate  to  precipitate  glycocholic  acid, 

and   basic  plumbic  then  added   to  the  filtrate  to  precipitate 

taurocholic  acid.     The  latter  precipitate  is  then  washed,  decomposed 

with  sulphuretted  hydrogen  under  water,  ami  the  solution  evaporated. 

The  cry.-  Its  from  dog's  bile  form  a  better  crude  material, 

bey  contain  only  traces  of  glycocholic  acid.     The  aqueous  solution 

is  first  mixed  with  an  amount  of  basic  lead  acetate  by  far  insufficient 

for  complete  precipitation,  and  the  filtrate  precipitated  with  the  same 

nt.     Tli<-  last  precipitate  is  then  decomposed  under  water  with 

sulphuretted  hydrogen,   the  filtrate  highly   concentrated   and  mixed 

with  ether  ;  taurocholic  acid  then  pi  -  as  a  syrup  that  soon 

changes  into  needle-formed  crystals.     It  is  readily  soluble  in  water 

and  alcohol,  its  solutions  being  dextrorotary  ([«]  =  -f-  24*5°),  and  is 

readily  split  up,  either  by  boiling  with  pure  water  or  more  readily  by 

acids  and  alkalies. 

1285.  Cholic  acid,  or  cholalic  acid,  C20H40O5,  is  the  common 
decomposition  product,  together  with  glycocine  or  taurine,  of  both  the 
acids  previously  mentioned,  the  splitting  up  being  best  effected  by 
boiling  for  several  days  with  baryta  water  : 

C26H43N06  +  H20  =  C2H5N02  +  C24H40O5, 
C26H45NS07  +  H20  =  C2H7NS03  +  C24H40O5. 

The  basic  salt  contained  in  the  still  hot  liquid  is  decomposed  by 
addition  of  hydrochloric  acid,  and  the  resulting  amorphous  precipitate, 
after  washing  with  water,  dissolved  in  a  little  sodic  hydrate  solution, 
and  the  liquid,  after  addition  of  some  ether,  again  supersaturated  with

pyramids,  containing  five  molecules  of  water,  or   prisms  with  one 
molecule  of  water  which  do  not  change  in  air.     Cholic  acid  is  re

but  occurs  in  all  cases  where  lecithin  or  its  decomposition  proc

and  many  pathological  liquids.  It  occurs  especially  richly  in  the 
brain,  n  -:anee,   and   yolk   of  egsrs.     The   most  convenient 

materials  for  its  preparation  are  biliary  calculi,  which  frequently  con- 
of  pure  cholesterine.  To  obtain  it  perfectly  pure  it  must  be 
treated  with  alcoholic  potash,  in  order  to  saponify  any  fats,  and  after 
washing  recrystallised  from  hot  alcohol,  or  better  from  a  mixture  of

Cholesterine  is  a  monacid  alcohol,  C20H,3.OH,  and  as  such  is

Like  cinnami  ine  also  unites  with  two  atoms  of 

bromine,  when  solutions  of  the  two  in  carbonic  disulphide  are  mixed. 
On  <  ii  of  the  solvent  cholesterine  dibromide  is  left,  in  the 

form  of  small  colourless  needles  :  it  melts  at  147°,  is  difficultly  soluble

In  this  reaction  an  intense  red  colour  is  developed,  especially 
at  the  commencement,  which  may  be  used  in  identifying  cholesterine.

Bile  Pigments. 

1290.  The  bile  is  always  intensely  coloured,  sometimes  green 
(especially  with  birds),  sometimes  greenish  bi-own  (ox  gall),  and  finally 
bright  yellow  to  deep  brown  (with  pigs  and  human  bile).  This 
colouring  proceeds  mainly  from  two  pigments — the  green  biliverdin 
and  the  red-brown  bilirubin.  Other  pigments  are  found  in  small 
quantity  in  human  biliary  calculi. 

All  bile  pigments  contain  nitrogen,  are  insoluble  in  water,  soluble 
in  aqueous  alkalies,  and  when  treated  with  nitrous  acid  give  a  series 
of  colours,  which  are  especially  complete  in  the  case  of  bilirubin, 
with  which  the  yellowish  red  solution  is  coloured  first  green,  then 
blue,  violet,  ruby  red,  and  finally  dirty  yellow  (Gmelin's  colour  re- 
action). 

These  colouring  matters  are  most  readily  obtained  from  human 
biliary  calculi.  These  are  powdered,  treated  with  ether  alcohol  until 
all  cholesterine  is  removed,  then  treated  with  hydrochloric  acid  in 
order  to  decompose  the  calcium  compound  of  the  pigment  contained 
in  the  calculi,  then  washed  with  water  and  dried.  The  resulting 
powder  is  extracted  with  chloroform  as  long  as  any  colouring  matter 
dissolves,  and  the  filtered  chloroform  solution  evaporated.  The  dark 
residue  now  yields  bilifuscin  to  boiling  alcohol,  whilst  the  residual 
bilirubin  is  purified  by  solution  in  chloroform,  precipitation  by  alcohol, 
and  final  recrystallisation  from  chloroform. 

That  portion  originally  insoluble  in  chloroform  yields  bilij 
to  boiling  alcohol ;   the  residue,  after  renewed  treatment  with  chloro- 
form to  remove  the  last  traces  of  bilirubin,  consists  of  bUiltumi  n. 

Biliverdin  can  only  be  prepared  in  a  state  of  purity  from  bili- 
rubin. 

Bilirubin  is,  without  doubt,  a  definite  chemical  compound,  as  also 
is  biliverdin;  biliprasin  and  bilifuscin,  on  the  contrary,  are  not 
sufficiently  well  characterised  as  such.  Bilihumin  is  certainly  a 
mixture. 

1291.  1.  Bilirubin,  Cl(iK]8N203,  crystallises  from  chloroform  in 
brownish  red  tables,  little  soluble  in  alcohol  and  ether,  more  readily 
in  chloroform  and  benzene;  it  is  also  readily  soluble  in  solutions  of 
alkaline  hydrates  and  of  ammonia.  The  intensity  of  its  colouring 
power  is  very  great  in  solution  ;  when  only  3 0  J6 rto  is  present  a 
layer  1*5  cm.  thick  is  still  distinctly  yellow.  The  ammoniacal 
solution  gives  dark  brown  amorphous  precipitates  with  calcic  chloride, 
plumbic  acetate,  and  other  metallic  salts ;  in  these  compounds  one 
hydrogen  atom  has  been  replaced  by  metal,  e.g.  (C16Hl7N203)2Ca.  On 
addition  of  sodium  amalgam  to  an  alkaline  bilirubin  solution  the 
colour  is  considerably  lightened  ;  addition  of  hydrochloric  acid  then 
precipitates  brown  flocks  of  hydro-bU 'irubi n,  which  appears  to  be 
identical  with  urobilin,  the  brown  colouring  matter  of  urine. 

2.  Biliverdin,  C,6HaoN206.  Alkaline  solutions  of  bilirubin  on

intense  green  colour.  On  supersaturating  with  hydrochloric  acid, 
biliverclin  is  precipitated  as  a  fine  green  mass;  it  is  insoluble  in 
chloroform,  but  soluble  in  alcohol.  The  formation  of  biliverdin  is 
probably  represented  by  the  equation  : 

C16H17KN203  +  H20  +  0  =  C16H19KN205. 

3.  Kilifuscin,  C,6H20N2O4,  and  biliprasin,  C16H22N20,5,  are 
described  as  nearly  black,  shining,  brittle  masses,  insoluble  in  ether 
and  chloroform,  soluble  in  alcohol  and  alkalies.

PROTEIN    SUBSTANCES. 

1292.  Protein  substances  are  widely  disseminated  in  the  animal 
and  vegetable  kingdoms  ;  they  are  the  compounds  taking  the  principal 
part  in  the  physiological  changes  occurring  in  the  organism.  In  the 
animal  body,  especially  in  that  of  the  higher  animals,  they  form  the 
main  part  of  the  tissues  (hence  the  name,  from  Trpiorevto),  but 
occur  also  in  nearly  all  animal  liquids.  They  are  without  exception 
amorphous,  and  all  contain  nitrogen  in  addition  to  carbon,  hydrogen, 
and  oxygen,  in  most  cases  sulphur  also.  Accurate  formulae  have  not 
yet  been  obtained  for  any  of  these  bodies,  but  from  the  results 
obtained  it  is  certain  that  their  molecules  are  very  large  and  of  very 
complicated  structure.  In  agreement  with  this  they  do  not  diffuse 
through  membranes,  and  are  readily  decomposed  by  putrefaction  or  by 
heating  with  aqueous  acids  or  alkalies.  Amongst  the  product*  of 
these  decompositions  there  occur  regularly  ammonia,  and  amide  de- 
rivatives of  organic  nuclei,  such  as  glycocine,  leucine,  aspartic  acid, 
glutamic  acid,  and  tyrosine.  On  dry  distillation  they  yield  methyl- 
amine  and  pryridine  bases  in  addition  to  ammonia.  On  heating 
with  manganic  oxide  and  sulphuric  acid  they  yield  very  numerous 
oxidation  products,  amongst  which  there  occur  several  volatile  fatty 
acids,  from  formic  acid  upwards,  together  with  their  aldehydes  and 
nitrils,  benzaldehyde,  benzoic  acid,  «tc.  Those  protein  substances 
soluble  in  water  have  without  exception  an  action  on  polarised  light ; 
they  are  all  precipitated  by  tannic  acid,  nearly  all  by  alcohol. 

Gelatinous  Tissues  and  Gelatines. 

1293.  The  gelatinous  tissues  occur  only  in  the  animal  organism 
and  are  invariably  organised  ;  they  are,  as  such,  insoluble  in  cold  or 
warm  water,  but  swell  up  slightly  and  then  putrefy  readily.  Solutions 
of  tannins  render  them  incapable  of  putrefaction  by  converting 
them  into  leather.  On  long  boiling  with  water  they  are  converted 
into  gelatines,  whose  hot  solutions  on  cooling  become  converted  into 
a  homogeneous  jelly.  This  jelly  dries  on  exposure  to  air  into  an 
amorphous  transparent  or  semitransparent  brittle  mass,  which  only 
swells  up  in  cold  water  ;  they  are  not  dissolved  by  alcohol.  On  long 
boiling  of  the  aqueous  solutions,  more  quickly  by  heating  to  tempera- 
tures of  150°  and  above,  they  lose  the  property  of  gelatinising  on 
cooling.  On  evaporation  they  then  yield  a  mass  resembling  gelatine 
in  most  properties,  but  readily  dissolved  by  cold  water. 

From  their  properties  two  varieties  of  gelatine  may  be  distinguished, 
chondrine  and  glutine,  the  tissues  from  which  they  are  derived  being 
respectively  designated  as  chondrogen  and  collagen. 


GELATINE.  753 

Chondrogen  and  Chondrin. 

1294.  Bone  cartilage  previous  to  ossification,  and  therefore  also  the 
bony  structure  of  the  animal  foetus,  consists  essentially  of  chondrogen. 
It  is  also  found  in  the  cornea  of  the  eye,  and  in  all  permanent  cartilage, 
drc.  It  is  purified  by  treating  the  cartilage  with  cold  water,  dilute 
acids,  alkalies,  alcohol,  and  ether,  and  then  appears,  after  drying,  as  a 
structureless  semitransparent  mass. 

On  boiling  the  cartilage  of  the  ribs  for  12-24  hours  with  much 
water,  chondrin  goes  into  solution  and  gelatinises  on  cooling,  and  is 
precipitated  by  addition  of  alcohol.  It  is  laevorotary.  Alkalies  or 
ammonia  readily  and  completely  dissolve  chondrin  jelly ;  the  solution 
then  possesses  an  enormous  optical  activity  :  [a]  =  —  552°. 

Addition  of  acetic  acid  or  of  traces  of  mineral  acids  precipitates 
dissolved  chondrin,  but  a  very  slight  excess  of  the  latter  redissolves 
it.  Chondrin  behaves  similarly  with  alum  solution.  It  is  precipi- 
tated completely  by  chlorine  water,  plumbic  acetate,  and  argentic 
nitrate,  only  incompletely  by  mercuric  chloride. 

Boiling  hydrochloric  acid  or  gastric  juice  at  blood  heat  decompose 
chondrin  into  a  nitrogenous  substance,  which  still  requires  examina- 
tion, and  a  laevorotary  substance,  which  reduces  alkaline  copper 
solutions.  On  boiling  with  sulphuric  acid  much  leucine  is  formed, 
but  no  glycine. 

After  subtraction  of  the  ash  left  on  combustion,  chondrin  con- 
tains 50  %  0,  66  %  H,  14-4  %  N,  0-4  %  S,  and  28-6  %  0. 

The  gelatinous  substance  from  the  vertebrae  of  fish  behaves 
similarly  to  chondrin  except  that  it  does  not  gelatinise. 

Collagen  and  Glutine  or  Gelatine. 

1295.  Collagen,  the  substance  yielding  gelatine,  forms  the  hyaline 
intracellular  mass  of  the  connective  tissues,  of  the  skin,  sinews,  &c, 
and  also  the  organic  portion  of  bones.  On  boiling  with  water,  ossein 
dissolves  more  readily  than  chondrogen,  being  converted  into  glutine, 
which  in  the  dry  state  forms  glue,  when  in  a  state  of  greater  purity 
is  termed  gelatine.  The  latter  is  chiefly  prepared  from  the  swimming- 
bladder  of  fishes  (sturgeon).  A  hot  aqueous  solution  containing 
only  one  per  cent  of  glutine  still  gelatinises  on  cooling. 

Glutine  is  readily  dissolved  by  acids,  including  acetic,  forming 
liquid  glue ;  aqueous  alkalies  also  dissolve  it.  Unlike  chondrin, 
glutine  solutions  are  not  precipitated  by  normal  or  basic  plumbic 
acetate,  but  are  completely  by  mercuric  chloride  and  also  by  tannic 
acid. 

Glutine  is  also  laevorotary :  [a]  =  —  130°  at  30°  temperature. 
On  decomposition  with  dilute  acids  it  yields  glycocine  and  leucine. 
Whilst  containing  nearly  an  equal  amount  of  carbon  and  hydrogen 
to  chondrin,  glutine  contains  essentially  more  nitrogen  (18*3  %),  the 
oxygen  being  correspondingly  less. 

1296.  Sericine,  or  silk  gelatine,  may  be  included  amongst  these 
bodies,  as  it  possesses  the  power  of  gelatinising  in  a  very  high  degree ; 
it  is  obtained  from  raw  silk  by  long  boiling  with  water.  It  is  de- 
composed by  boiling  dilute  sulphuric  acid,  with  formation  of  a  little 
leucine,  about  5  %  tyrosine  and  10  %  serine  (§  803).

754  PROTEIN  SUBSTANCES. 

Albuminoid  Substances. 

1297.  The  albuminoids  differ  but  little  from  one  another  in  com- 
position.    After  deducting  ash  they  contain — 

C  =  50-6  —  54-3 

II  =    6-7—    7-3 

N  =  12-8  —  18-4 

S=      -4—    1-7 

O  =  20-6  —  26-8. 

Their  formulae  must  therefore  be  veiy  complex,  as  from  the  per- 
centages given  above  there  must  be  to  1  atom  of  sulphur  about  70 
to  over  300  atoms  of  carbon  and  about  110  to  over  600  atoms  of 
hydrogen.  Only  the  true  albumins  are  soluble  as  such  in  water,  the 
others  only  being  rendered  soluble  by  aid  of  small  quantities  of  acids, 
bases,  or  salts,  with  which  they  form  transient  compounds.  In 
addition  to  these  soluble  modifications  they  can  be  converted  in 
different  ways  into  insoluble  or  '  coagulated '  modifications.  These 
latter  are  insoluble  in  water,  and  as  a  rule  in  salt  solutions  also  J 
alkalies  and  acids  redissolve  them  with  difficulty.  The  conversion 
into  the  insoluble  modification  ensues  either  by  heating,  action  of 
ferments,  or  long  standing  under  strong  alcohol,  and  appears  to 
depend  on  the  formation  of  more  complicated  molecules,  accompanied 
by  elimination  of  water.  The  action  is  therefore  probably  comparable 
to  the  formation  of  anhydride  molecules  from  several  simpler  hydi 
molecules.  These  anhydride  coagulated  molecules  will  then  offer 
greater  resistance  to  the  solvent  action  of  acids  and  alkalies,  as  they 
must  be  first  hydrated  and  decomposed  into  the  simpler  molecules 
(hydrolysis). 

Every  albuminoid  can  be  brought  into  solution  by  the  action  of 
alkalies  or  acids,  especially  of  hydrochloric  acid.  The  resulting 
alkali  compounds  are  termed  albuminates ;  the  acid  derivatives,  i 
cUbumim  or  syntonins.  At  first  there  is  no  permanent  alteration 
effected  by  this  means  on  the  non-coagulated  modifications,  inasmuch 
i  neutralisation  both  the  albuminates  and  acid  albumins  again 
yield  the  original  albuminoid  >ub>tance  with  unaltered  properties. 

On  long  continuance  of  the  action,  greater  concentration  of  the 
reagent-,  and  simultaneous  action  of  heat  (especially  in  the  case  of 
the  coagulated  albumins)  decompositions  readily  ensue,  in  which  all 
albumins  yield  leucine,  tyrosine,  and  aspartic  acid  (the  vegetable 
albumins  also  yielding  udutamic  acid),  and  invariably  larger  quantities 
of  uncrvstallisable  compounds  of  unknown  nature. 

1298.  These  decompositions  occur  with  especial  ease  on  boiling 
with  moderately  dilute  sulphuric  acid,  and  also  with  solution  of 
potassic  hydrate.  The  relative  yield  of  products,  roughly  determined, 
shows  considerable  variations.  For  instance,  on  heating  with  sul- 
phuric acid  (one  part  H2S04  and  four  parts  OH2)  there  are  ob- 
tained—

On  heating  albuminoids  with  an  equal  quantity  of  bromine  and 
ten  times  as  much  water  in  closed  vessels,  the  formation  of  carbonic 
anhydride,  bromoform,  brom-acetic  acid,  oxalic  acid,  aspartic  acid, 
leucine,  and  bromanil  (§  1006)  is  observed,  there  being  obtained—

The  decomposition  of  albuminoids  by  solutions  of  alkalies  yields 
similar  products  to  those  obtained  with  sulphuric  acid.  The  forma- 
tion of  an  alkaline  sulphide  is  peculiar  to  them,  so  that  the  liquid 
evolves  sulphuretted  hydrogen  on  acidulation,  and  yields  a  black 
precipitate  of  plumbic  sulphide  on  addition  of  a  lead  salt. 

When  moist  the  albuminoids  putrefy  with  very  great  ease, 
probably  in  consequence  of  the  presence  of  ferment-like  organisms, 
with  which  as  a  matter  of  fact  the  putrefying  mass  swarms.  There 
are  then  formed  hydrogen,  Bulphnretted  hydrogen,  carbonic  acid, 
ammonia,  fcrimethylamine,  ethylamine  and  its  homologues,  and 
in  union  with   tip  :  -  of  the  series  of  fatty  acids,  from  acetic 

up  to  valerie  acid,  and  also  Leucine  and  tyrosine. 

On  heating  with  much  water  to   150°  all  albuminoids,  even  the 
il.it.  d    modifications,   are  converted   into    readily   soluble,   non- 
iccs,  without,   however,  Buffering  such  decomposi- 
tions as  attend  the  action  of  acids  and  bases. 

1299.  The  albuminoid^  show  the  following  reactions,  which  are 
used  for  their  identification  : — 

The  aqueous  saline,  or  very  weakly  acid  or  alkaline,  solutions  are 
precipitated  in  flocks  by  tannic  acid  and  by  salts  of  the  heavy  metals 
(e.g.  lead,  copper,  mercury,  &c),  and  in  most  cases  also  by  addition  of 
alcohol. 

Concentrated  acetic  acid  and  tribasic  phosphoric  acid  dissolve  all 
the  albuminoids.  The  acetic  solution  after  dilution  is  precipitated  by 
potassic  feiTO-  or  ferricyanide  or  by  potassic  platino-cyanide. 

Concentrated  hydrochloric  acid  dissolves  all  albuminoids.  On 
exposure  to  air,  especially  on  boiling,  this  solution  acquires  a  blue  or 
bluish  violet  colour. 

Strong  nitric  acid,  especially  that  containing  nitrous  acid,  colours 
them  intensely  yellow.  The  resulting  nitro  compounds  dissolve  in 
alkalies  and  ammonia  with  intensely  reddish  brown  colour,  and  on 
addition  of  mineral  acids  to  these  salts  are  reprecipitated  in  flocks. 
These  nitro  products  are  known  as  ccanthop'oteic  acids. 

A  solution  of  nitrate  of  mercury  containing  nitrous  acid  (Millon's 
reagent,  formed  by  dissolving  1  part  of  mercury  in  1  part  of  cold 
nitric  acid,  and  afterwards  diluting  with  2  parts  of  water)  gives  a  fine 
red  colour  with  albuminoids,  probably  from  the  formation  of  mercury 
xa  i  ithoproteinate. 

On  passing  chlorine  gas  into  solutions  of  the  albuminoids,  white 
flocculent  precipitates  are  formed  of  chlor  substitution  products,  contain- 
ing from  6  "5  %  to  14  %  of  chlorine,  according  to  the  duration  of  the 
action.     These  dissolve  in  aqueous  ammonia  with  formation  of  am-

756  PROTEIN  SUBSTANCES. 

ruonic  chloride  and  of  albuminoid  derivatives  richer  in  oxygen,  but 
^till  little  investigated  ;  they  are  termed  oxyprote'ins. 

Concentrated  sulphuric  acid  dissolves  the  albuminoids  in  the  c<-M  : 
on  adding  a  little  sugar  (especially  on  exposure  to  air)  a  coloration 
ensues,  at  first  red.  then  violet,  resembling  Pettenkofer's  reaction  for 
the  bile  acids 

They  change  the  colour  of  Fehling's  solution  (§  870)  from  blue  to 
violet. 

On  heating  in  air  they  soften,  then  swell  up  and  carbonise,  emitting 
the  disagreeable  odour  of  burning  feathers  or  hair;  the  charcoal 
formed  is  difficult  to  burn,  and  as  a  rule  leaves  an  ash  rich  in  calcic 
phosphate. 

In  general  they  show  all  the  properties  of  the  protein  sub- 
stances. 

1300.  Albuminoids  suffer  a  peculiar  change  when  exposed  to  the 
action  of  gastric  juice;  they  dissolve  in  it  at  blood  heat  more  oi 
quickly,  being  first  converted  into  acid  albumins,  later  into  peptones. 
These  peptones  are  soluble  in  water,  are  precipitated  by  addition  of 
much  strong  alcohol,  but  not  by  addition  of  acids,  alkalies,  or  acetic 
acid  and  potassic  ferrocyanide ;  they  are  not  converted  into  c 
modifications,  and,  unlike  the  albuminoids,  are  highly  diffusible.  The 
peptones,  therefore,  appear  to  closely  resemble  the  products  of  the 
action  of  a  temperature  of  150°  on  albuminoids  and  water,  and  are 
the  forms  in  which  the  albuminoids  of  the  food  occur  in  the  circulat- 
ing juices  of  the  animal  body. 

Albumins. 

1301.  Albumins  occur  dissolved  in  all  animal  or  vegetable  juices, 
and  on  heating  the  natural  solutions  are  converted  into  the  coagulated 
modifications,  forming  flooculent  deposits  from  dilute  solutions,  whilst 
concentrated  liquids  solidify  to  a  white  opaqn 

the  white  of  eggs.     The  temperature  of  coagulation  lie-  "  3°. 

Albumin    solutions   are   not  precipitated   by  addition    of 
quantities  of  dilute  acids,  alkaline  carbon;;  .  or  other 

alkaline  salts  in  not  too  concentrated  solution,  whilst  soluble  salts  of 
the  heavy  metals  generally  produce  precipitates.  Concentrated 
hydrochloric  acid  produces  a  preci]  olving   again  in  large 

excess  with  formation  of  acid  albumii  I  colour  soon  appearing. 

Strong  nitric  and  metaphosphoric  ac  capitate  the  albumins,

off  quickly,  the  precipitate  can  be  redissolved  in  pure  water,  whilst 
long  contact  with  alcohol  leads  to  the  formation  of  the  coagn^ 
modifications. 

Concentrated  solutions  of  the  alkaline  hydrates  convert   strong 
albumin  solutions  into  stiff  jellys  of  alkali  albuminates,  which 
soluble  in  pure  water.     The  acid  and  alkali  albuminates-  no  longer 
contain  unaltered  albumins,  as  they  are  precipitated  on  neutralisation. 

1302.  Bgg  albwmmn,  as  a  concentrated  solution,  forms  the  white 
of  birds'  eggs.  From  this  it  can  be  prepared  by  dilution  with  much 
water  and  filtration,  when  a  nearly  clear  solution  is  obtained,  which  on 
evaporation  at  temperatures  below  50°  yields  a  yellowish  transparent

brittle  mass,  of  sp.  gr.  1-314.  Some  fat  can  be  extracted  from  this 
:-eatment  with  ether.  In  water  it  first  swells  up  and  then  dissolves 
to  a  clear  liquid.  The  specific  rotary  power  of  aqueous  solution  of 
egg  albumin  for  yellow  light  is  —  35:5'.  The  precipitate  formed  by 
strong  nil  is  either  difficultly  soluble  or  insoluble  in  excess. 

Ether  precipitates  concentrated  solutions  of  egg  albumin. 

1303.  our  MM  albumin  occurs  in  all  the  liquids  of  the  animal  body, 
but  is  best  obtained  from  the  serum  of  blood,  by  dilution  with  twenty 
times  its  volume  of  water,  precipitation  of  the  globulin  by  passing 
carbonic  anhydride,  and  evaporation  of  the  filtrate  below  50=.  It 
closely  re>embles  egg  albumin,  but  possesses  a  different  rotary  power 
for  yellow  light   =  —  iier  does  not  coagulate  its  solut; 

The  precipitates  formed  by  nitric  or  hydrochloric  acid  dissolve  much 
more  readily  in  excess  of  acid  than  is  the  case  with  egg  albumin. 

The  elementary  oompwatioD  of  both  varieties  of  albumin  shows 
but  little  difference.

From  these  values  the  formula   <  -  II     jN^SC^  is  derivable,  but

1304  U  albumin  occurs  in  all  vegetable  juices,  mostly  in 

only  small  quantity  ;  it  has  not  yet  been  obtained  in  a  state  of  purity 
in  the  soluble  condition,  but  it  shows  the  general  properties  of  the 
albumins.  It  differs  in  composition  from  egg  albumin  in  the  amount 
of   nitrogen  (154  ording  to  the  source)  and   the  less 

amount  of  sulphur  i  %). 

Globulins. 

1305.  The  globulins  resemble  the  albumins  in  the  coagulability 
of  their  saline  solutions  on  boiling,  but  differ  from  them  very  essen- 
tially in  that  they  are  insoluble  in  pure  water  though  soluble  in  water 
containing  1—10  '\,  of  sodic  chloride.  Dilute  acids  readily  convert 
them  into  syntonin>  (even  1  part  of  acid  per  1,000  being  sufficient), 
whilst  very  dilute  alkalies  dissolve  them  similarly  to  alkali  albumi- 
nates, the  coagulated  modifications,  however,  being  very  difficultly 
soluble,  and  insoluble  in  common  salt. 

The  acid  globulins  are  st- parated  from  their  solutions  by  addition 
of  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid  or  of  strong  salt  solutions.  Their 
specific  rotary  power  is  very  considerable,  —  72 :  in  the  case  of  myosin- 
syntonin. 

1306  . — The  yolk  of  birds'  eggs  consists  of  a  concentrated 

solution  of  vitellin,  together  with  hti  -How  pigment  which  is 

soluble  in  ether  and  crystallisable),  lecithine,  some  salts,  and  much 
A  very  similar  -u' -stance  to  vitellin  occurs  in  the  crystalline  lense  of 
the  eye.  To  obtain  vitellin  the  yolk  of  eggs  is  shaken  with  fresh 
quantities  of  ether  until  this  latter  no  longer  acquires  any  colour  :  the 
residue  is  then  dissolved  in  a  solution  of  common  salt  (1  %),  the 
liquid  filtered,  and  the  vitellin  precipitated  by  a  large  ad 


758  PEOTEIN   SUBSTANCES. 

water.  Vitellin  is  coagulated  on  heating  (at  about  70°)  by  addition 
of  alcohol,  or  of  strong  acids,  but  is  not  precipitated  by  addition  of 
lead  or  copper  salts  to  its  sodic  chloride  solution,  nor  is  it  precipitated 
by  saturation  of  its  solution  with  sodic  chloride. 

1307.  Myosin  forms  the  chief  constituent  of  the  muscle  plasma 
enclosed  in  the  sarcolemma  tubes  of  muscular  fibre.  In  the  living 
muscle  it  occurs  in  the  liquid  state,  curdles  partially  and  transitorily 
at  every  muscular  contraction,  completely  shortly  after  death,  when 
the  rigor  mortis  sets  in.  This  curdling  is  not  a  true  coagulation.  To 
prepare  myosin,  finely  divided  flesh  is  extracted  with  a  ten  per  cent, 
solution  of  sodic  chloride,  and  the  filtered  slimy  liquid  precipitated  by 
saturation  with  common  salt  (distinction  from  vitellin).  The  floc- 
culent  precipitate  is  then  collected,  washed  with  a  saturated  solution  of 
common  salt,  and  finally  dissolved  by  addition  of  such  a  quantity  of 
water  that  a  10  %  solution  of  common  salt  results.  It  is  precipitated 
by  large  dilution  with  water,  but  with  more  difficulty  than  in  the  case 
of  vitellin.  It  is  quickly  coagulated  by  heating  with  water  or  by 
addition  of  alcohol. 

1308.  Globulin  of  the  Blood  and  of  the  Serous  Liquids. —  Globulin 
occurs,  together  with  albumin  and  albuminates,  in  the  chyle,  in  lymph, 
in  blood  and  all  serous  liquids  j  in  many  of  these  liquids  it  occurs  in 
large  quantity,  and  these  coagulate  when  no  longer  in  contact  with 
living  tissues,  with  formation  of  fibrin,  probably  from  the  union  of 
two  different  modifications  of  globulin — fibrinogen  and  fi.br ino plastic 
substances — that  which  was  originally  in  excess  then  remaining 
partly  in  solution. 

The  fibrinogen  substance  (frequently  spoken  of  as  globulin)  occurs 
in  all  serous  liquids  (pericardial  liquid,  hydrocele,  etc.),  the  fibrin- 
oplastic  substance,  or  poragluhv.il n,  in  blood  serum  (the  liquid  remain- 
ing after  the  fibrin  and  blood  corpuscles  have  been  separated  from 
blood),  in  the  aqueous  humor  of  the  eye,  «Vc. 

To    prepare   globulin,    the    respective    liquids   are    mixed    with 

about  twenty  times  their  volume  of  pure  water,  and  carbonic  acid 

then    passed  for   a   long   time  through    the   liquid.      The   globulin 

rates  in  flocks,  which  are  dissolved  to  a  clear  liquid  by  a  1-10  % 

solution  of  sodic  chloride.     On  mixing  solutions  of  the  two  varieties 

ther,  fibrin  is  formed  and  separates.  The  whole  difference  between 
tin'  twro  modifications  is  that  paraglobnlin  is  rather  more  readily 
precipitated  from  its  dilute  solutions,  and  easily  loses  the  power  of 
giving  fibrin  with  globulin.  The  latter  only  loses  its  power  of  uniting 
with  paraglobulin  very  slowly  at  ordinary  temperatures,  scarcely 
until  putrefaction  commences. 

1309.  Fibrin  is  the  product  of  the  action  on  one  another  (union) 
of  the  two  globulins  just  mentioned.  It  commences  as  soon  as  their 
common  solutions  are  out  of  contact  with  living  tissue.  The  precipi- 
tation of  fibrin  can,  however,  be  hindered  by  certain  salts,  such  as 
(Haulier's  salts',  or  by  reduction  of  the  temperature  to  0°  ;  on  the  other 
hand,  it  may  be  accelerated  by  violent  agitation  of  the  solutions. 

If  the  blood  just  freshly  drawn  from  an  artery  is  mixed  with  1 
of  its  volume  of  sodic  sulphate,  and  allowed  to  stand  quietly,  the  blood 
corpuscles  form  a  red  deposit  at  the  bottom,  and  a  clear  yellow- 
coloured  liquid  is  left     a  solution  of  blood  plasma  with  sodic  sulphate.

On  largely  diluting,  fibrin  separates.  Pure  blood  plasma  is  best 
obtained  from  horse's  blood.  This  is  quickly  cooled  to  0°,  and  allowed 
and  about  one  hour  at  this  temperature;  after  the  blood  corpus- 
cle have  settled,  the  supernatant  clear  yellow  plasma  is  poured  off. 
At  a  few  degrees  above  0°  it  coagulates  to  a  thin  jelly,  which  soon 
shrinks  together,  whilst  serum  separates.  This  behaviour  is  also 
shown  by  the  blood  of  all  the  higher  animals  still  containing  the  blood 
corpuscles  in  suspension,  but  the  separated  fibrin  carries  the  blood 
corpuscles  with  it,  and  so  forms  the  red  blood-clots. 

golated  fibrin  can  readily  be  obtained  pure  by  vigorous  whip- 
ping of  fresh  blood  with  a  bundle  of  twigs;  it  then  separates  in  a 
fibrous  state,  and  can  be  freed  from  the  blood  corpuscles  by  long-con- 
tinued kneading  under  water. 

These  fresh  white  and  elastic  flocks  of  fibrin  are  very  quickly 
digested  by  the  gastric  juice  ;  they  swell  up  in  very  dilute  hydrochloric 
acid  (1 :1000),  or  in  not  too  dilute  solutions  of  sodic  chloride,  potassic 
nitrate,  and  other  alkali  halts,  forming  a  shiny,  jelly-like  mass.  The 
flocks  shrink  in  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid,  and  only  dissolve  later 
with  violet  coloration.  Oxygen  is  readily  absorbed  by  fresh  fibrin, 
carbonic  anhydride  being  evolved  and  putrefaction  soon  ensuing; 
hydric  peroxide  is  energetically  decomposed  with  rapid  evolution  of 
oxygen. 

>ng  alcohol  on  heating  completely  coagulates  fibrin,  which  con- 
tracts, and  in  the  dry  state  forms  a  horn-like  mass,  which  no  longer 
shows  the  above  properties.

Natural  Alkali  Albuminates.' 

1311.  Cast  in  only  occurs  largely  in  the  milk  of  the  mammalia,  in 
Blight  quantity  in  yolk  of  eggs,  in  blood  and  other  animal  liquids.  It 
is  insoluble  per  se,  occurring  in  these  liquids  as  an  alkali  albuminate, 
and  is  precipitated  on  neutralising  the  alkali  by  dilute  acid  (as  in  the 
curdling  of  milk  by  the  formation  of  lactic  acid)  or  by  the  fermentive 
action  of  rennet,  the  dried  inner  stomach  of  the  calf.  These  precipi- 
tations are  only  quite  complete  in  the  absence  of  phosphates  of  the 
alkalies.  It  is  precipitated  as  albuminate  by  addition  of  readily 
soluble  salts,  e.g.  magnesic  sulphate,  as  also  by  cold  alcohol.  It  is 
somewhat  soluble  in  boiling  alcohol. 

To  prepare  it  milk  is  largely  diluted  with  water,  and  very  dilute 
acetic  acid  added  as  long  as  a  flocculent  precipitate  is  formed.  This 
latter  carries  the  butter  globules  down  with  it,  and  therefore  after 
washing  with  water  requires  treating  with  ether  and  alcohol  to  free 
it  from  fat.  It  is  then  dissolved  in  very  dilute  solution  of  sodic 
hydrate,  and  the  clear  solution  precipitated  anew  by  acetic  acid. 

When  fresh,  casein  is  very  readily  soluble  in  very  dilute  alkalies 
or  mineral  acids,  forming  albuminates  or  syntonins.     On  pouring  the 


760  PROTEIN  SUBSTANCES. 

alkaline  solutions  into  concentrated  mineral  acids,  the  acid  casein 
separates  in  flocks,  which  are  soluble  in  pure  water. 

On  dissolving  casein  in  strong  solution  of  potash,  the  formation  of 
potassic  sulphide  is  soon  observed. 

The  conversion  into  the  true  coagulated  modification  occurs  on 
boiling  milk,  on  the  surface  where  in  contact  with  air,  and  by  heating 
the  alkali  solution  to  50°  with  rennet.  In  composition  casein  clo>ely 
approaches  albumin. 

1312.  Vegetable  Caseins. — 1.  Legumin  occurs  as  alkali  albuminate 
in  leguminosse.  Softened  peas  or  beans  are  rubbed  to  a  pulp,  this 
stirred  with  much  water,  and  all  solid  matters  allowed  to  settle.  The 
supernatant  liquid,  which  is  rendered  turbid  by  fat,  is  cleared  by 
nitration  and  precipitated  by  dilute  acetic  acid.  The  flocculent  pre- 
cipitate is  collected  and  washed  with  ether  and  alcohol. 

Legumin  resembles  casein  j  it  dissolves  in  dilute  acids  and  alkalies, 
and  the  albuminate  solution  on  heating  forms  a  pellicle-like  milk. 

2.  Conglutin  is  the  alkali  albuminate  of  the  sweet  and  bitter 
almonds,  the  kernels  of  stone  fruit,  and  the  lupins.  It  is  prepared 
.similarly  to  legumin,  from  which  it  only  diners  in  elementary  com- 
position. 

3.  Gluten  casein  occurs,  together  with  other  proteTn  substances,  in 
most  cereals  and  in  the  meal  prepared  from  them.  To  obtain  it  flour 
is  kneaded  in  a  linen  bag  in  constantly  renewed  water,  until  the  latter 
is  no  longer  rendered  turbid  by  starch  passing  through ;  there  is  then 
left  a  grey,  sticky,  tenacious  mass,  termed  gluten;  it  is  a  mixture  of  at 
least  four  different  protein  substances.  100  grams  of  this  substance 
is  extracted  with  a  solution  of  4  grams  of  potassic  hydrate  in  4  litres 
of  water,  the  liquid  allowed  to  stand  several  days  separated  from 
deposited  matters,  and  acidulated  with  acetic  acid.  The  sepai-ated 
mass  is  then  successively  treated  at  ordinary  temperatures  with 
alcohol  of  60  %  and  80  %,  then  with  absolute  alcohol,  and  finally  with 
ether,  and  the  residual  gluten  casein  dried  in  vacuo. 

Gluten  casein  is  insoluble  in  water  and  alcohol,  readily  in  dilute 
acids  and  alkalies,  and  also  somewhat  soluble  in  alcohol  in  the  presence 
of  acetic  or  tartaric  acids.  On  boiling  with  water  it  is  transformed 
into  its  coagulated  modification. 

1313.  In  addition  paralbumin  may  be  mentioned,  which  causes 
the  slimy  nature  of  the  liquid  of  ovarian  cysts.  On  diluting  this 
largely,  and  passing  carbonic  anhydride  through  the  liquid,  or  addition 
of  acetic  acid,  a  flocculent  precipitate  is  obtained  which  readily  dis- 
solves in  excess  of  acids  and  alkalies.  Alcohol  precipitates  it  as  a 
flocculo-granular  mass,  which  redissolves  in  water  at  35°  to  a  slimy 
viscous  liquid. 

1314.  The  elementary  analysis  of  these  five  substances  occurring 
naturally  as  albuminates  gives  the  following  percentage  composition : —

1315.   Gluten  fibrin,  mucedin,  and  gliadin  are  the  constituents  of 


ALBUMINOID   FERMENTS.  761 

gluten  soluble  in  alcohol.  For  the  preparation  of  these  substances  the 
alcoholic  extract  from  the  preparation  of  gluten  casein  is  employed 
(§  1312,  3).  One-half  of  the  alcohol  is  distilled  off;  on  cooling  gluten 
pantos,  is  washed  with  absolute  alcohol  and  ether,  and  redis- 
solved  in  boiling  60  %  alcohol.  The  hot  filtered  liquid  on  cooling 
deposits  gluten  fibrin  as  a  tough,  brownish  yellow  mass,  becoming 
horn-like  on  drying ;  it  is  readily  soluble  in  dilute  alkalies  and  acids, 
and  swells  up  in  ammonia  solution  to  a  transparent  jelly.  It  coagulates 
in  boiling  water,  and  is  then  no  longer  soluble  in  alcohol,  dilute 
alkalies,  or  acids. 

The  alcoholic  mother  liquid  from  the  preparation  of  gluten  fibrin 
yields  a  varnish-like  residue  on  evaporation  ;  with  the  exception  of  a 
little  gluten  casein,  this  Soluble  in  60-70  %  coldalcohol ;  on  adding 
90  %  alcohol  to  the  filtrate  flocks  of  mucedin  separate,  which  are 
readily  soluble  in  dilute  acids  and  alkalies,  and  do  not  swell  in  water. 

The  strong  alcoholic  mother  liquid  contains  gliadin  (vegetable 
gelatine),  which  is  left  on  evaporation  as  a  tenacious  mass  insoluble  in 
water.  These  last-mentioned  substances  have  the  following  per-

Albuminoid  Ferments. 

1316.  Some  substances  characterised  by  their  powerful  fermentive 
action  stand  in  very  close  relation  to  some  of  the  albuminoids.  These 
are,  in  pi  >tase,  emulsin,  and  myrosin,  and  in  the  animal  body 
ptyalin,  he  ferments  of  the  pancreatic  and  intestinal  liquids. 

All  these  substances  are  soluble  in  water  and  are  precipitated  by 
alcohol,  and  also  by  plumbic  acetate  (as  lead  compounds).  They  are 
not  precipitated  by  boiling  their  aqueous  solutions,  but  lose  their 
activity  as  ferments.  They  have  mostly  not  yet  been  obtained  even 
in  a  state  of  approximate  purity. 

1317.  Emulsin,  or  synaptase,  occurs  in  the  sweet  and  bitter 
almonds,  and  is  extracted  from  the  latter  by  digestion  for  several 
hours  with  water,  the  fats  having  been  previously  removed  by  pressure. 
The  filtered  liquid  is  first  treated  with  acetic  acid  to  remove  conglutin, 
and  the  clear  solution  then  precipitated  by  strong  alcohol.  After  the 
precipitate  has  been  washed  several  times  with  alcohol,  it  is  dried 
over  sulphuric  acid  in  vacuo,  and  is  then  obtained  as  a  white  friable 
mass,  which  on  combustion  leaves  a  very  considerable  quantity  of  ash 
(20-36  %),  consisting  in  great  part  of  calcic  phosphate.  Completely 
dry  emulsin  can  be  heated  to  100°  without  affecting  its  activity.  It 
dissolves  in  great  part  in  water,  and  can  then  convert  very  large 
quantities  of  amygdalin  into  sugar,  hydrocyanic  acid,  and  benzoic 
aldehyde,  and  similarly  of  salicin  into  sugar  and  saligenin.  Aqueous 
solution  of  emulsin  readily  decomposes  with  formation  of  much  lactic 
acid.  After  subtracting  the  ash  it  contains  in  100  parts  :  C  =  42'9, 
H  =  7-1,  N  =  11-5,  S  =  1  -2,  and  O  =  37-3. 

1318.  Diastase,    or   maltin,    is   the    ferment   formed    from    the 


762  PROTEIN-   SUBSTANCES. 

gluten  constituents  of  cereals  during  germination  ;  it  converts  starch 
into  dextrin  and  maltose.  It  is  obtained  from  the  aqueous  extract  of 
freshly  germinated  barley,  by  heating  to  75°  to  coagulate  albumin  and 
then  precipi ta ting  the  diastase  by  strong  alcohol.  The  aqueous  solu- 
tion readily  decomposes  with  formation  of  acids.  En  a  fresh  state  it 
possesses  a  most  powerful  fermentive  action,  one  part  of  diastase 
transforming  100,000  parts  of  starch  suspended  in  water.  This  action 
occurs  most  rapidly  between  70Dand  75°,  but  is  totally  and  permanently 
lost  at  100°. 

1319.  M</rosia  is  the  ferment  of  mustard  seeds,  by  which  myronic 
acid   is    decomposed   into   sugar,    sulphuric   acid,   and    mustard   oil 

(§iam 

1320.  P'psin  is  contained  in  the  acid  gastric  juice  secreted  in  the 
glands  of  the  stomach,  and  can  be  separated  from  the  other  con- 
stituents by  diffusion,  as  it  will  not  pass  through  membranes.  It  is 
precipitated  by  strong  alcohol  or  plumbic  acetate,  and  also,  though 
probably  only  mechanically,  when  calcic  phosphate  or  cholesterine  are 
precipitated  from  its  solutions.  In  presence  of  acids — especially  of 
hydrochloric  acid — it  converts  all  the  albuminoids,  even  the  coagulated, 
in  very  large  quantity  fir.-t  into  syntonins  and  then  into  peptones.  It 
acts  most  quickly  at  about  40°  (blood  hea^  -carcely  altered  by 
putrefaction. 

1321.  Ferments  which  convert  starch  into  sugar  are  contained  in 
the  animal  body  in  saliva  (ptyalin),  in  the  pancreatic  secretion  (pan- 
creatine in  the  liver,  &c.  On  adding  phosphoric  acid  and  afterw 
lime  water  to  these  liquids,  the  ferments  are  carried  down  with  the 
precipitated  calcic  phosphate ;  this  is  dissolved  in  dilute  acids,  and 
then  the  ferment  precipitated  in  nocks  on  addition  of  strong  alcohol ; 
these  are  soluble  in  pure  water.  They  have  been  but  little  in- 
vestigated. 

Proteids. 

1322.  The  term  proteids  is  applied  to  several  substances  occurring 
in  the  animal  body  in  an  insoluble  state,  and  which  have  been  derived 
from  the  albuminoids  and  in  their  chemical  nature  stand  very  near 
to  the  albumins.  They  possess  the  general  protein  reactions,  are  con- 
verted into  xanthoproteic  acids,  with  yellow  coloration,  by  nitric 
acid,  mostly  give  a  rose-red  coloration  with  Millon's  reagent,  and  on 
treatment  with  concentrated  acids  and  alkalies  are  converted  slowly 
into  compounds  of  acid  albumin  or  albuminate-like  character.  On 
boiling  with  moderately  concentrated  sulphuric  acid,  or  with  strong 
alkalies,  by  dry  distillation  and  long  heating  with  water  at  150°,  they 
show  in  all  essentials  the  behaviour  of  all  protein  compounds.  Some 
of  them  are  glucosides. 

Mucus. 

1323.  Animal  mucus,  or  mucin,  occurs  in  strongly  swollen  con- 
dition in  different  secretions,  especially  in  bile,  synovia,  the  sali\ 
the  submaxillary  gland,  and  as  a  glairy  mucus  on  the  mucous  mem- 
branes of  the  respiratory  passage   and   intestinal  canal,    <tc      I

the  mucr.  in  varieties  of  snails  bv  rubbing  the  animals  to  pulp 

with  sand,  boiling  with  much  water,  and  adding  much  acetic  acid  to 
the  brown  liquid.  The  separated  mass  is  then  washed  with  dilute 
ic  acid  until  the  filtrate  no  longer  gives  a  precipitate  with  a 
in  solution,  all  salts  removed  by  means  of  water,  and  the  mass 
covered  with  dilute  lime  water.  The  mucine  swells  up  in  this,  and 
for  further  purification  is  again  precipitated  by  acetic  acid.  It  remains 
unaltered  under  alcohol. 

The  mucous  substances  swell  in  water  to  an  enormous  extent, 
Oftlly  in  the  presence  of  certain  alkali  salts,  yielding  opalescent 
liquids.     They  are  precipitated  by  alcohol,  dilute  mineral  or  organic 
acids,  but  are  dissolved  by  free  alkalies,  or  lime,  or  baryta  water,  as 
also  by  concentrated  mineral  acids.     Neutral  or  alkaline  liquids  con- 
taining mucin  are  not  precipitated  by  tannic  acid,  copper,  mercurv,

chloric acid,  and  dilute  sodic  hydrate  ;  it  contracts  in  ammoniat  al 
solution  of  cupric  oxide,  and  on  decomposition  with  sulphuric  acid

blood  corpuscles  of  snakes  and  birds.  It  can  be  readily  isolated,  as  it 
is  not  digested  by  gastric  juice  at  blood  heat  and  is  insoluble  in  water,

glands  altered  by  such  infiltrations  are  finely  divided,  are  extract*  ri 
with  ether  and  alcohol,  and  finally  digested  with  gastric  juice  at

stance then  remains  unattached.  Alkalies  dissolve  it  with  difficulty, 
converting  it  into  albuminate ;  acids  similarly  convert  it  into  acid 
albumin.  It  is  characterised  by  the  red  coloration  that  it  gives 
with  iodine  and  the  violet  or  blue  colour  with  iodine  and  sulphuric 
acid.     On  analysis  it  gives  the  following  percentages  : — 

536  C,  70  H,  15-0  N,  and  244  O  and  S  (S  being  about  1-3). 

HAEMOGLOBINS. 

1330.  The  blood  pigments,  or  haemoglobins,  occupy  a  peculiar 
position  amongst  the  protein  substances.  They  form  the  chief  con- 
stituent of   the  red  blood  corpuscles   of   the  vertebratae,  and  occur 

lived  in  the  muscle  of  the  mammalia  and  the  blood  of  some  of 
the  invert ebrata?.  e.g.  in  log  worms.  In  a  state  of  purity  all  haemo- 
globins appear  to  be  crystalline,  but  do  not  all  crystallise  equally 
well  nor  with  equal  readim-- 

To  prepare  them  the  blood  corpuscles  must  first  be  isolated  as 
far  as  possible,  which  is  best  effected  by  the  quiet  standing  for  several 
days  of  a  mixture  of  1  volume  of  defibrinated  blood  with  10  volumes 
of  a  three  per  cent,  sodic  chloride  solution.  The  red  corpuscles  then 
deposit  so  completely  that  the  liquid  can  be  poured  off  them.  The 
red  mud  is  then  brought  into  a  flask  by  means  of  water,  and  well 
shaken  after  addition  of  an  equal  volume  of  ether.  The  haemoglobin 
is  dissolved  ;  the  solution  is  filtered  as  quickly  as  possible,  cooled  to 
0°,  and  the  haemoglobin  precipitated  in  crystals  by  addition  of 
\  volume  of  alcohol.     The  colouring  matters  of  the  blood  of  the  dog.

or  human  blood.  Haemoglobin  can  be  recrystallised  by  dissolving  in 
at  40°,  quickly  filtering,  cooling  to  0°,  and  adding  alcohol. 

1331.  All  haemoglobins  are  of  a  blood  red  or  brick  red  colour 
when  in  powder ;  they  contain  iron  and  water  of  crystallisation,  and 
do  not  quite  agree  with  one  another  in  their  quantitative  com- 
position. For  instance,  100  parts  of  dried  haemoglobin  crystals 
contain  : —

the  first  containing  3-4  %  of  water  of  crystallisation,  the  latter 
9-5  %. 

The  crystalline  forms  are  very  different. 

The  blood  of  the  hippopotamus  and  the  rat  yields  rhombic  tetra- 
hedrons and  octahedrons. 

The  blood  of  the  rhinoceros  gives  hexagonal  tables,  whilst  the 
blood  of  • 

All  crystalline  blood  pigments  are  oxyhemoglobins,  i.e.  loose 
compounds    of   true  hismog  ith    oxygen,   which    latter   thev 

give  off  in  vacuo— especially  on  gently  h<  solution — and  re- 

»rb  on  exposure  to  air.     The  loosely  unit  _  n  of  the  oxy- 

hemoglobins can  also  be  readily  removed  by  easily  oxidisable  sub- 
stances— mob  a>  ferrous  or  stannous  tartrates — with  reduction  to 
haemoglobin.  Reduced  haemoglobin  and  oxyhaemoglobin  solutions 
are  characterised  by  their  absorption  spectra ;  that  of  the  latter  shows 
two  distinct  absorption  hinds,  one  in  the  yellow,  the  other  in  the 
green — both  between  Fraunhofer's  D  and  E  lines,  and  separated  by 

>nd  of  yellow IE      B  light.       The   absorption  spectrum  of  the 

haemoglobin  shows,  on  the  contrary,  only  a  single  broad  band,  thin- 
ning out  at  the  edges,  and  whose  darkest  part  covers  the  clear  inter- 

oe  between  the  bands  of  oxyhaemoglobin. 

Haemoglobin  also  unites  with  nitric  oxide  and  carbonic  oxide  gas 
to  form  relatively  very  stable  crystalline  compounds. 

Whilst  perfectly  dry  oxyhemoglobin  can  be  heated  to  100°  with- 
out alteration,  that  containing  water,  especially  when  in  solution, 
decomposes  at  about  70D  in  coagulated  albumin  and  hcematin,  a  pig- 
ment containing  iron.  The  same  decomposition  is  effected  by  the 
action  of  alkalies  or  acids. 

1332.  Hrnmatin,  C34H34N4Fe0.5,  is  usually  obtained  in  the  form 
of  a  salt  from  the  decomposition  of  oxyhaemoglobin  by  acids,  &c. 

Hcematin  hydrochloride,  or  hcemin,  is  readily  obtained  from  de- 
fibrinated  blood  by  evaporating  the  haemoglobin  solution  prepared 
from  the  deposited  red  corpuscles  in  shallow  vessels  over  sulphuric 
acid,  and  heating  the  resulting  syrup  for  some  hours  on  the  water 
bath  with  10-20  times  its  volume  of  glacial  acetic  acid.  The  liquid, 
which  contains  the  albumin  in  solution  as  acid  albumin,  on  dilution 
yields  haematin  hydrochloride  in  the  form  of  a  black  crystalline 
powder  of  metallic  lustre,  which  dissolves  readily  in  water  containing 


766  H^MATIN. 

a  little  alkali  to  a  brown  dichroic  liquid.  It  contains  5*2  %  chlorine, 
i.e.  one  atom  to  the  above  haematin  formula. 

The  formation  of  microscopic  crystals  of  haemin  affords  a  useful 
test  for  the  presence  of  blood  in  medico-legal  cases.  For  this  purpose 
only  a  very  small  portion  of  the  dried  blood  is  requisite ;  it  is  placed 
together  with  a  little  common  salt  on  an  object  glass,  a  cover  glass 
placed  over  it,  and  the  interspace  between  the  two  filled  with  glacial 
acetic  acid.  Heat  is  then  applied  until  bubbles  appear  in  the  acetic 
acid,  and  then  on  cooling  the  liquid  is  full  of  numerous  reddish  brown 
to  black  microscopic  haemin  crystals,  which  as  a  rule  show  the  form 
of  rhombic  tables. 

On  boiling  the  blood  corpuscle  deposit  with  alcoholic  sulphuric 
acid,  ii  formed  and  crystallises  on  cooling. 

1I>> matin  is  obtained  from  both  salts  by  dissolving  in  dilute 
solution  of  potassic  hydrate  and  neutralising  with  acetic  acid,  when 
it  is  precipitated  in  the  amorphous  condition,  and  after  drying  forms 
a  bluish  black  mass  of  metallic  lustre,  which  yields  a  brownish  black 
powder.  It  is  insoluble  in  water,  difficultly  soluble  in  alcohol,  some- 
what in  acetic  acid,  and  readily  soluble  in  alkaJ 

lli'inatin  corresponds  to  oxyhemoglobin.  From  reduced  haemo- 
globin another  pigment  is  obtained,  which  is  converted  into  lucmatin 
on  oxidation. 

1333.  The  other  animal  colouring  matters  stand  without  doubt 
in  close  relationship  to  haematin.  Ha?matoidin,  obtained  by  the 
decomposition  of  old  blood  -  .  r*.g.  in  the  brain,  does  not 

contain  iron  and  appears  to  1x3  identical  with  bilirubin,  or  more 
probably  with  lut'ia,  the  colouring  matter  of  the  yolk  of  eggs. 
Melanine,  the  black  pigment  of  the  choroid,  skin,  hair,  Ac,  as  also 
urobilin,  or  hydrobilirubin,  the  normal  colouring  matter  of  urine,  are 
probably  also  formed  in  the  body  from  blood  pigments. 


APPENDIX 


I.— Refraction  Equivalents  of  Organic  Compounds. 
(Comp.  p.  52.) 

It  has  been  shown   lately  by  experiments  on  unsaturated  com- 
pounds that  the  refraction  equivalent  of  carbon  is  greater  in  those 
where  double  linking  has  taken  place  between  two  carbon  atoms 
than  is  i :  the  compound  is  saturated,  or  where,  though 

unsaturated,!  ill  no  multiple  linking  of  carbon  atoms.    Each 

such  oaee  of  double  union  appeare  to  add  about  2  to  the  refraction 
equivalent ;  so  that  the  refraction  equivalent  of  the  group 

\    / 

0=0  =  2x5  +  2  =  120, 
/       \ 

I      I 
the  saturated  group  — C — C —  being  2x5  =  1O0. 

i   I 

<  txygen  has  two  values.  Where  united  to  a  carbon  atom  by  double 
linking  it  =  3*29,  whilst  in  those  cases  where  the  oxygen  is  in  union 
with  two  atoms  of  other  elements  the  value  is  reduced  to  2*71. 


II. — The  Diazo  Colours. 

Of  late  years  a  large  number  of  compounds  have  been  discovered 
containing  the  diazo  group  — N:=N —  (see  p.  576) ;  and  as  these  are 
now  of  great  technical  importance  on  account  of  the  brilliant  shades 
of  yellow,  orange,  and  scarlet  which  they  impart  to  various  fabrics 
when  used  as  dyes,  it  has  been  considered  necessary  to  add  this  brief 
account  of  their  preparation  and  properties. 

The  colouring  matters  belonging  to  the  present  class  may  be  con- 
sidered as  being  formed  on  the  type  of  amido-azobenzene  and  '  Bis- 
marck  brown,'  which  have  already  been  mentioned  (p.  578),  but 
containing  acid  instead  of  basic  radicals.  Thus,  when  nitrous  acid 
acts  upon  a  cold  alcoholic  solution  of  aniline,  diazoamido-benzene  is 
formed,  in  accordance  with  the  equation  : 

2C6H5.NH2  +  HN02  =  C6H5.N2.N<^H    +  2H20. 


768  APPENDIX. 

This  diazoamido-benzene,  when  allowed  to  stand  for  some  time  in 
the  presence  of  alcohol  and  an  aniline  salt,  undergoes  isomeric  trans- 
formation into  amidoazo-benzene,  C6H5.N«.C6H4(NH2),  a  substance 
of  feeble  tinctorial  power  long  known  as  '  aniline  yellow.'  Similarly, 
when  nitrous  acid  acts  upon  metadiamido-benzene,  the  first  product 

TT 

is    diazodiamido-benzene,     (NH2)C6H4.N2.N<^p  „  ,„„  y      which 

changes  into  the  isomeric  compound  triamido-azobenzene,  or  'Bis- 
marck brown,'  (NH2)C6H4.N2.CeH3(]SrH2)2.  It  will  be  seen  that 
this  last  compound  as  well  as  '  aniline  yellow,'  on  which  type  the 
diazo  colours  are  formed,  consist  of  two  aromatic  nuclei  having  one  or 
more  hydrogen  atoms  replaced  by  an  amido  group  and  linked  together 
by  the  diazo  group. 

A  body  intermediate  between  amido-azobenzene  and  triamido-azo- 
benzene,  viz.  dianiid-o-azobenzene,  is  formed  by  the  action  of  diazo- 
benzene  chloride  upon  metadiamido-benzene  : 

C6H5.N2.C1  +  C6H4(NH2)2  =  C6H5.N2.C6H3(NH2)2  +  HC1. 

This  colouring  matter,  known  by  the  name  of  '  chrysoidine,' 
is  an  orange  dye  and  forms  beautifully  crystalline  salts  having  a 
beetle-green  metallic  lustre. 

The  last  reaction  is  typical  of  the  formation  of  the  diazo  colours 
generally.  Diazo  compounds  of  benzene  and  its  homologues  are  made 
to  act  upon  the  phenols  and  their  sulphonic  acids,  primary  and 
secondary  monamines,  &c.  The  first  of  these  colours  made  on  a  large 
scale  was  an  orange  dye  formed  by  the  action  of  diazo-sulphanilic  acid 
upon  dimethyl  aniline  and  having  the  constitution  : 

(HS03)C6H4.N2.C6H4.N(CH3)2. 

The  value  of  these  dyes  is  greatly  increased  by  the  presence  of 
acid  radicals,  the  most  valuable  and  widely  known  of  these  colours 
being  the  various  shades  of  scarlet  produced  by  the  action  of  diazo- 
xylene  and  diazo-cumene  chloride  upon  the  disulphonic  acid  of  /3-naph- 
thol,  and  having  therefore  the  constitution  : 

C6H3(CH3)2.N2.C10H4(HO)(HSO3)2,  &c. 

These  colours  are  rapidly  replacing  cochineal,  which  they  equal  in 
brilliancy  and  fastness  and  greatly  excel  in  tinctorial  power. 

By  using  the  sulphonic  acids  of  diazo-benzene  and  its  homologues, 
and  the  disulphonic  acid  of  /3-naphthol,  a  series  of  diazo  colours  con- 
taining three  HS03  groups  is  obtained,  these  also  being  various  shades 
of  orange  and  scarlet.     These  bodies  have  the  constitution  : 

(HSO3)C6H4.N2.C10H4(HO)(HSO3)2 ; 
(HS03)C6H2(CH3)2.N2.C1 0H4(HO)(HSO3)2,  <fcc. 

It  is  unnecessary  to  give  here  a  detailed  account  of  each  of  the 
diazo  colours,  as  their  general  chemical  history  will  be  readily  com- 
prehended from  the  above-given  typical  examples.  The  bodies  formed 
from  diazo-benzene  and  its  homologues  and  p-naphthol-disulphonic 
acid  increase  in  redness  as  the  homologous  series  is  ascended.  Thus 
diazo-benzene  chloride  gives  an  orange  and  diazo-cumene  a  bluish 
scarlet,  these  two  extremes  being  connected  by  intermediate  shades. 


APPENDIX.  769 

Another  class  of  diazo  colours  has  recently  been  discovered,  having 
the  constitution  of  three  substituted  aromatic  nuclei  linked  together 
by  two  diazo  groups.  These  compounds  are  formed  by  converting  the 
auiido  group  of  amidoazo-henzene  and  its  homologues  (or  their 
sulphonic  acids)  into  a  diazo  group  by  the  action  of  nitrous  acid.  To 
take  a  typical  example  : 

C6H5.N,C6H4(NH2)  +  HN0.2  +  HC1 

Arnidoazo-benzene. 

=  Cr,H5.N,.C6H4.N2.Cl  +  2H20. 

1  Hazonzo-benzene  chloride. 

The  diazo-azo  compounds  are  then  made  to  act  upon  the  phenols 
or  their  sulphonic  acids,  when  they  give  rise  to  the  formation  of 
colouring  matters  of  various  shades  of  scarlet  and  having  the  con- 
stitution (,,(3H5N,.Ct-H4.N.2.C10H4(HO)(HSO3)2,  &c. 

The  colours  of  this  group  have  a  greater  tinctorial  power  than 
have  those  previously  treated.
