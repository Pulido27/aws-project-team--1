Yet  heaven,  and  earth,  and  hell, 
Proclaim  God  sitteth  on  the  throne,

When  men  and  devils  join  ; 
'Gainst  all  the  powers  of  Satan  arm, 
In  righteousness  divine.

His  onsets  to  repel  ; 
Quench  all  his  fiery  darts,  and  chase 
The  iiend  to  his  own  hell.

And  deeply  in  the  spirit  groan,

If  God  be  with  us  there  ; 
We  may  walk  through  her  darkest  shade, 
And  never  yield  to  fear. 

2  I  could  renounce  my  all  below, 

It*  my  Creator  bid  ; 
And  run,  if  Jesus  callM  to  go, 
And  die  as  Moses  did. 

3  Might  I  hut  climb  to  Pisgali's  top, 

And  view  the  promised  land  ;

My  flesh  itself  would  long  to  drop, 
And  pray  for  the  command. 

4  Clasped  in  my  heavenly  Father's  arms, 
I  would  forget  my  breath, 
And  lose  my  life  among  the  charms 
Of  so  divine  a  death.

And  feasts  his  saints  to-day ; 
Here  we  may  sit,  and  see  him  here, 
And  love  and  praise,  and  pray. 

3  One  day  in  such  a  place, 

Where  thou,  my  God,  art  seen, 
Is  sweeter  than  ten  thousand  days 
That's  spent  in  guilt  and  sin.

In  such  a  frame  as  this, 
And  sit  and  sing  herself  away 
To  everlasting  bliss.

Each  other  to  be  parted ;

Ami  meet  the  saints  with  joy  ; 
Our  sighings  o'er,  we'll  part  no  more^ 
But  reign  with  Christ  in  glory.

For  to  adore  their  Saviour  : 
High  they  can  raise,  their  songs  of  praise, 

And  follow  him  for  ever. 
But  when  they  part,  it  grieves  their  heart 

They  here  are  so  united  ; 
They  lain  would  he  in  company, 
Always  they're  so  delighted. 

3  Well  brethren  dear,  dont  let  us  fear, 

We  soon  shall  live  together  ; 
When  Christ  descends,  to  call  his  friends, 

We  then  shall  meet  each  other  ; 
Then  to  sit  down,  around  the  throne, 

With  saints  and  lovely  Jesus; 
Eternal  love  we'll  sing  ahove, 
And  nothing  then  will  grieve  us. 

4  The  Lamb  appears,  to  wipe  all  tears, 

And  to  complete  our  glory  ; 
Then  shall  we  rest,  with  all  the  blest, 

And  tell  the  lovely  story. 
To  sit  and  tell,  Christ  loved  us  well, 

And  that  while  we  were  sinners; 
Heaven  will  ring,  while  saints  do  sing, 
Glory  to  the  Redeemer,

Come  dear  friends  and  mourn  with  me, 

In  my  afflicted  state  ; 
I  am  bereavM  as  you  may  sec, 

Of  my  dear  loving  mate. 

Her  heart  was  bound  with  mine  in  love 
Good  works  for  to  maintain  ; 

But  she  has  gone  to  Christ  above 
For  ever  there  to  reign. 

Why  do  you  mourn,  perhaps  you'll  say, 
Since  God  has  thought  it  best 

To  take  her  soul  from  earth  away, 
To  its  eternal  rest  I 

*Tis  for  my  loss  that  I  complain, 

But  I  will  mourn  no  more, 
Since  my  great  loss  is  but  her  gain, 

She's  found  the  heavenly  shore. 

My  children  cry,  no  mother  by, 

To  dandle  on  the  knee  ; 
The  breach  is  great,  it  doth  create, 

Much  grief  as  all  may  see. 

But  I  do  find  my  heart  inclin'd, 

To  lean  upon  the  Lord  ; 
Who  doth  me  bless,  in  my  distress, 

And  doth  his  help  afford. 
Since  it  is  so.  let  sorrows  go, 

My  God  hath  sent  his  rod  :

And  know  that  he  is  God.

Is  took  away  and  gone. 

2  It  grieves  my  heart,  'tis  hard  to  part 

With  one  that  was  so  kind  ; 
Where  shall  I  go  to  vent  my  smart, 
Or  ease  my  troubled  mind. 

3  In  wisdom's  ways,  we  spent  our  days, 

Much  comfort  we  did  find  ; 
But  he  is  gone,  in  dust  he  lays, 
But  I  am  left  behind. 

4  But  1*11  repair,  to  Jesus,  where 

I'll  raise  my  troubled  breast ; 
To  Christ  above,  who  is  my  love 
And  mine  eternal  rest.

And  see  the  flaming  skies  ! 

3  How  shall  I  leave  my  tomb  ? 

With  triumph  or  regret  ? 
A  fearful  or  a  joyful  doom, 

A  curse  or  blessing  meet  ? 
Will  angel  bands  convey 

Their  brother  to  the  bar  ? 
Or  devils  drag  my  soul  away 

To  meet  its  sentence  there  ? 

4  Who  can  resolve  the  doubt 

That  tears  my  anxious  breast  ? 
Shall  I  he  with  the  damn'd  cast  out, 

Or  numbered  with  the  blest  ? 
I  must  from  God  be  driven, 

Or  with  my  Saviour  dwell  ; 
Must  come  at  his  command  to  heaven^ 

Or  else  depart  to  hell.

Before  the  fields,  before  the  floods, 

I  dwelt  at  his  right  hand. 
When  he  adorn'd  the  skies, 

And  built  them,  I  was  there, 
To  order  when  the  sun  should  rise, 

And  marshal  every  star. 
When  he  pour'd  out  the  sea,

Nor  is  the  strongest  free.

Before  we  feel  the  smart.

Secured  from  hurt  and  harm  : 
Their  Saviour  leads  them  gently  thro* 
Or  bears  them  on  his  arm.

And  yet  we  daily  see, 
They  differ  in  their  time  and  kind, 
Duration  and  degree.

And  walk  with  him  to  heaven.

2  The  way  the  holy  prophets  went, 
The  road  that  leads  from  banishment: 

The  King's  .highway  of  holiness, 
I'll  go,  for  all  his  paths  are  peace. 

3  This  is  the  way,  I  long  have  sought 

And  mourn'd  because  I  found  it  not; 
My  grief  a  burden  long  has  been, 
Because  I  was  not  sav'd  from  sin. 

4  The  more  I  strove  against  its  power, 

I  felt  its  weight  and  guilt  the  more  ; 
Till  late  1  heard  my  Saviour  say, 

"  Come  hither,  soul,  I  am  the  way." 

5  Lo  !  glad  I  come,  and  thou,  blest  Lamb, 

Shalt  take  me  to  thee,  whose  I  am  $ 
Nothing  but  sin  have  I  to  give, 
Nothing  but  love  shall  I  receive. 

6  Then  will  I  tell  to  sinners  round, 

What  a  dear  Saviour  I  have  found, 
I'll  point  to  thy  redeeming  blood, 

And  say,  "Behold  the  Way  to  God!'' 

HYMN  66.  c.  m. 

1  My  God,  my  portion,  and  my  love, 
My  everlasting  All  : 
I've  none  but  thee  in  heaven  above, 
Or  on  this  earthly  ball. 

£  What  empty  things  are  ail  the  skies, 
And  this  inferior  clod !

There's  nothing  here  deserves  my  joys, 
There's  nothing  like  my  God. 

And  whilst  upon  my  restless  bed, 

Among  the  shades  I  roll, 
If  my  Redeemer  shows  his  head, 

'Tis  morning  with  my  soul. 

To  thee  we  owe  our  wealth,  and  friends, 
And  health,  and  safe  abode  ; 

Thanks  to  thy  name  for  meaner  things ; 
But  they  are  not  my  God. 

Were  I  possessor  of  the  earth, 
And  call'd  the  stars  my  own, 

Without  thv  graces  andthyselty 
I  were  a  wretch  undone. 

Let  others  stretch  their  arms  like  seas., 

And  grasp  in  all  the  shore  : 
Grant  me  the  visits  of  thy  face, 

And  I  desire  no  more. 

HYMN  67.  s.   m/

When  the  tempter  came  in 

With  his  old  subtle  sin, 
And  infected   my  spirit  with  pride* 

But  I  felt  it  too  soon, 

That  my  Saviour  was  gone ; 
Swiftly  vanishing  out  of  my  sight, 

My  triumph  and  boast 

On  a  sudden  were  lost, 
And  my  day  it  was  turned  into  night

And  make  my  .Redeemer  depart :

Or  come  my  Redeemer  to  see  t

By  actions,  words,  and  tempers  show? 
That  I  my  heavenly  Master  know, 
And  serve  with  heart  sincere.

To  those  that  on  my  pleasure  wait  ; 

The  stumbling-block  remove  :

When  morning  brings  the  light  j 
I  seek  his  blessing  ev'ry  noon

While  sinners  perish  in  surprise 
Beneath  thy  angry  rod.

And  no  sad  changes  feel  ; 
They  neither  fear,  nor  trust  thy  name^ 
Nor  learn  to  do  thy  will. 

5  But  I  with  all  my  cares, 

Will  lean  upon  the  Lord ; 
Will  cast  my  burdens  on  his  arm, 
And  rest  upon  his  word.

But  Canaan's  land  is  just  before, 

Sweet  spring  is  coming  on  ; 
A  few  more  beating  winds  and  rains, 

And  winter  will  be  gone. 
4  Sometimes  like  mountains  to  the  sky* 

Black  Jordan's  billows  roar, 
Which  often  makes  the  pilgrims  fear 

They  never  will  get  o'er ; 
But  let  us  gain  mount  PisgaU's  top,

To  fright  our  souls  may  Jordan  roar, 

And  hell  may  rage  in  vain,

Brink  endless  pleasures  in.

Upon  a  dying  bed. 

Lingering  about  these  mortal  shores. 

She  makes  a  long  delay, 
'Till,  like  a  flood  with  rapid  force 

Death  sweeps  the  wretch  away. 

Then  swift  and  dreadful  she  descends 

Down  to  the  fiery  coast, 
Amongst  abominable  fiends, 

Herself  a  frighted  ghost. 

Not  all  their  anguish  and  their  blood 

For  their  old  guilt  atones, 
JNor  the  compassion  of  a  God. 

Shall  hearken  to  their  groans.

And  wip'd  their  tears  away. 

2  E're  long  they  meet  again  with  joy 

(Secure  no  more  to  part) 
Where  praises  every  tongue  employ, 
And  pleasure  fills  each  heart. 

3  Thus  all  the  preachers  of  his  grace 

Tlieir  children  soon  shall  meet ; 
Together  see  their  Saviour's  face, 
And  worship  at  his  feet. 

4  But  they  who  heard  the  word  in  vain, 

Tho  oft  and  plainly  warned  ; 
Will  tremble  when  they  meet  again 
The  ministers  they  scorn'd. 

5  On  your  own  heads  your  blood  will  fall 

If  any  perish  here  ; 
The  preachers  who  have  told  you  all 
Shall  stand  approv'd  and  clear. 

6  Yet  Lord,  to  save  themselves  alone 

Is  not  their  utmost  view  ; 
O !  hear  their  prayer,  thy  message  own* 
And  save  their  hearers  too.

They  gnash  their  teeth,  and  weep  &sigb, 
And  wring  their  hands  in  vain.

Sink  to  endless  flame  ; 
With  shrieks  and  howls  and  bitter  cries, 
Never  to  rise  again.

See  the  universal  blaze  ! 

Earth  and  heaven 
Melt  before  the  Judge's  face.

Darken'd  into  endless  night. 
When  with  angel  hosts  surrounded, 

In  his  Father's  glory  bright, 
Beams  the  Saviour, 
Shines  the  everlasting  Light.

Make  thine  almighty  arm  my  trust.

From  Satan's  wiles,  who  still  betrays,

Is  there  a  God  that  sees  or  hears, 
The  things  below  the  skies,

Did  my  mistake  amend  ;

But  here  I  learnt  their  end.

The  thoughtless  wretches  go, 
And  Oh  !  that  dreadful  fiery  deep, 
That  waits  their  fall  below.

And  all  my  powers  are  thine.

1  Lord,  all  I  am  is  known  to  thee$ 

In  vain  my  soul  would  try 
To  shun  thy  presence,  or  to  flee 
The  notice  of  thine  eye. 

2  Thy  all-surrounding  sight  surveys 

My  rising  and  my  rest, 
My  public  walks,  my  private  ways, 
The  secrets  of  my  breast. 

3  My  thoughts  lie  open  to  thee,  Lord, 

Before  they're  formM  within, 
And  ere  my  lips  pronounce  the  word, 
Thou  know'st  the  sense  I  mean. 

4  0  wond- j'ous  knowledge,  deep,  and  high! 

Where  can  a  creature  hide  ? 
Within  thy  circling  arms  I  lie, 
Beset  on  every  side. 

$  So  let  thy  grace  surround  me  still, 
And  like  a  bulwark  prove, 
To  guard  ray  soul  from  cv'ry  ill, 
Secur'd  by  Sovereign  love.

But  by  believing  thee  :

2  My  vehement  soul  cries  out,  oppressed,. 

Impatient  to  be  freed  !. 
Nor  can  I,  Lord,  nor  will  I  rest, 
Till  I  am  sav'd  indeed.

1  *Tis  a  point  I  long  to  know, 

Oft  it  causes  anxious  thought 
Do  I  love  the  Lord  or  no  ; 
Am  I  his,  or  am  I  not  I 

3  If  I  Jove,  why  am  I  thus  ? 

Why  this  dull  and  lifeless  frame? 
Hardly,  sure,  can  they  he  worse, 
Who  have  never  heard  his  name; 

3  Could  my  heart  so  hard  remain, 

Pray'r  a  task  and  burden  prove  j

Faith  is  weak  in  all  I  io  ; 

You  that  love  the  Lord  indeed, 

Tell  me  is  it  thus  with  you  ? 

6  Yet;  I  mourn  my  stubborn  will, 

Find  my  sin  a  grief  and  thrall ; 
Should  I  grieve  for  what  I  feel, 
If  I  did  not  love  at  all  ? 
f  Could  I  joy  with  saints  to  meet, 
Choose  the  ways  I  once  abhorrM:

Find,  at  times,  the  promise  sweet* 
If  I  did  not  love  thee,  Lord  ? 

Lord,  decide  the  doubtful  case  ! 

Thou,  who  art  thy  people's  sun  f 
Shine  upon  thy  work  of  grace, 

If  it  be  indeed  begun. 

Let  me  love  thee  more  and  more*.

His  dear  anointed  One ; 
He  cannot  turn  away 

The  presence  of  his  Son  : 
His  Spirit  answers  to  the  blood, 
And  tells  me  I  am  born  of  God, 

My  God  is  reconciled, 

His  pardoning  voice  I  hear  j 
He  owns  me  for  his  child,

By  thee  we  shall  break  thro'  them  all, 
And  sing  the  song  of  Moses.

To  which  thou  shalt  restore  us, 

The  cross  despise  for  that  high  prize, 

Which  thou  hast  set  before  us  : 

And  if  thou  count  us  worthy,

HYMN  238,  c.  M. 

1  I  hate  the  tempter  and  his  charms, 
I  hate  his  flattering  breath  ; 
The  serpent  takes  a  thousand  forms, 
To  cheat  our  sonls  to  death, 

j!f  He  feeds  our  hopes  with  airy  dreams,, 
Or  kills  with  slavish  fear ; 
And  holds  us  still  in  wide  extremes, 
Presumption  or  despair. 

3  Now  he  persuades,  how  easy  'tis, 

To  walk  the  road  to  heaven  : 
Again  he  swells  our  sins,  and  cries 
They  cannot  he  forgiven. 

4  He  bids  young  sinners,  yet  forbear 

To  thuik  of  God  or  death  : 


213 

For  prayer  and  devotion  are, 
But  melancholy  breath. 

5  He  tells  the  aged,  they  must  die, 

And  His  too  late  to  pray  ; 
In  vain  for  mercy,  now  they  cry, 
For  they  have  lost  their  day. 

6  Thus  he  supports  his  crttel  throne, 

By  mischief  and  deceit, 
And  drags  the  sons  of  Adam  down 
To  darkness  and  the  pit. 

7  Almighty  God  cut  short  his  pow*r, 

Let  him  in  darkness  dwell ; 
And  that  lie  vex  the  earth  no  more, 
Confine  him  down  to  hell.

Careless  sinner.

Will  surprise  your  trembling  heart 
When  you  hear  your  condemnation.

And  ijpels  no  sorrow  there  ;

But  n.ow  in  robes  immortal  pent, 
It  lives  for  ever  mine.

And  every  word  and  every  thought 
Must  pass  his  scrutiny.

And  view  the  unwearied  sun, 
May  we  set  out  to  win  the  prize. 
And  after  glory  run. 

5  And  when  our  days  are  past, 

And  we  from  time  remove, 
O  may  we  in  thy  bosom  rest^ 
The  bosom  of  thv  love. 

HYMN  252.  p.  m. 

1  See  the  eternal  Judge  descending, 
Seated  on  his  Father's  throne  ; 
Now  poor  sinner  Christ  wTill  shew  thee 
He  is  the  eternal  Son. 
Trumpets  call  thee, 
Come  to  hear  thy  awful  doom* 


226 

2  Hoar  the  sinner  now  lamenting. 

At  the  thoughts  of  future  pain  ; 
Cries  and  tears  he  now  is  venting. 
But  he  cries  and  weeps  in  vain. 
Greatly  mourning 
That  he  ne'er  was  born  again* 

3  Yonder  stands  the  lovely  Saviour 

With  the  marks  of  dying  love, 
O  that  I  had  sought  his  favour 

When  I  felt  his  spirit  move  : 
Doomed  justly, 
For  I  have  against  him  strove* 

4  All  his  warnings  I  have  slighted, 

When  he  daily  sought  my  sou|? 
If  some  vows  to  him  I  plighted, 
Yet  for  sin  1  broke  the  whole  : 
Golden  moments 
How  neglected  did  they  roll. 

5  Yonder  stands  my  Godly  neighbors* 

Who  were  once  dcspis'd  by  me, 
They  arc  clad  in  dazzling  splendor, 

Waiting  my  sad  fate  to  see  : 
Farewell  neighbors! 
Dismal  gulf  I'm  bound  for  thee, 

6  Hail  ye  ghosts  who  dwell  in  darkness, 

GrovMing,  rattling  of  your  chains  ! 
Christ  has  now  pronounced  my  sentence^ 
For  to  dwell  in  endless  pains1 : 


227 

Down  I'm  rolling, 
Never  to  return  again,* 

7  Now  experience  plainly  shows  me, 

Hell  is  not  a  feeble  thing, 
L6  I  see  my  friends  in  glory, 

Round  the  throne  they  ever  sing  s 
I'm  tormented 
By  an  everlasting  stingo 

HYMN  253. 

1  Jesus,  and  shall  it  ever  be, 
A  mortal  man  asham'd  of  thee! 
Asham'd  of  thee  whom  Angels  praise, 
Whose  glories  shine  thro'  endless  days  ! 

£  Asham'd  of  Jesus  ^—sooner  far; 
Let  evening  blush  to  own  a  star ! 
He  sheds  the  beams  of  light  divine, 
On  this  benighted  soul  of  mine* 

3  Asham'd  of  Jesus  !  just  as  soon 
Let  midnight  be  asham'd  of  noon  ! 
?Tis  midnight  with  my  soul  till  he 
Bright  Morning-star  bids  darkness  flee, 

4  Asham'd  of  Jesus  !  that  dear  friend 
On  whom  my  hopes  of  heaven  depend  : 
No  when  I  blush  be  this  my  shame, 
That  I  no  more  revere  his  name. 

5  Asham'd  of  Jesus !  yes  I  may 
When  I've  no  sins  to  \yash  away 


228 

No  tears  to  wipe,  no  good  to  crave, 
No  fears  to  quell,  no  soul  to  save. 

6  Till^tlicn,  nor  is  my  boasting  vain, 
Till  then  I  boast  a  Saviour  slain  ; 
And  0  !  may  this  my  glory  be, 
That  Christ  is  not  asham'd  of  me. 

HYMN  254.  s.  m. 

1  My  soul  repeat  his  praise, 

Whose  mercies  are  so  great ; 
Whose  anger  is  so  slow  to  rise, 
So  ready  to  abate. 

2  God  will  not  always  chide  ; 

And  when  his  strokes  are  felt, 
His  strokes  are  fewer  than  our  crimes, 
And  lighter  than  our  guilt. 

3  High  as  the  heav'ns  are  rais'd 

Above  the  ground  we  tread, 
So  far  the  riches  of  his  grace 
Our  highest  thoughts  exceed. 

4  His  power  subdues  our  sins, 

And  his  forgiving  Love. 
Far  as  the  east  is  from  the  west* 
Doth  all  our  guilt  remove. 

5  The  pity  of  the  Lord 

To  those  that  fear  his  name, 
Is  sucli  as  tender  parents  feci 
He  knows  our  fe'eble  frame* 


229 

6  Our  clays  are  as  the  grass, 

Or  like  the  morning  flower ; 
If  one  sharp  blast  sweeps  o'er  the  field. 
It  withers  in  an  hour, 

7  But  thy  compassions  Lord, 

To  endless  years  endure  ; 
And  children's  children  ever  find 
Thy  word  of  promise  sure. 

HYMN  255.  c.  m. 
1  Youth  when  devoted  to  the  Lord, 
Is  pleasingin  his  eyes  ; 
A  flower  though  offered  in  the  bad, 
Is  no  vain  sacrifice, 

£  *Tis  easier  work  if  we  begin 
To  fear  the  Lord  betimes, 
While  sinners  who  grow  old  in  sin. 
Are  hardened  by  their  crimes. 

3  It  saves  us  from  a  thousand  snares. 
To  mind  religion  young  ; 
Grace  will  preserve  our  following  years4. 
And  make  our  virtues  strong. 

To  thee  almighty  God,  to  thee 
Our  hearts  we  now  resign  ; 
'Twill  please  us  to  look  back  and  see, 
That  our  whole  lives  were  thine. 
HYMN   256.  c.  m. 
Protect  us  Lord  from  fatal  harm  j 
Behold  our  rising  woes  j 
U 


2S0 

We  trust  alone  thy  powerful  arm. 
To  scatter  all  our  foes. 

Their  tongue  is  like  a  poison'd  dart. 
Their  thoughts  are  full  of  guile; 

While  rage  and  malice  swell  their  heart, 
They  wear  a  peaceful  smile. 

0  God  of  grace,  thy  guardian  care 

When  foes  without  invade, 
Or  spread  within  a  deeper  snare, 

Supplies  our  constant  aid. 

Let  falsehood  flee  before  thy  face, 
Thy  heavenly  truth  extend ; 

All  nations  taste  thy  heavenly  grace, 
And  all  delusion  end. 

With  daily  bread  the  poor  supply, 

The  cause  of  justice  plead, 
And  be  thy  church  exalted  high. 

With  Christ  the  glorious  head. 

HYMN  257.  i.  if. 

Amongst  the  assemblies  of  the  great, 
A  greater  Ruler  takes  his  seat  ; 

The  God  of  heaven  as  judge  surveys, 
Those  men  on  earth  and  all  their  ways* 

They  know  notLord,  nor  will  they  know, 
Dark  are  the  ways  in  which  they  go: 

When  will  they  once  defend  the  poor, 
That  foes  mav  vex  thy  church  no  more. 


231 

Arise,  0  Lord,  and  let  thy  Son 
Possess  his  universal  throne, 

And  rule  the  nations  with  a  rod  : 
He  is  our  Judge  and  ho  our  God
